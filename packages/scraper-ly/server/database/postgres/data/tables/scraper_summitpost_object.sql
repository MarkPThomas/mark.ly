Collectively these three canyons are known as the tri-canyon areas (Millcreek Canyon, Big Cottonwood Canyon, &amp;amp; Little Cottonwood Canyon), with the Cottonwood Canyons being popular for a multitude of activities such as cycling, hiking, snowshoeing, picnicking, backcountry skiing, fishing, mountaineering, and rock climbing. &lt;a href=\"http://www.utah.com/ski/resorts/brighton.htm\"&gt;Brighton&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"http://www.utah.com/ski/resorts/solitude.htm\"&gt;Solitude&lt;/a&gt; ski resorts are also located at the top of the canyon and are accessible via public transit.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;During the mid-1800s, miners sought their fortune in gold and silver in this canyon, and remnants of the old mines can still be found in the canyon.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The spectacular vistas of the 15 mile long canyon are carved by the erosive powers of its rivers, leaving behind rugged and broken cliffs of smooth hard quartzite. While at first glance these cliffs don\'t appear to hold much climbing potential, they actually sport many good routes on solid rock ranging from 5.4-5.13d.  The quartzite is hard and slick, and the holds form at odd angles requiring unique body positions to use, but the angular holds abound for crimping and edging. Another aspect of climbing in Big Cottonwood Canyon is that the routes are often steeper than they look. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Because of the nature of the quartzite, many routes in the canyon are difficult to protect, the result being that some of the routes in the canyon require expertise with nutcraft. New routes have proliferated in the 80s and 90s with the improvement of power drills, and there are now many bolted routes in the canyon that once were unprotectable. In some cases, routes may have a mixture of trad climbing with a few bolts here and there for the runouts. Bolting of existing routes is highly discouraged by the local climbing community, but bolting of a new route, if done carefully and tastefully, can be acceptable. Most of the routes ascended before the 80s were done from the ground up, and only recently have the newer routes been bolted on rappel.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In general, Big Cottonwood Canyon sports many single-pitch climbs that can be top-roped, with a good number of the routes\' anchors being accessible with out an initial lead climb.  Because of this, it is a good canyon for beginning climbers or those who want to practice harder routes. There are also a number of short multi-pitch routes ranging from 2 to 4 pitches.  A big draw for climbing in this canyon is the abundance of shady crags, and climbers at Dogwood crag and the Storm Mountain Area can end the day with a picnic at the neighboring picnic areas.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;While there are many possible routes in the canyon, most of the routes listed in guidebooks are within a 15 minute hike from the road. Due to the laziness of local craggers, there are many unrecorded and unclimbed routes on the cliffs higher up the steep canyon walls.&lt;br&gt;&lt;a name=\"two\"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;table class=\"inline_image_thumbs\"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=107621\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/107621.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=107625\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/107625.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=107906\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/107906.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_2\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Getting There&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;font color=\"blue\"&gt;&lt;u&gt;By Car&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/font&gt;:&lt;br&gt;Big Cottonwood Canyon is located at approximately 7000 South Wasatch Blvd., about 12 miles southeast of downtown Salt Lake City, Utah.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Unless you\'re coming from Sandy, the most common way to get to Big Cottonwood Canyon is to get on the I-215 WB Belt Loop and follow the signs for the Cottonwood Canyons Ski resorts. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;At Knudsons Corner, take the 6200 S exit- EXIT 6- toward SKI AREAS/Solitude / Brighton/Snowbird / Alta for 0.2 miles. Merge onto UT-190 E toward SKI AREAS/Solitude / Brighton/Snowbird / Alta and drive for 1.8 miles to the mouth of Big Cottonwood Canyon, which is at Fort Union Blvd &amp;amp; Wasatch Blvd.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;At the mouth of the canyon is a Park\'N Ride. This is a popular place for recreationists to meet up &amp;amp; carpool up the canyon or begin bike rides up the canyon. In the winter, this is the hub for the ski buses, that run from the city up to the Ski Resorts.&lt;br&gt;&lt;a name=\"three\"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;font color=\"blue\"&gt;&lt;u&gt;By Bus:&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br&gt;The mouth of the canyon can be accessed by &lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://www.rideuta.com/Default.aspx\"&gt;UTA&lt;/a&gt; mass transit. In the winter, you can get on a ski bus to go up to the ski resorts, although to get to the crags, you\'ll either need a friend with a car or bring a bike (most of the climbing is a short bike ride up the canyon). Depending on where you\'re starting, you can get there using a combination of bus and &lt;a href=\"http://www.rideuta.com/schedulesAndMaps/routeSchedules/?routeGroupID=0\"&gt;TRAX&lt;/a&gt;, the metro area\'s light rail. UTA\'s website has a good &lt;a href=\"http://www.rideuta.com/schedulesAndMaps/tripPlanner/\"&gt;Trip Planner&lt;/a&gt; for figuring out your schedule.&lt;br&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_3\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Climbing Areas Overview&lt;/h2&gt;As you head up the canyon, there are a scattered collection of crags high up on the left side of the road. Beginning at the Dogwood Picnic Area, there is a large concentration of routes along the cliff that drops into Big Cottonwood Canyon Creek on the south side of the road. Next is the epicenter of climbing in Big Cottonwood Canyon, a huge number of walls and aretes surrounding the Storm Mountain Picnic area and reaching up into Mule Hollow and Tanners Gulch. Above this there is more climbing to had in some gulleys and buttresses on the north side of the canyon until you reach the highest point with much climbing potential in the canyon - the S-Curve. There are a number of climbing areas here, as well as Millstone Slab and alpine routes on Sundial Peak up Mill B South Fork, and some remote but high quality climbing areas far up Mill B North Fork.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The climbing areas are described in the order in which they are reached, heading up the canyon. Only areas listed under the route section are covered here - there are many more yet to climb!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://www.summitpost.org/show/route_link.pl/route_id/5562/object_id/4933\"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Dogwood Crag:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;This climbing area features many single pitch climbs on a wall rising out of (or nearly out of) Big Cottonwood Canyon Stream. It is 0.95 miles up the canyon and is next to a picnic area, which can be nice for having a mid-climb or post-climb picnic.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://www.summitpost.org/show/route_link.pl/route_id/5568/object_id/4933\"&gt;&lt;b&gt;JHCOB Wall:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;The next five areas are within a short distance of each other (2.25 mi-2.7 mi) and you can really walk from one to the other. JHCOB Wall (sometimes called Jacob Wall) is a giant wall/arete that towers some 300 ft above the Big Cottonwood Canyon road. It offers many nice multipitch trad routes. The acronym stands for: Jesus H. Christ on a Bicycle.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://www.summitpost.org/show/route_link.pl/route_id/5558/object_id/4933\"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Salt Lake Slips:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;Located across the river just up the road from JHCOB Wall. A fun tyrolean traverse is needed to cross the river, especially in the spring. This area has a number of sport climbs on a shaded wall.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://www.summitpost.org/show/route_link.pl/route_id/5808/object_id/4933\"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Narcolepsy Area:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;This shady crag is the next one up the canyon from JHCOB wall on the south side of the road. It features a number of crack climbs and some good steep sport routes, all of which can be top-roped. A somewhat \'lengthy\' approach keeps this climbing area a little more empty than the surrounding areas.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://www.summitpost.org/show/route_link.pl/route_id/5580/object_id/4933\"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Storm Mountain Island:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;This area is accessed via Storm Mountain Picnic Ground. It has a variety of routes, ranging from easy routes to desperate overhangs. There are some aid routes as well as some short multipitch routes on the island.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://www.summitpost.org/show/route_link.pl/route_id/5578/object_id/4933\"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Static Wall &amp;amp; Reservoir Alcove:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;These are accessed via Storm Mountain Picnic Ground across an open field from the Storm Mountain Island. They have some pumpy sport routes, some easy sport routes, and a trad ridge climb that is good for beginning leaders.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://www.summitpost.org/show/route_link.pl/route_id/5588/object_id/4933\"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Dead Snag:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;This intimidating wall is a short ways up Stairs Gulch (which is right across the road from the Storm Mountain Picnic Ground) and beneath the mighty NE face of Storm Mountain.  There are many moderately difficult and steep multipitch trad routes that ascend this wall, and several rapells are needed to descend all of them.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://www.summitpost.org/show/route_link.pl/route_id/5561/object_id/4933\"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Millstone Slab:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;This is the first large slab on your right as you hike up Mill Fork B from the S-Curve. There is a II-III 5.3 climb up the slab, as well as many vertical and overhanging sport routes along the wall of the slab on the south side.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a name=\"four\"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_4\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Summits Overview&lt;/h2&gt;The following are a list of summits than can be climbed directly from Big Cottonwood Canyon or one of its tributaries, listed in order of the trailheads reached.&lt;ul&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://www.summitpost.org/mountains/mountain_link.pl?mountain_id=3238\"&gt;Storm Mountain&lt;/a&gt; - 9,524 ft&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://www.summitpost.org/show/mountain_link.pl/mountain_id/390\"&gt;Broads Fork Twin Peaks&lt;/a&gt; - 11,330 ft&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://www.summitpost.org/show/mountain_link.pl/mountain_id/1401\"&gt;Sunrise Peak&lt;/a&gt; - 11,275 ft&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://www.summitpost.org/show/mountain_link.pl/mountain_id/92\"&gt;Mt Dromedary&lt;/a&gt; - 11,107 ft&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://www.summitpost.org/show/mountain_link.pl/mountain_id/1405\"&gt;Sundial Pk&lt;/a&gt; - 10,320 ft&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://www.summitpost.org/show/mountain_link.pl/mountain_id/1426\"&gt;Mt Superior &amp;amp; Monte Cristo&lt;/a&gt; - 11,040 ft &amp;amp; 11,132 ft&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://www.summitpost.org/show/mountain_link.pl/mountain_id/2354\"&gt;Mt Raymond&lt;/a&gt; - 10,241 ft&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://www.summitpost.org/show/mountain_link.pl/mountain_id/2688\"&gt;Gobblers Knob&lt;/a&gt; - 10,246 ft&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://www.summitpost.org/show/mountain_link.pl/mountain_id/4208\"&gt;Reynolds Peak&lt;/a&gt; - 9,422 ft&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://www.summitpost.org/show/mountain_link.pl/mountain_id/4207\"&gt;Little Water Peak&lt;/a&gt; - 9,605 ft&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://www.summitpost.org/show/mountain_link.pl/mountain_id/3269\"&gt;Kessler Peak&lt;/a&gt; - 10,403 ft&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://www.summitpost.org/show/mountain_link.pl/mountain_id/3715\"&gt;Flagstaff Mountain&lt;/a&gt; - 10,530 ft&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://www.summitpost.org/show/mountain_link.pl/mountain_id/3377\"&gt;Honeycomb Cliffs&lt;/a&gt; - 10,480 ft&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://www.summitpost.org/show/mountain_link.pl/mountain_id/3378\"&gt;Mount Millicent&lt;/a&gt; - 10,452 ft&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://www.summitpost.org/show/mountain_link.pl/mountain_id/3379\"&gt;Mount Wolverine &amp;amp; Mt Tuscarora&lt;/a&gt; - 10,640 ft &amp;amp; 10,795 ft&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://www.summitpost.org/show/mountain_link.pl/mountain_id/3376\"&gt;Sunset Peak&lt;/a&gt; - 10,648 ft&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://www.summitpost.org/show/mountain_link.pl/mountain_id/3374\"&gt;Pioneer Peak&lt;/a&gt; - 10,450 ft&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://www.summitpost.org/show/mountain_link.pl/mountain_id/3375\"&gt;Mt Majestic (Claton Peak)&lt;/a&gt; - 10,721 ft&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br&gt;If there are peaks that need to be added or are in improper order, please let me know!&lt;br&gt;&lt;a name=\"five\"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_5\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Page &amp;amp; Route Format&lt;/h2&gt;Since there are so many short climbs in this canyon, I\'ve grouped them together by the main rock feature ascended. In some cases I\'ve grouped several features onto one route. The routes begin with a listing of all climbs in the area, their difficulty, quality (out of 3 stars), and FA. Route overview information is used from Stuart &amp;amp; Bret Ruckman\'s &lt;a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0762727306/summitpost-20/103-3515982-7251006\"&gt;Rock Climbing the Wasatch Range&lt;/a&gt; to give people a general idea of what\'s out there. Alterations to climbing quality ratings, and in depth route descriptions are included only for the routes I\'ve climbed (sorry, but if you want the info for the other routes, you\'d better get the guidebook!)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Many of the climbing areas are still not listed on the page - I\'m only putting them up after I\'ve climbed at least one route in the area.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If you\'ve done a climb in the areas listed as routes, feel free to add info for an existing climb or for an unclimbed route, and I\'ll integrate it into the page. If you\'ve climbed in a region not listed, feel free to put up a route page for it, but please try to stick with the general format for this page to maintain continuity. &lt;br&gt;&lt;a name=\"six\"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_6\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Red Tape&lt;/h2&gt;Big Cottonwood Canyon is part of the Salt Lake City Watershed. As a result no dogs are allowed. Many of the side canyons are in the Mount Olympus and Broads Fork Twins Wilderness Areas. Regulations for these wilderness areas are as follows:&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Camp at least 100 ft from the trail and 200 ft from any water source&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Do not defecate or urinate within 200 ft of any water source&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Do not swim in any of the reservoirs&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;No dogs or horses&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Parties limited to 9 people&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br&gt;Apart from these restrictions, no permits are needed to enter or camp in the wilderness areas.&lt;br&gt;&lt;a name=\"seven\"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_7\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;When To Climb&lt;/h2&gt;Usually the rock routes are in prime climbing conditions beginning in April and lasting until late October.  During Salt Lake\'s regular warm thaws throughout the winter, the lower routes often melt out enough to allow climbing in the middle of the winter!  During the winter there are also a number of mixed WI routes in the canyon, so climbing can be done year-round.&lt;br&gt;&lt;a name=\"eight\"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_8\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Mountain Conditions&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;a name=\"iframe\"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;ul style=\"list-style-type:none;\"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;For the 7-day forecast, click &lt;a href=\"http://ifps.wrh.noaa.gov/cgi-bin/dwf?outFormat=table&amp;amp;duration=168hr&amp;amp;interval=6&amp;amp;citylist=Select%2BCity%2C%2Cnone&amp;amp;latitude=&amp;amp;longitude=&amp;amp;ZOOMLEVEL=8&amp;amp;XSTART=235&amp;amp;YSTART=347&amp;amp;XC=261&amp;amp;YC=380&amp;amp;X=261&amp;amp;Y=380&amp;amp;siteID=SLC&amp;amp;click.x=202&amp;amp;click.y=263\"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;div style=\"overflow:hidden;width:527px;height:465px;\"&gt;&lt;iframe src=\"http://ifps.wrh.noaa.gov/cgi-bin/dwf?outFormat=table&amp;amp;duration=72hr&amp;amp;interval=6&amp;amp;citylist=Select+City,,none&amp;amp;latitude=&amp;amp;longitude=&amp;amp;ZOOMLEVEL=8&amp;amp;XSTART=235&amp;amp;YSTART=346&amp;amp;XC=261&amp;amp;YC=379&amp;amp;X=261&amp;amp;Y=379&amp;amp;siteID=SLC&amp;amp;click.x=220&amp;amp;click.y=252\" style=\"position:relative;left:-138px;top:-160px;width:650px;height:1820px;\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"&gt;&lt;br&gt;[Your user agent does not support frames or is currently configured&lt;br&gt;not to display frames.

Collectively these three canyons are known as the tri-canyon areas (Millcreek Canyon, Big Cottonwood Canyon, &amp;amp; Little Cottonwood Canyon), with the Cottonwood Canyons being popular for a multitude of activities such as cycling, hiking, snowshoeing, picnicking, backcountry skiing, fishing, mountaineering, and ice and rock climbing. &lt;a href=\"http://www.snowbird.com/\"&gt;Snowbird&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"http://www.alta.com/\"&gt;Alta&lt;/a&gt; ski resorts, which often receive around 500 inches of dry powdery snow each season, are also located at the top of the canyon and are accessible via public transit. During the summer months you can enjoy a tram ride, festivals, and music concerts at Snowbird. The backcountry skiing areas here are world renown (especially in the Lone Peak and Broads Fork Wilderness Areas), although Powderbird&rsquo;s helicopter skiing services have been an issue of contention among skiers, the ski industry, and environmentalists. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;During the mid-1800s, miners sought their fortune in gold and silver in this canyon, and remnants of the old mines can still be found in the upper parts of canyon, especially around the Albion Basin Area above Alta. In fact, the town of Alta started as a mining boomtown, and was often ravaged by avalanches coming off of the Wasatch peaks, which occasionally destroyed the entire town. In its mining heyday, Alta was a violent town, considered by the Mormons in the Salt Lake Valley to be riddled in sin. Although, I&rsquo;m not certain if this is entirely correct, I remember hearing that Hell Gate Cliffs, which are passed just before reaching Alta, were named as such because the cliffs marked the gateway to hell (i.e. Alta). During WWII Alta was a premier training ground for the 10th Mountain Division, which later served the US in military combat in Europe&rsquo;s more extreme mountain environments. After the war, Alta became an important testing ground for studying avalanches, and many contributions to the forecasting and control work of avalanches came from here.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Ancient glaciers carved the spectacular vistas of the 8-mile long canyon, which is obvious upon seeing the huge U-shape of the canyon. The tributary gulches to the south were also glacially carved, leaving many rugged mountain cirques, although the main canyon was carved in such a way that most of these gulches are very inaccessible from the main canyon, and must be approached by climbing over mountain passes. It enjoys a prime location near the Great Salt Lake and the southern end of the Salt Lake Valley, bounded by smaller foothills. The combination of lake effect and the directing shape of the southern end of the Salt Lake Valley funnels much of Utah&rsquo;s winter storms directly up Little Cottonwood Canyon, which is why the resorts here usually see much more snow than Utah&rsquo;s other ski resorts.  The canyon is also one of the most avalanche prone canyons in North America, as is evident by the many avalanche slide area signs passed while driving up the canyon. There are some 30 avalanche paths that can reach the highway, and over 300 known major slide paths in the entire canyon complex. Because of this, during big winter snowstorms, UDOT often cannot keep the road safe, and it is occasionally closed until proper avalanche control can be completed (often stranding skiers up the canyon!).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Although this canyon is only a few miles south of Big Cottonwood Canyon, the rock here is completely different. Friction face climbing and crack climbing predominate here on coarse and polished granite. As such, the routes often rise at a kinder angle, although in general the climbing here is more difficult. There aren&rsquo;t as many opportunities to top-rope here, as most of the climbing routes are multi-pitch. The valley bottom has open forests with many granite boulders that are popular for bouldering, especially during the midday summer head.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Higher up the canyon there are climbing areas on limestone on Hell Gate Cliffs and Devil&rsquo;s Castle. There are also a number of alpine routes up Hogum Fork, and on White Baldy and the Pfeifferhorn, although the granite at the higher elevations has weathered in such a way that it is fairly loose and broken, especially when compared to the large expanses of unbroken granite lower down in the canyon. In the winter these gulches are premier areas for ski mountaineering, and many extreme routes can be found in the couloirs and bowls here. Some examples are the South Face of Mt Superior, The Pfeifferhorn&rsquo;s North Ridge and NW Couloir, N Thunder Mountn&rsquo;s Y-Couloir, and Lone Peak&rsquo;s east face.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The majority of climbing areas are found within the first two miles on the north side of the Canyon. The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints (LDS) owns property all along the road at the base of the cliffs, and No Trespassing signs are posted. However, Ted Wilson and Rick Reese, representing the climbing community, have brokered a compromise with the LDS Church allowing climbers to cross this property to reach the crags. Please respect the fact that this is private property, and do your part to minimize the climber&rsquo;s impact on the area. The Wasatch Resort on the south side of the road also makes access difficult to the routes on the south side of the canyon, but no official compromise has yet been made with the resort for approach access.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;While there are many possible routes in the canyon, most of the routes listed in guidebooks are within a 15-minute hike from the road. Due to the laziness of local craggers, there are many unrecorded and unclimbed routes on the cliffs higher up the steep canyon walls.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;On days off, there is a shaded old dirt road ascending the bottom of the canyon that is popular for hiking, jogging, and mountain biking. It can also be used for some approaches on the south side of the canyon.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;One final note is the ice climbing in the canyon. The areas around Scruffy Band at the mouth of the canyon often offer intermediate to advanced ice climbing conditions. Near Coalpit Gulch, the Great White Icicle offers a great 5-pitch WI 3 route that is almost always &lsquo;in&rsquo;, and it is one of the most popular ice climbing routes in the Wasatch. In the summer the waterfall that forms this climb is also descended as a 3C II canyoneering route.  In the winter the sun often melts off the granite on the north slopes, so climbing can often be found here year-round. In fact, it&rsquo;s entirely possible to go rock climbing, ice climbing, and skiing here all in the same day!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a name=\"two\"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;table class=\"inline_image_thumbs\"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=113853\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/113853.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=113841\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/113841.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=113843\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/113843.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=113844\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/113844.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=113849\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/113849.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_2\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Getting There&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;font color=\"blue\"&gt;&lt;u&gt;By Car&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/font&gt;:&lt;br&gt;Little Cottonwood Canyon is located at the intersection of Highway 210 and S Little Cottonwood Canyon Rd about  miles southeast of downtown Salt Lake City, Utah.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Unless you\'re coming from Sandy, the most common way to get to Little Cottonwood Canyon is to get on the I-215 WB Belt Loop and follow the signs for the Cottonwood Canyons Ski resorts. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;At Knudsons Corner, take the 6200 S exit- EXIT 6- toward SKI AREAS/Solitude / Brighton/Snowbird / Alta for 0.2 miles. Merge onto UT-190 E toward SKI AREAS/Solitude / Brighton/Snowbird / Alta and drive for 1.8 miles to the mouth of Big Cottonwood Canyon, which is at Fort Union Blvd &amp;amp; Wasatch Blvd. Continue straight through the stoplight and follow the road another 4 miles to the mouth of Little Cottonwood Canyon, where an electronic billboard on the right provides current road and/or weather conditions. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;At the mouth of the canyon is a Park\'N Ride. This is a popular place for recreationists to meet up &amp;amp; carpool up the canyon or begin bike rides up the canyon. In the winter, this is the hub for the ski buses, that run from the city up to the Ski Resorts. At the Park\'N Ride you are treated to a wonderful view of the mouth of Little Cottonwood Canyon, with some of the crags right above the parking lot, and some dramatic granite ribs and ice-covered cliffs (in winter) on the other side. There is even a telescope by the bus stop for viewing mountain goats that frequent the area.&lt;br&gt;&lt;a name=\"three\"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;font color=\"blue\"&gt;&lt;u&gt;By Bus:&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br&gt;The mouth of the canyon can be accessed by &lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://www.rideuta.com/Default.aspx\"&gt;UTA&lt;/a&gt; mass transit. In the winter, you can get on a ski bus to go up to the ski resorts, although to get to the crags, you\'ll either need a friend with a car or bring a bike (most of the climbing is a short bike ride up the canyon). Depending on where you\'re starting, you can get there using a combination of bus and &lt;a href=\"http://www.rideuta.com/schedulesAndMaps/routeSchedules/?routeGroupID=0\"&gt;TRAX&lt;/a&gt;, the metro area\'s light rail. UTA\'s website has a good &lt;a href=\"http://www.rideuta.com/schedulesAndMaps/tripPlanner/\"&gt;Trip Planner&lt;/a&gt; for figuring out your schedule.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a name=\"%E2%80%9Dthree%E2%80%9D\"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;table class=\"inline_image_thumbs\"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=113840\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/113840.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=113846\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/113846.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=113847\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/113847.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=113854\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/113854.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_3\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Climbing Areas Overview&lt;/h2&gt;From the Park N&rsquo;Ride you can already see numerous climbing routes in the canyon &ndash; a myriad of large bolders and outcroppings high up on the north slopes, and a series of large ribs and slabs lining the south side of the canyon. As you drive up the canyon, most of the climbing is found on the north slopes on your left, as is evident by the many cars usually filling the pullouts and shoulders along this area. Some areas of note along here are the Thumb, which is obvious from the road, and Gate and Black Peeler Buttresses. On the right high up the canyon is a huge ridge with a daunting east face &ndash; this is Perla&rsquo;s Ridge. At the Power Plant pullout most of the climbing is found on the south side of the canyon near Coalpit Gulch in areas such as Penta Pitch and the Great White Icicle. Beyond this, climbing potential withers, with Lisa Falls being one of the higher popular spots. Next there are some routes up Tanners Gulch on the north side of the Canyon, the Tanners Flat TH which is used for approaches to alpine climbs on Thunder Mtn, The Pfeifferhorn, and White Baldy. Finally, the granite is replaced with limestone, and good climbing areas re-appear along the road as you pass Hell Gate Cliffs on the north side of the canyon. At the end of the paved road, Albion basin has a smattering of climbing areas, with &lt;a href=\"http://www.summitpost.org/show/mountain_link.pl/mountain_id/1402\"&gt;Devil&rsquo;s Castle&lt;/a&gt; obviously containing a few alpine routes.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The climbing areas are described in the order in which they are reached, heading up the canyon. Only those sections listed under the &lsquo;routes&rsquo; section are covered here &ndash; there are still many more areas to climb!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://www.summitpost.org/show/route_link.pl/route_id/5825/object_id/5136\"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Lisa Falls:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;Lisa Falls is found 2.8 miles up the canyon at the mouth of a steep gorge that empties off of the Broads Fork Twin Peaks, on the north side of the road. It is a short ways up a trail, and offers many routes for top-roping and leading on granite slabs with a waterfall pouring through. If you follow the stream up, you can eventually reach the summit of the Broads Fork Twin Peaks via routes such as &lt;a href=\"%E2%80%9Dhttp://www.summitpost.org/mountains/route_link.pl?route_id=2769&amp;amp;object_id=390%E2%80%9D\"&gt;Lisa Falls Direct&lt;/a&gt;.

In some cases I\'ve grouped several features onto one route. The routes begin with a listing of all climbs in the area, their difficulty, quality (out of 3 stars), and FA. Route overview information is used from Stuart &amp;amp; Bret Ruckman\'s &lt;a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0762727306/summitpost-20/103-3515982-7251006\"&gt;Rock Climbing the Wasatch Range&lt;/a&gt; to give people a general idea of what\'s out there. Alterations to climbing quality ratings, and in depth route descriptions are included only for the routes I\'ve climbed (sorry, but if you want the info for the other routes, you\'d better get the guidebook!)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Many of the climbing areas are still not listed on the page - I\'m only putting them up after I\'ve climbed at least one route in the area.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If you\'ve done a climb in the areas listed as routes, feel free to add info for an existing climb or for an unclimbed route, and I\'ll integrate it into the page. If you\'ve climbed in a region not listed, feel free to put up a route page for it, but please try to stick with the general format for this page to maintain continuity. &lt;br&gt;&lt;a name=\"six\"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_6\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Red Tape&lt;/h2&gt;Little Cottonwood Canyon is part of the Salt Lake City Watershed. As a result no dogs are allowed. Many of the side canyons are in the Lone Peak and Broads Fork Twins Wilderness Areas. Regulations for these wilderness areas are as follows:&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Camp at least 100 ft from the trail and 200 ft from any water source&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Do not defecate or urinate within 200 ft of any water source&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Do not swim in any of the reservoirs&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;No dogs or horses&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Parties limited to 9 people&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br&gt;Apart from these restrictions, no permits are needed to enter or camp in the wilderness areas.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Many of the climbs are on private property or cross private property to access them. Please be respectful of the owners and the land you are accessing.&lt;br&gt;&lt;a name=\"seven\"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_7\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;When To Climb&lt;/h2&gt;Usually the rock routes are in prime climbing conditions beginning in April and lasting until late October.  During Salt Lake\'s regular warm thaws throughout the winter, the lower routes often melt out enough to allow climbing in the middle of the winter!  During the winter the Scruffy Band and some of the other cliffs on the north-facing slopes accumulate enough ice for some good water ice climbing. The most popular route, which is almost always &lsquo;in&rsquo;, is the Great White Icicle, which is near Coalpit Gulch and the Pentapitch Area.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In the summer the routes on the large south-facing granite slabs get very bright and very hot &ndash; be careful about getting caught on a multi-pitch climb there in the middle of summer, when temperatures can exceed 100&lt;sup&gt;o&lt;/sup&gt;F and there&rsquo;s no shade in sight! Getting your toes burned from heated climbing shoe soles is not very fun &lt;img src=\"%E2%80%9D/\" message_board width=\"15\" height=\"15\"&gt;.  Fall is usually considered the best time overall for climbing in the canyon.&lt;br&gt;&lt;a name=\"eight\"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_8\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Mountain Conditions&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;a name=\"iframe\"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;ul style=\"list-style-type:none;\"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;For the 7-day forecast, click &lt;a href=\"http://ifps.wrh.noaa.gov/cgi-bin/dwf?outFormat=table&amp;amp;duration=168hr&amp;amp;interval=6&amp;amp;citylist=Select%2BCity%2C%2Cnone&amp;amp;latitude=&amp;amp;longitude=&amp;amp;ZOOMLEVEL=8&amp;amp;XSTART=235&amp;amp;YSTART=347&amp;amp;XC=261&amp;amp;YC=380&amp;amp;X=261&amp;amp;Y=380&amp;amp;siteID=SLC&amp;amp;click.x=202&amp;amp;click.y=263\"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;div style=\"overflow:hidden;width:527px;height:465px;\"&gt;&lt;iframe src=\"http://ifps.wrh.noaa.gov/cgi-bin/dwf?outFormat=table&amp;amp;duration=72hr&amp;amp;interval=6&amp;amp;citylist=Select+City,,none&amp;amp;latitude=&amp;amp;longitude=&amp;amp;ZOOMLEVEL=8&amp;amp;XSTART=235&amp;amp;YSTART=346&amp;amp;XC=261&amp;amp;YC=379&amp;amp;X=261&amp;amp;Y=379&amp;amp;siteID=SLC&amp;amp;click.x=220&amp;amp;click.y=252\" style=\"position:relative;left:-138px;top:-160px;width:650px;height:1820px;\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"&gt;&lt;br&gt;[Your user agent does not support frames or is currently configured&lt;br&gt;not to display frames.

There is not even a snow crowned subject in sight of its dominion. A shining pyramid in everlasting mail of frosts and ice, the sailor sometimes, in a day of singular clearness, catches glimpses of it from the sea a hundred miles away to the west; and it may be seen from the dome of the capitol 340 miles distant. The immigrant coming from the east beholds the snowy, solitary pillar from afar out on the arid sage-brush plains, and lifts his hands in silence as if in answer to a sign.&lt;/i&gt;\"&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;- Joaquin Miller, &lt;i&gt;Life Amongst The Modocs&lt;/i&gt;, 1874&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://www.summitpost.org/view_object.php?object_id=463170\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"http://www.summitpost.org/images/medium/463170.jpg\"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br clear=\"ALL\"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_2\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Mount Shasta Overview&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;div align=\"center\" class=\"image-right\" style=\"width: 506px;\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"/mount-shasta/464183\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Mount Shasta\" height=\"331\" width=\"500\" src=\"/images/medium/464183.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=\"caption\"&gt;Mount Shasta viewed from the Squaw Creek Valley&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br&gt;Majestic and solitary, Mount Shasta is the undisputed monarch of northern California.  The magnificent cone soars more than 5,000 feet above its tallest neighbor and more than 10,000 feet above its base elevation.  Mount Shasta is the superlative mountain in a state of superlatives.  Cloaked in glaciers and boasting epic displays of lenticular cloud formations, the stratovolcano is one of the grandest summits in the American West.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Mount Shasta is the second highest peak in the Cascade Range, surpassed only by Mount Rainier which is just 249 feet taller.  Nonetheless, with a base diameter of more than 17 miles, Mount Shasta has the greater volume.  The mountain is one of the southernmost volcanoes in the Cascades, with only Lassen Peak further south.  Shastina, Mount Shasta\'s largest subordinate peak, is the third highest summit in the range.  Shasta is also one of the youngest of the Cascade\'s major volcanoes.  This is visible in the mountain\'s pointed, conical cap.  Other major peaks like Mounts Rainier, Adams and Hood are older and have broader, more rounded summits.  The last eruption occured in 1786; the sulphur springs near the top of Mount Shasta give warning that the mountain will reawaken in the future.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Although Mount Shasta is a formidable mountain, it offers recreational opportunities to people of all abilities.  Whether one seeks extreme, multi-day treks up massive glaciers or peaceful hikes through lush meadows, it is found on Shasta.  From skiing to backpacking, waterfalls to wildflowers, Mount Shasta has it all and is a world unto itself.&lt;br clear=\"ALL\"&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_3\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Mount Shasta Wilderness&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;div align=\"center\" class=\"image-left\" style=\"width: 506px;\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"/mount-shasta/813951\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Mount Shasta\" height=\"333\" width=\"500\" src=\"/images/medium/813951.JPG\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=\"caption\"&gt;Ash Creek Falls in the Mount Shasta Wilderness&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;\"The Shasta region is still a fresh unspoiled wilderness, accessible and available for travelers of every kind and degree.  Would it not be a fine thing to set it apart like the Yellowstone and Yosemite as a National Park for the welfare and benefit of all mankind, preserving its fountains and forests and all its glad life in primeval beauty?\"&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;- John Muir, &lt;i&gt;\"Picturesque California\"&lt;/i&gt;, 1888&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;John Muir\'s vision of a Mount Shasta National Park never came to fruition and many trees in the region and even on the slopes of the mountain itself fell to the loggers axe.  Nonetheless, at least an aspect of his dream was realized with the creation of the Mount Shasta Wilderness.  The upper portions of the mountain are contained within the wilderness area, which was established by the 1984 California Wilderness Act.  It currently encompasses 38,200 acres.  The preserve is one of six protected wild regions in the California Cascades.  It is the third largest, behind the Lassen Volcanic and Ishi Wilderness areas and ahead of the Caribou, Lava Beds and Thousand Lakes Wilderness areas.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Nearly 7,000 feet of Mount Shasta&rsquo;s height is above the timberline.  Consequently, this is among the most barren wilderness areas in northern California.  The lushest forest within the boundary is found on the northeast and southeast slopes of the mountain.  Glaciers, tundra and massive screefields dominate the rest of the area, although small meadows punctuate the lower flanks of Mount Shasta.  The wilderness area also contains several lava flows, most of which are found on the north side of the mountain.  The newest flows are in the northwest, nearest the Bolam trailhead.  Older flows can be observed in the North Gate area.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Most of the prominent features on the mountain fall within the wilderness boundary, including important subordinate peaks, Shastina, Red Butte and Shastarama Point.   Notable exceptions to this are Green Butte and Gray Butte.  The latter is accessible by a rough 4x4 road as well as by trail.  Green Butte, on the other hand is, is well above the nearest road and it is unclear why the wilderness boundary was drawn around it.  Four named waterfalls; Whitney, Coquette, Mud Creek and Ash Creek are also found within the wilderness, though only Whitney Falls has a (rarely) maintained trail leading to it.  All other waterfalls require off trail hiking to view them.  &lt;br clear=\"ALL\"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_4\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Climbing Mount Shasta&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;div align=\"center\" class=\"image-left\" style=\"width: 506px;\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"/green-butte-ridge/799782\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Green Butte Ridge\" height=\"375\" width=\"500\" src=\"/images/medium/799782.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=\"caption\"&gt;Climbing Green Butte Ridge&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br&gt;Over 15,000 summit attempts are made every year, only a third of which are successful. Avalanche Gulch is the least difficult and most popular route, and many people with no mountaineering experience are able to climb it (many more such people are not). An ice axe and crampons are necessary for all routes. One-day ascents are possible, but beginners will want to take two days so they can have more time to acclimatize. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;font color=\"Red\"&gt;Avalanches and rapidly changing weather conditions make winter climbs more dangerous, however rock fall is a threat year round.

Continue to the trailhead at the end of the road (about 8 miles from Pilgrim Creek Road and 13 miles from Highway 89).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;table border=\"1\" bordercolor=\"#FFFFFF\" bgcolor=\"#DDDDDD\" cellpadding=\"5\" cellspacing=\"0\"&gt;&lt;tr bgcolor=\"#444444\"&gt;&lt;th&gt;&lt;font color=\"#FFFFFF\"&gt;Route&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/th&gt;&lt;th&gt;&lt;font color=\"#FFFFFF\"&gt;Trailhead (alternate)&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/th&gt;&lt;th&gt;&lt;font color=\"#FFFFFF\"&gt;Grade&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/th&gt;&lt;th&gt;&lt;font color=\"#FFFFFF\"&gt;Elevation Gain&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/th&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://www.summitpost.org/clear-creek/157378\"&gt;Clear Creek&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Clear Creek&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;I&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;7600 Feet&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://www.summitpost.org/wintun-ridge/160128\"&gt;Wintun Ridge&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Clear Creek&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;I&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;7600 Feet&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;b&gt;Wintun Glacier&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Clear Creek (Brewer Creek)&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;III&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;7600 Feet&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://www.shastaavalanche.org/eastside.htm\"&gt; &lt;font color=\"blue\"&gt;&lt;b&gt;East Side GIS Image&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://s17.photobucket.com/albums/b94/vanderbubba/SP%20Maps/?action=view%C2%A4t=ShastaERoutes.jpg\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"http://i17.photobucket.com/albums/b94/vanderbubba/SP%20Maps/ShastaERoutes.jpg\" border=\"0\" width=\"400\" alt=\"Photobucket\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_7\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;North/Northeast Route Information&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;div align=\"center\" class=\"image-right\" style=\"width: 494px;\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"/crossing-crevasses-on-hotlum/60925\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Crossing crevasses on Hotlum...\" height=\"650\" width=\"488\" src=\"/images/original/60925.JPG\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=\"caption\"&gt;Crevasses on the Hotlum Glacier&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Brewer Creek Trailhead&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Brewer Creek is reached by taking US 97 north from Weed. 12 miles after Weed, turn right on Forest Service Road 19. Go more than 10 miles down this road, where you join with Forest Service Road 31 for a short period. Then, go right onto Road 42N02. After around 2.5 miles turn left onto 42N10, and take this to the trailhead at the end.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;North Gate Trailhead&lt;/b&gt; (41.46840&deg; N, 122.17401&deg; W)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;From Interstate 5 in Weed head northeast on Highway 97 for 15 miles until reaching Military Pass Road. Follow Military Pass Road for 3.6 miles to a junction with Andesite Logging Road and bear right as indicated by road signs. Continue on Andesite Logging Road for approximately five miles passing several forks and junctions en route to the trailhead. The drive is well signed from Military Pass Road and drivers should have no issue navigating the route (other than the rough terrain and possible bump of the oil pan).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Coquette Falls&lt;/b&gt; (41.45841&deg; N, 122.21615&deg; W)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;From Interstate 5 in Weed head northeast on Highway 97 for 12 miles until reaching Bolam Road (aka Forest Service Road 4321). On Bolam Road keep right at 0.3 miles and cross over railroad tracks 1.7 miles from Highway 97. Turn left 2.3 miles from Highway 97 onto Bolam Logging Road. Follow the main road here as various spurs are passed. The road splits into 2-3 forks after about 4 miles, soon coming back together (none of choices are very good&hellip; quite brushy here). Keep right at junctions 4.8 and 5.1 miles from Highway 97. Continue on the sometimes rough, sometimes not, logging road keeping left at 6.7 miles, right at 7.1 miles, left at 7.5 miles, and right at 7.7 miles from the highway.

All the established trails are of the out-and-back variety.  Only the Red Butte route providing a loop of sorts.  The trails on the south side offer the most diverse destinations and are easiest to get to.  Those on the north provide some of the best vistas of the mountain.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_11\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h3&gt;South Side Trailheads&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;font color=\"Blue\"&gt;Hiking trails marked in blue.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;font color=\"red\"&gt;Routes marked in red.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br&gt;Dotted lines note established off-trail routes.&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://s17.photobucket.com/albums/b94/vanderbubba/SP%20Maps/?action=view%C2%A4t=ShastaRoutesHiking-South.jpg\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"http://i17.photobucket.com/albums/b94/vanderbubba/SP%20Maps/ShastaRoutesHiking-South.jpg\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Photobucket\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Bunny Flat/Sand Flat Trailhead&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The trail to Horse Camp departs from here.  While Horse Camp is a worthy destination in its own right, route leading to Hidden Valley and Green Butte make excellent, day long hiking trips.  The maintained trail leads only as far as the Sierra Club hut.  Beyond there, only use trails lead to further destinations.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Panther Meadows Trailhead&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;While Panther Meadows itself is only a short distance from the trailhead, the trail continues to a number of destinations.  Gray Butte is the closest destination.  Squaw/South Gate Meadows is also accessed from here, as is the loop around Red Butte.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Old Ski Bowl Trailhead&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A connector trail leads from here to the route to Squaw/South Gate Meadows and Red Butte.  An unmaintained route to the top of Green Butte also begins here.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Clear Creek Trailhead&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Clear Creek trail departs here.  Most who hike this trail are heading up Mount Shasta via the Clear Creek route.  Nonetheless, this is a great trail for day hiking and offers great views of the mountain.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_12\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h3&gt;North Side Trailheads&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;font color=\"Blue\"&gt;Hiking trails marked in blue.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;font color=\"red\"&gt;Routes marked in red.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br&gt;Dotted lines note established off-trail routes.&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://s17.photobucket.com/albums/b94/vanderbubba/SP%20Maps/?action=view%C2%A4t=ShastaRoutesHiking-North.jpg\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"http://i17.photobucket.com/albums/b94/vanderbubba/SP%20Maps/ShastaRoutesHiking-North.jpg\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Photobucket\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Most of the trails on the northside of Mount Shasta are used primarily as access trails leading to routes to the summit.  While all the trails simply fade out as they gain elevation, they are still great hikes with wonderful views of the mountain.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Brewer Creek Trailhead&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This trail leads to the east side of the mountain and offers great views of the eastern glaciers.  An unmaintained route departing the trail near its terminus leads south to Ash Creek Falls, Mount Shasta\'s most spectacular waterfall.  The best vantage point for the falls is gained by crossing the creek above the falls and traversing around until the falls comes into view.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;North Gate Trailhead&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Again, the trail leads to route headed for the summit.

As you sweep around so grand a centre the mountain itself seems to turn... One glacier after another comes into view, and the outlines of the mountain are everchanging.\"&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;- John Muir, &lt;i&gt;\"Shasta Bees. A Honeyful Region - The Bee Lands - A Summer Paradise\"&lt;/i&gt;, 1874&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It is said that Muir preferred the trip around the Mount Shasta rather than up it.  This was due in part to the ever changing profile of the mountain and the vistas of the glaciers.  Today, few undertake this trailless endeavor.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A backpacking trip around the mountain would generally take three to four days to complete the roughly 35 miles.  Those who do make the trip generally stay around the treeline.  This makes travel easier and the views excellent.  Most trips begin and end at Horse Camp.  Major obstacles include the scree on the west side of the mountain near Shastina, crossing the foot of many glaciers (particularly the Whitney Glacier) and climbing into and out of Mud Creek Canyon.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Selters and Zanger\'s book on Mount Shasta includes and a description of the &lt;b&gt;approximate&lt;/b&gt; route.  A route page and more detail will be added to Summitpost this summer (2009).&lt;a name=\"chapter_14\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Camping&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;div align=\"center\" class=\"image-left\" style=\"width: 485px;\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"/shasta/716504\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Shasta\" height=\"720\" width=\"479\" src=\"/images/original/716504.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=\"caption\"&gt;Camp on Casaval Ridge&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br&gt;Trailhead camping is common and allowed at the Bunny Flat trailhead.  Dispersed camping is allowed throughout the greater Mount Shasta area, including at and en route to other trailheads.  Camping is also allowed at the Sierra Club maintained Horse Camp.  They charge $5.00 per tent and $3.00 per bivy.  This is a good basecamp for trips up many of the south side routes.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Forest Service maintains two campgrounds on Mount Shasta, both of which are located off of Everitt Memorial Highway.  McBride Springs Campground is only a couple miles outside of the town of Mount Shasta and has a lot of shade.  Panther Meadows Campground is located near 8,000 feet, just a bit below the Old Ski Bowl.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Other great campgrounds are found in the area, though not on Mount Shasta itself.  One such is Fowlers Camp, on the McCloud River.  This campground is located right along the river and the trail that connects the three McCloud River Waterfalls passes through it.  This is a good place to camp when accessing Mount Shasta trailheads on the east side of the mountain.  Other good campgrounds in the area include Castle Lake and Gumboot Lake, both of which are high in the mountains west of Mount Shasta but are only minutes from town.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Several of the attached route pages overview possible camping options for staying on the mountain.&lt;a name=\"chapter_15\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Geography&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;div align=\"center\" class=\"image-right\" style=\"width: 506px;\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"/mount-shasta/415898\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Mount Shasta\" height=\"333\" width=\"500\" src=\"/images/medium/415898.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=\"caption\"&gt;Mount Shasta from the Trinity Divide&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_16\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Regional Geography&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;br&gt;Mount Shasta is one the southern most volcanic peaks in the Cascade Range, which stretches from Canada to northern California.  Of the major volcanoes in the range, only Lassen Peak lies further south.  Oregon&rsquo;s Mount McLoughlin is the next prominent volcano in the chain.  Mount Shasta lies west of the main crest of the California Cascades (which is rather ill-defined).  The Klamath Mountains, which make up much of northwestern California, come within miles of Shasta.  The Strawberry Valley separates the massive Klamath Range from Shasta.  The range&rsquo;s highpoint, Mount Eddy, is only 16 miles away from the summit of Mount Shasta.  Considering Shasta&rsquo;s great diameter, the Klamath actual proximity to the volcano is much greater.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A number of volcanic cones are found immediately east of Mount Shasta.  Chief among these peaks are the Whaleback (8,528), Ash Creek Butte (8,378) and Haight Mountain (8,081).  Further east, the Medicine Lake Highlands rise out of the Modoc Plateau, reaching a maximum height of 7,913 on Mount Hoffman.  Despite these peaks&rsquo; respectable elevation, they are all well over 5,000 feet shorter than Mount Shasta.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;div align=\"center\" class=\"image-left\" style=\"width: 506px;\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"/mount-shasta/470204\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Mount Shasta\" height=\"333\" width=\"500\" src=\"/images/medium/470204.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=\"caption\"&gt;Mount Shasta and the Whaleback from Herd Peak&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br&gt;North of Mount Shasta, two large valleys spread all the way to the Oregon border.  The Cascade crest forms the divide between the two plains.  To the west is the Shasta Valley, through which flows the Shasta River, tributary of the Klamath River.  This is the larger of the two valleys.  The valley is within Mount Shasta&rsquo;s rainshadow.  This results in the valley&rsquo;s high desert climate.  Several tall knobs and domes are found throughout the area, particularly at the southern end of the valley.  These are remnants of a vast rock slide that poured off the northern flanks of Shasta at some point in the dim past.  Due to the arid conditions and poor soils, cattle raising is the largest industry in the Shasta Valley.  To the west of the Cascade crest is the Butte Valley.  Although smaller than Shasta Valley, Butte Valley is nearly 2,000 feet higher.  This results in a bit more precipitation and somewhat milder climate.  This allows for a more diversified economic base and agriculture is common in the Butte Valley, particularly the growing of strawberries.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Cascade crest north of Mount Shasta is one of the most forgotten regions in the entire range.  Containing no lakes and few creeks, the area is completely overshadowed by Mount Shasta (with good reason).  The best reason to explore this area is for the one thing that can&rsquo;t be found on Shasta itself; great views of the mountain.  Willow Creek Mountain (7,829), the Goosenest (8,280) and Herd Peak (7,071) are the highest peaks in the range.  The Goosenest is of particular note, beings a large cinder cone with a classic crater at its summit.  If this peak were in Oregon, it would be one of the state&rsquo;s major summits.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;div align=\"center\" class=\"image-right\" style=\"width: 506px;\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"/mount-shasta/363208\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Mount Shasta\" height=\"351\" width=\"500\" src=\"/images/medium/363208.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=\"caption\"&gt;Mount Shasta from the north.  Shastina is on the right, North Gate is the point on the left&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_17\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Mountain Topography&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;br&gt;Although Mount Shasta is a solitary mountain, many important features populate its flanks.  Some of these features would rank as major peaks in their own right if they did not fall under Shasta&rsquo;s overpowering shadow.  Canyons, waterfalls, points and glaciers are also found on Mount Shasta.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Shastina&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If Shastina were separated from Mount Shasta it would be the third highest peak in the Cascades at 12,330 feet.  The formation is a massive subordinate cone on Shasta&rsquo;s northwest flank.  A clearly discernable crater is found on the summit, which contains the small Clarence King Lake.  Equally small Sisson Lake is on Shastina&rsquo;s eastern flank, in the saddle between Shastina and Shasta.  The peak sees far less attention than its overwhelming neighbor, but is still a worthy destination in its own right.  Diller Canyon, on Shastina&rsquo;s western slope is a popular skiing route.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Shastarama Point&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Reaching a height of 11,195, Shastarama Point is one of the dominant features on Sargents Ridge.  The point is prominently visible from Mount Shasta City.  Mud Creek Glacier curls around the north side of the prominence.  Squaw / Southgate Meadows is one of the best locations to view this magnificent chunk of rock.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Green Butte&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Taken by itself, Green Butte would be the sixth highest peak in the California Cascades at 9,193 feet.  The peak is large prominence on the southern side of Mount Shasta.  Green Butte is the highest of a series of prominent points in the area, all of which carry colors as their monikers.  The peak rises directly above the Old Ski Bowl parking lot and can be reached by a non-maintained route that originates there.  It can also be reached via a cross-country route from Horse Camp.  Green Butte is a frequent target of lightening strikes.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Red Butte&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;At 8,377 feet, Red Butte is the second highest of the &ldquo;color buttes&rdquo; on Mount Shasta&rsquo;s southern flank.  The peak rises high above The Gate, a narrow, barren pass that leads to the lush Squaw / Southgate Meadows area.  An excellent cross-country spur off the trail leading to the meadow forms a loop around the base of Red Butte.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Gray Butte&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Gray Butte is the shortest of the &ldquo;color buttes&rdquo; reaching an elevation of 8,108.  The peak houses an array of antennas at its southern end, which is reached via a round.  A trail beginning at Panther Meadows also reaches the summit, which offers spectacular views of Mount Shasta.  The peak is outside the Mount Shasta Wilderness boundary.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;North Gate&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;North Gate is a large volcanic dome on the north side of Mount Shasta.  The Northgate trail winds near the 7,915 foot summit on its way to the climbing routes up the Bolam and Hotlum Glaciers.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mud Creek Canyon&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The largest chasm on Mount Shasta, Mud Creek Canyon is also one of the oldest features on the mountain.  Glaciers scoured it out during previous glacial periods.  The Mud Creek and Konwakiton Glaciers feed Mud Creek.  Mud Creek Falls is one of the four major waterfalls on Mount Shasta.  The Clear Creek Trail follows the canyon rim for nearly a mile.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;div align=\"center\" class=\"image-right\" style=\"width: 506px;\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"/mount-shasta/350145\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Mount Shasta\" height=\"333\" width=\"500\" src=\"/images/medium/350145.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=\"caption\"&gt;Mount Shasta rises above Shastina and Diller Canyon &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Diller Canyon&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;One of the larger canyons on Mount Shasta, Diller Canyon occupies Shastina&rsquo;s western slope.  The canyon is wide and deep and is prominently visible from the Weed area.  It is a popular route of descent for skiers.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Casaval Ridge&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Casval Ridge is one of the most rugged features on Mount Shasta.  The ridge runs up the southwest side of the mountain, terminating near the beginning of the Whitney Glacier.  A seemingly endless number of crags and spires give the ridge an incredibly serrated and unforgiving look.  A popular route to the summit follows the ridge.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Sargents Ridge&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Sargents Ridge is a massive rampart extending southeast from Mount Shasta&rsquo;s summit.  The ridge&rsquo;s cliffs rise more than 1,000 feet above the slopes below.  Sargents Ridge is another feature that is prominently visible from Mount Shasta City.  Shastarama Point forms the rough halfway point between Shasta&rsquo;s summit and the ridge&rsquo;s southern terminous.  A trail leading to Squaw / Southgate Meadow climbs its lowest flanks.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;div align=\"center\" class=\"image-left\" style=\"width: 506px;\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"/mount-shasta/834474\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Mount Shasta\" height=\"333\" width=\"500\" src=\"/images/medium/834474.JPG\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=\"caption\"&gt;Konwakiton Glacier&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_18\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Glaciers&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;br&gt;Seven glaciers are found on the slopes of Mount Shasta.  Only the western side of the mountain does not contain glaciers.  The southern side of the mountain is home to the three smaller glaciers: Mud Creek, Konwakiton and Watkins.  Mud Creek and Konwakiton Glaciers feed Mud Creek while springs fed by the Watkins Glacier are the source of Clear Creek.  The northern and eastern sides of Mount Shasta are covered by the four major glaciers; Whitney, Bolam, Hotlum and Wintun.  These are California&rsquo;s largest and most active glaciers.  The Whitney Glacier is the longest in the state, reaching a length of nearly 2 miles.  The Hotlum Glacier is California&rsquo;s largest in terms of volume and surface area.  A section of this glacier has separated from the main formation and is unofficially referred to as the Chicago Glacier.  This appellation is a result of the University of Chicago&rsquo;s long-term glaciology research conducted in the area. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A study conducted in the early 00&rsquo;s revealed that the glaciers on Mount Shasta had grown.  Some had seen 50% increases in size while others had doubled.  This is in sharp contrast to the glaciers in the Sierra Nevada, which are receding.&lt;a name=\"chapter_19\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;History&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;div align=\"center\" class=\"image-right\" style=\"width: 506px;\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"/mount-shasta/484486\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Mount Shasta\" height=\"330\" width=\"500\" src=\"/images/medium/484486.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=\"caption\"&gt;A lenticular cloud develops on Mount Shasta&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br&gt;Native Americans originally inhabited the region around Mount Shasta.  Three tribes occupied the area, their territories roughly intersecting at the mountain.  To the east the Modocs occupied the marshy lands of the Modoc Plateau.  Northward, the Klamaths lived in the greater Klamath River area.  South of Mount Shasta dwelt the Wintun.  It was this tribe that lived closest to the mountain.  The massive volcano held special religious significance to all the tribes.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Mount Shasta was the last major peak of the Cascades to be discovered by Europeans.  All the other major peaks had been identified prior to the 19th century.  This is due to Shasta&rsquo;s remote location, far from the original population centers of California and Oregon.  The first sighting by a European is believed to have occurred in 1786 when a French explorer saw a volcanic eruption from sea.  Scholars are unsure the eruption spotted by the explorer was Shasta, but that was roughly the time of the last known eruption.  No other record of Mount Shasta appears until 1827 when mountain man Peter Ogden spotted a large snowy cone and a nearby river.  He named the peak and river &ldquo;Sastise&rdquo;.  While the name eventually stuck, it is now believed that rather spotting Mount Shasta and the Shasta River, Ogden actually spotted Mount McLoughlin and the Rogue River in Oregon.  References to Mount Shasta continued to be sporadic after Ogden&rsquo;s possible discovery.  John Fremont passed beneath the mountain in 1846 and declared the mountain unclimbable.  So it remained for 8 more years until Elias Pierce became the first man to reach the summit.&lt;br&gt;&lt;div align=\"center\" class=\"image-left\" style=\"width: 506px;\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"/mt-shasta-from-shasta-valley/271967\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Mt. Shasta from Shasta Valley\" height=\"333\" width=\"500\" src=\"/images/medium/271967.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=\"caption\"&gt;Mount Shasta towers above the Shasta Valley&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br&gt;After Fremont had passed through the Shasta area while on a surveying expedition, the Gold Rush had begun in the Sierra Nevada.  By 1850 it had moved north, exploiting the parts of the Klamath Mountains that had similar compositions to the Sierras.  While regions like the Trinity Alps and the mountains above Yreka yielded great wealth, prospectors in the Castle Crags had not produced significant lodes.  Nonetheless, their presence placed enough pressure on the local Wintun that a battle erupted in 1855 near Castle Lake.  This battle is believed to have been the last pitched exchange in the West where the Indians fought exclusively with bow and arrow.  Famed western poet Joaquin Miller was a resident of the Shasta area at the time and participated in the battle.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As a result of the mining operations, small communities began sprouting up in the Mount Shasta area.  The valley to the southwest of the mountain became known as the Strawberry Valley and in 1853 a man named Justin Sisson built an inn that he would operate for many years thereafter.  That same year Ross McCloud built the first sawmill in the area, foreshadowing what was to become the regions major industry.  By the 1880&rsquo;s the mines had mostly played out but the Central Pacific Railroad had laid track up the Sacramento River Canyon, opening the area up to logging and tourism.  While logging has declined substantially from the mid-19th century to the present, it does continue to this day.  Tourism has seen a corresponding increase.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;div align=\"center\" class=\"image-right\" style=\"width: 506px;\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"/mt-shasta-from-the-bolam-trailhead/291310\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Mt. Shasta from the Bolam Trailhead\" height=\"333\" width=\"500\" src=\"/images/medium/291310.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=\"caption\"&gt;Mount Shasta from the approach to the Whitney Glacier&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Famous Visitors&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Mount Shasta has always attracted those with an eye for natural world.  Many of the luminaries of exploration, wilderness preservation and mountaineering have passed under the mountains shadow.  Most who did come to the area did so as guests of Sisson and stayed at his inn.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It has already been noted that John Fremont passed through the Shasta area.  Another great explorer of the West, Clarence King made several expeditions to Mount Shasta.  He is credited with discovering (and naming) the Whitney Glacier, the first glacier to be found in California.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;John Wesley Powell also came to Mount Shasta.  The one-armed major from the Civil War reached the summit in 1879.  While he is certainly justly known for his epic trips of discovery, he was also an important ethnologist.  He came to Shasta to study the Wintun tribe and it was he who named the Bolam, Hotlum, Wintun and Konwakiton Glaciers, using words from the tribe&rsquo;s language.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Albert Bierstadt, the famed painter of the American West, spent time in Shasta after departing Yosemite and completed several sketches of the mountain from several angles and times of day.  He completed one painting of Shasta.  Ludlow Fitzhugh, Bierstadt&rsquo;s traveling companion stated that:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;\"Certainly no peak which we met in all our large experience of the mountains of this continent ever compared with Shasta in producing the effect of vast height.\"&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;-Ludlow Fitzhugh, &lt;i&gt;On Horseback into Oregon&lt;/i&gt;, 1864&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;President Theodore Roosevelt came to Mount Shasta during his famous tour through California.  After the trip he declared:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;\"I consider the evening twilight on Mt. Shasta one of the grandest sights I have ever witnessed.\"&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;John Muir, famed lover of the Sierra Nevada, also had a deep love for Mount Shasta.  He made several trips to the mountain, many before the railroad up the Sacramento River Canyon had been built.  This required a difficult journey through the dense forests north of Redding.  It was while making one of these trips that Muir stated:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;\"When I first caught sight of it over the braided folds of the Sacramento Valley, I was fifty miles away and afoot, alone and weary. Yet all my blood turned to wine, and I have not been weary since.\"&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;- John Muir, &lt;i&gt;Letters, 1874-1888&lt;/i&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_20\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Lenticular Clouds&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;div align=\"center\" class=\"image-left\" style=\"width: 506px;\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"/mount-shasta/484169\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Mount Shasta\" height=\"333\" width=\"500\" src=\"/images/medium/484169.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=\"caption\"&gt;A lenticular cloud hovers on Mount Shasta while another develops to the south&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br&gt;Mount Shasta is known for its magnificent lenticular cloud displays.  These clouds tend to form around prominent peaks or mountain ranges.  Isolated peaks, such as Mount Shasta, often display lenticular clouds shaped liked lenses near the mountains summit.  Mountain ranges usually produce long, running waves rather than the lens shape.  The clouds are formed when the mountain forces fluctuating, warmer air currents to go over the mountain.  As the air rises it cools.  If the rising air reaches the dew point, the water vapor begins to condense.  This is the bottom of the lenticular cloud.  The water vapor continues to condense as the air current flows over the mountain.  This is what causes the arced, lens shape formation.  When air drops back down the mountain and warms the condensed water revaporizes and the clouds terminus is formed.  The fluctuations in the air flow is what is responsible for the constantly changing appearance of the cloud.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Lenticular clouds form on peaks throughout the world.  Nonetheless, Mount Shasta is well known for both the frequency and the magnitude of the clouds that are displayed by the mountain.  One cause for the particularly magnificent formations produced by Shasta is the mountains stunning prominence.  Rising over 10,000 feet above the surrounding landscape, the air is forced to undergo dramatic and unpredictable fluctuations in both temperature and elevation.  The fact that Mount Shasta rises from flat plains and forests only adds to the intensity of the conditions.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As beautiful as Mount Shasta is, the ever-present chance that a lenticular cloud, which is always unique, might develop keeps the mountains appearance fresh and challenging.  No matter how many times one sees the peak itself, it is always presenting some new aspect and vista, an unknown nuance to awe the spectator.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;table class=\"inline_image_thumbs\"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=484166\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/484166.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=464183\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/464183.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=478211\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/478211.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=484169\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/484169.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=299517\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/299517.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=605007\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/605007.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=484486\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/484486.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=708281\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/708281.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_21\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Telos, Lemuria And Mother Ships&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;div align=\"center\" class=\"image-right\" style=\"width: 506px;\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"/mount-shasta/299517\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Mount Shasta\" height=\"333\" width=\"500\" src=\"/images/medium/299517.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=\"caption\"&gt;The lenticular mothership settles on Mount Shasta&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br&gt;The towering, forbidding mass of Mount Shasta inspires awe in all who see it.  Native Americans revered the mountain since prehistoric times.  The mountain continues to be important to Native Americans today.  The Panther Meadow area holds particular significance to them.  Since the beginning of the 20th century, Shasta has become increasingly central to numerous spiritual groups and cults.  Several unusual ideas have been asserted regarding the mountain&hellip;and its residents.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Many (this means a lot, not just a handful) believe that those who survived the destruction of Atlantis made their way to Mount Shasta and built a vast city within its core.  The city, Telos, is now inhabited by enlightened Atlanteans.  Other groups believe that those who live inside the mountain are survivors of the collapse of Lemuria, a lost continent in the Pacific.  Like the Telosians, the Lemurians are thought to dwell within the mountain, although some claim to have encountered them while climbing Mount Shasta.  Mount Shasta has powers of its own, beyond its mysterious inhabitants.  It is considered one the worlds most powerful nexuses of New Age energy.  Consequently, one of the gatherings for the Harmonic Convergence occurred on the mountain.  Still others believe that Mount Shasta is a beacon to extraterrestrials.  As has happened in other places around the world, lenticular clouds are often viewed as UFO&rsquo;s or cover for the UFO&rsquo;s.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;While these beliefs seem to be wildly outlandish, many people sincerely hold them.  Some are prominent members of the Mount Shasta community.  It is not uncommon to see people chanting or meditating or praying on the mountain.  This is most common at Panther Meadows or at the Old Ski Bowl.  Please be aware of these individuals and show them courtesy.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_22\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Additional Information&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;div align=\"center\" class=\"image-left\" style=\"width: 506px;\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"/mount-shasta/470207\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Mount Shasta\" height=\"333\" width=\"500\" src=\"/images/medium/470207.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=\"caption\"&gt;Mount Shasta from the Castle Crags Wilderness&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_23\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Literature&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;br&gt;Several good books addressing various aspects of a trip to Mount Shasta are available.  The venerable classic is Selters and Zanger\'s \"The Mount Shasta Book\".  This book provides overviews of all the major routes to the summit and their variations.  Hikes on the mountain and in the greater region are included, as are mountain biking and whitewater rafting options.  The Wilderness Press map is included with the book.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If climbing the Avalanche Gulch is one\'s intent, then Lewis\' \"Climbing Mt. Shasta: Route 1, Avalanche Gulch\" is good.  It includes a significant amount of tangential information regarding peripheral issues such as gear.  The book is intended more for beginners.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Kohn\'s \"Mount Shasta Book Of Fun\" is a great resource for the greater Mount Shasta region, as well as the mountain itself.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_24\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Maps&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;br&gt;Excellent maps topographic maps are available from Tom Harrison and Wilderness Press.  The Forest Service also offers an excellent map that has Mount Shasta on one side and the Castle Crags Wilderness on the other. All aforementioned maps are adaptations of the USGS Mount Shasta map.&lt;br&gt;&lt;div align=\"center\" class=\"image-right\" style=\"width: 506px;\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"/mt-shasta-and-mt-eddy/306094\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Mt.

While all offer lodging and dining, the town of Mount Shasta is the most centrally located and offers the most amenities.  All routes are easily reached from the community and the Everitt Memorial Highway departs from the heart of town to the Bunny Flat trailhead. Supplies are available at Ray\'s Food Place (off of Lake) and the Mount Shasta Market (on Alma).  The town also has a full service hospital available for medical needs.  The Forest Service ranger station is located on Alma.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Dining&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Mount Shasta has a number of good restaurants.  The following are some of the better choices (obviously, this is somewhat objective):&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;Poncho and Lefkowitz&lt;/i&gt; &lt;br&gt;Absolutely the best food in town.  As they say, \"locals know Poncho\'s!\"  Serves a variety of Mexican food and gourmet German sausages.  Run by a great crew who love the mountain, the sun, and great blues and rock.  You absolutely can\'t go wrong here.  Located on Mount Shasta Boulevard.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Billy Goat&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;Great brews and awesome burgers.  This is a popular climber\'s gathering place.  Has indoor and outdoor seating.  Located on Mount Shasta Boulevard.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;Dos Gecko\'s&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;Good option for Mexican food designed on the \"build it yourself\" model.  Many more options than one might expect.  Located on Mount Shasta Boulevard.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;Vivify&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;Astoundingly good sushi restaurant.  Famed Bay Area sushi chef\'s retirement project.  Far better than one might expect to find in such an isolated region.  Located on Chestnut Street.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;Say Cheese Pizza&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;There is a Round Table Pizza in Mount Shasta that is good as always, but Say Cheese is a local joint that that doubles as a sports bar.  The pizza is plenty good too.  Located on Lake Street.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;Trinity Cafe&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;Higher end, great food and frequented by many post-climb groups.

Its reputation as a highly coveted summit derives from its location near the Arctic Circle and the Pacific Ocean (Gulf of Alaska) giving it some of the most ferocious weather in the world. Because of its notorious weather and ease of access, some climbers use Denali as a training ground for climbing the 8,000 meter peaks of the Himalaya and for extended expeditions in the Arctic or Antarctic. And for all you peakbaggers out there, Denali is the highpoint of the Denali Borough, the state of Alaska, the United States, the Alaska Range, and North America.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Denali offers one of the world\'s greatest expedition challenges. While it is exceeded in elevation by peaks in South America and Asia, its great height above the Alaskan plain make it a severe test of personal strength, team work, and logistics. No peak in the world has greater relief: Denali rises 17,000 feet above its surrounding plain, Kilimanjaro 14,000 feet, and Everest 13,000 feet. Vertical elevation gain on Everest from the normal base camp for the South Col route is 11,000 feet; from the landing spot on the Kahiltna Glacier Denali\'s summit rises another 13,000 feet. Further, the mountain (and all mountains this far north or south) behaves like it\'s taller than it really is --- the reason being that the barometric pressure in the northern/southern latitudes is less than at the equator which makes climbers feel higher than they really are.&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;table class=\"inline_image_thumbs\"&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=434210\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/small/434210.jpg\" unselectable=\"on\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=411115\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/small/411115.jpg\" unselectable=\"on\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=831361\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/small/831361.jpg\" unselectable=\"on\" style=\"\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=434140\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/small/434140.jpg\" unselectable=\"on\" style=\"\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=113295\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_2\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h3&gt;What\'s In A Name?&lt;/h3&gt;Denali is known by its Athabascan name, meaning \"The Great One\" and some climbers refuse to use \"McKinley\" when referring to the mountain. In fact, at least half a dozen names exist for the highest mountain in North America and most translate to \"The Great One.\" Americans are the only ones who have previously bucked this trend and named it after a President from Ohio (William McKinley has often been considered a straw President --- put into power by Rockefeller\'s enormous campaign contributions in order to avoid a then-aspiring Teddy Roosevelt and his party\'s threat to break up the industrial monoploies with new anti-trust legislation). &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Denali was renamed Mount McKinley by the Princeton graduate and gold prospector, William Dickey. Dickey was one of the hundreds of prospectors seeking gold in the 1896 Cook Inlet stampede. He had written an article for the New York Sun where he described the mountain as the highest in North America at over 20,000 feet. When later asked why he named the mountain after McKinley, Dickey replied that \"the verbal bludgeoning he had received from free silver partisans had inspired him to retaliate with the name of the gold-standard champion\" (Source: &lt;i&gt;Mt. McKinley: The Pioneer Climbs&lt;/i&gt; by Terris Moore). Since the turn of the 19th century, the official name of this great mountain has not rested in peace. In 1914, following his historic first ascent of the mountain in 1913, Hudson Stuck wrote in the preface of his book, &lt;i&gt;The Ascent of Denali&lt;/i&gt;, \"forefront in this book, because forefront in the author\'s heart and desire, must stand a plea for the restoration to the greatest mountain in North America of its immemorial native name.\"&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Ever since the mountain\'s name was changed to McKinley, an effort has been under way to change it back to Denali. In 1980, the name Mount McKinley National Park was officially changed to Denali National Park and Preserve. The State of Alaska Board of Geographic Names has also officially changed the mountain\'s name back to Denali. The State of Alaska now recognizes it as Denali and the Feds have changed the name of the national park. Shortly after Winston Churchill\'s death in 1965, the National Park Service, after being goaded to do so by Alaska\'s Senator Ernest Gruening, named Mount McKinley and the North Peak of Mount McKinley the Churchill Peaks. The individual summit is still officially known as Mount McKinley. Thanks to SP member, &lt;a href=\"http://www.summitpost.org/users/steve-gruhn/21394\"&gt;Steve Gruhn&lt;/a&gt; for that info (he\'s also one of the best all around resources for mountaineering information in Alaska).&lt;p&gt;In 2009, Alaska State Representative Scott Kawasaki sponsored Alaska House Joint Resolution 15, which urged Congress to rename the mountain Denali. Despite efforts in Alaska, Ohio Representatives Betty Sutton and Tim Ryan introduced H.R. 229 which reads: \"Notwithstanding any other authority of law, the mountain located 63 degrees 04 minutes 12 seconds north, by 151 degrees 00 minutes 18 seconds west shall continue to be named and referred to for all purposes as Mount McKinley.\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A January 2015 bill submitted by Alaska Senator Lisa Murkowski re-proposed renaming North America\'s highest peak as Denali. In June 2015 testimony to Congress, the National Park Service\'s associate director stated that the NPS \"has no objection to adopting the name of Denali for Mt. McKinley\". On August 30, 2015, Sally Jewell announced that the mountain would be renamed Denali, under authority of federal law which permits her as Secretary of the Interior to name geographic features if the Board of Geographic Names does not act within a \"reasonable\" period of time. In media interviews, Jewell cited the board\'s failure to act on the state\'s four-decade-old request, saying \"I think any of us would think that 40 years is an unreasonable amount of time.\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_3\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Denali National Park&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;br&gt;The park was established as Mt. McKinley National Park on February 26, 1917. The original park was designated a wilderness area at inception and was further designated an international biosphere reserve in 1976. The Park was incorporated into Denali National Park and Preserve in 1980. Today the park accommodates a wide variety of visitor use including wildlife viewing, mountaineering, and backpacking as well as providing a laboratory for research in the natural sciences. More than 425,000 people visit this world-class national park every year.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The park was originally established to protect wildlife and its habitat. At the time there were many people living and hunting in the area, and they needed meat for themselves and their dog teams. The easiest source of meat was hunting Dall sheep. Charles Sheldon, a hunter and naturalist, came to the Denali area in 1906 to study the Dall sheep. Seeing the need to protect this area and the sheep from commercial hunting, Sheldon lobbied Congress to set the area aside as a national park. Congress agreed with Sheldon, and in 1917, about two million acres of an area (including Denali) were set aside as Mt. McKinley National Park. In 1980, through the Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act, the park\'s name was changed, and at the same time, its acreage was tripled, setting the footprint of what today is Denali National Park and Preserve. The park covers more than six million acres which includes a complete sub-arctic ecosystem home to large mammals such as grizzly bears, wolves, Dall sheep, and moose. Additionally, almost the entire original two million acres are designated a wilderness area. The Park and Preserve is located in the heart of the Alaska Range and is home to countless glaciated mountains and granite peaks accompanied by some of the worlds largest, longest, and deepest glaciers. - Source &lt;a href=\"http://www.nps.gov/dena/planyourvisit/upload/Ed%20Packet%20(revised%202008,msj).pdf\"&gt;NPS Website&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_4\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Mountain History&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_5\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Location&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;br&gt;Denali (and the National Park) is located approximately 200 miles north of Anchorage, Alaska.

About 60 million years ago (Paleocene epoch), semi-liquid magma intruded below the surface of the earth, and slowly cooled from 100 degrees Centigrade to form the McKinley/Denali pluton (a body of igneous rock formed beneath the surface of the earth by consolidation of magma). The pluton composing Denali\'s neighboring peaks is considerably younger, 38 million years old. As the millennia went by, a sea covered the area where the park is today and deposited much sediment. Later, a tropical forest grew here, resulting in the coal-bearing formation which is mined near the park today. Eventually geological forces caused the land to rise and buckle, resulting in the metamorphic rock (rock that has been transformed from one type of rock to another by heat and pressure) sequences found in the park. Much more recently, two to five million years ago, the McKinley/Denali pluton and the metamorphic rock lying on top of it were uplifted to the great height of today, forming the Alaska Range and Denali.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div style=\"WIDTH: 506px\" class=\"image\" align=\"center\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"/a-distance-view-of-mckinley-denali/263476\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"A distance view of McKinley (Denali)\" src=\"/images/medium/263476.jpg\" width=\"500\" height=\"342\" unselectable=\"on\" style=\"\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=\"caption\"&gt;The Alaska Range as viewed from the north.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br&gt;Some of the molten rock cooled in large pools called batholiths (large masses of igneous rock that have melted and intruded surrounding strata at great depths). The slowly-cooled rock, granite, is resistant to the effects of wind, water, and ice. Denali is a batholith that was once deep in the earth. As the tectonic plates shifted, it pushed through the softer rock surrounding it to the surface and up to 20,320 feet, creating the tallest mountain in North America. This granite mountain contains some of the most dramatic rises in the world, such as the 15,000-foot Wickersham Wall. While water and wind have taken their toll on most of the softer sedimentary rock, some of this rock still remains, like a lovely hat capping the top of the North Peak.&lt;a name=\"chapter_7\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Climbing History&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_8\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Early Climbing Controversy&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;br&gt;The earliest attempts at climbing Denali began in the late-1800\'s. In 1906, Frederick Cook claimed the first ascent, but his claim was later discredited after his \"summit\" photos were proven to be from the summit of an insignificant peaklet more than 10 miles away from Denali\'s true summit. In 1910, a team of four \"sourdoughs\" with no previous mountaineering experience managed to climb the lower North Peak of Denali. Their claims were dismissed until later climbers found a 14-foot spruce pole they had erected near its summit.&lt;br&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_9\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h3&gt;First Ascents&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;Karstens Ridge/Muldrow Glacier&lt;/i&gt; - 1913, the first ascent of Denali\'s 20,320-ft south summit achieved by Hudson Stuck, Walter Harper, Harry Karstens, and Robert Tatum. Harper, a Native Alaskan, is first to set foot on top.&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;table class=\"inline_image_thumbs\"&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=831305\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/small/831305.jpg\" unselectable=\"on\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=277048\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/small/277048.jpg\" unselectable=\"on\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=831532\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/small/831352.jpg\" unselectable=\"on\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=831349\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/small/831349.jpg\" unselectable=\"on\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;West Buttress&lt;/i&gt; - 1951, route pioneered by Bradford Washburn. Art Davidson, Dave Johnston, and Ray Genet made the first winter ascent of the mountain via the West Buttress route in 1967.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;West Rib&lt;/i&gt; - 1959, Peter Sinclair, Jake Breitenbach, Barry Corbet, and Bill Buckingham - 1960 &lt;i&gt;American Alpine Journal&lt;/i&gt;. First solo ascent was in 1977 by Rupert Kammerlander. First winter ascent was a group in 1983.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;Cassin Ridge&lt;/i&gt; - 1961, Riccardo Cassin et al. 1967 - Japanese variation (standard beginning of Cassin that joins another \"Japanese Couloir\" about halfway up the route). The first solo ascent was in 1976 done by Charlie Porter (in 36 hours to the summit nonetheless) and the first winter ascent was in 1983 done by Jonathan Waterman, Roger Mear, and Mike Young. The immortal Mugs Stump made the summit in 15 hours in 1991 which is still considered (arguably) the strongest climb of the route since the first ascent. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Please see the NPS &lt;a href=\"http://www.nps.gov/dena/planyourvisit/climbinghistory.htm\"&gt;website&lt;/a&gt; for other \"firsts.\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div style=\"WIDTH: 156px\" class=\"image-left\" align=\"center\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"/denali/831293\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Denali\" src=\"/images/small/831293.JPG\" width=\"150\" height=\"200\" unselectable=\"on\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=\"caption\"&gt;Welcome to the show...&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_10\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Climbing Today&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;br&gt;During the 2012 season, Denali saw 1,223 climbers try for the summit. Of those attempts, 498 (or 41%) made the summit.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Since 1903, the mountain has a historical summit rate of 52%. The climbing rates didn\'t start to jump until 1976 when the mountain saw more than 500 climbers for the first time in a calendar season. Since then, the year with the greatest summit rate was 1979 (79%) and the year with the lowest was 1987 (31%). Most people will agree that the summit rate is higher with guided groups and they make up approximately 40% of the traffic. Therefore, a rough estimate is that guided groups get to the summit about 55-60% of the time and private groups about 45-50% of the time.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There have been 19,564 people (including repeats) to reach the summit through the 2011 climbing season. The legendary &lt;a href=\"http://www.alpineascents.com/guides.asp#tejas\"&gt;Vern Tejas&lt;/a&gt; (currently a guide with Alpine Ascents International) is widely thought to have the most summits (approximately 50) and was the first solo ascentionist in calendar winter. In 2011, May saw 236 summits, June 358, and July 93. The busiest summit days were June 6 (66 people), May 27 (45 people), May 30 (45 people), June 17 (39 people) and July 7 (39 people). 131 women attempted Denali (or about 11%). US climbers make up about 60% of the total, and Canada, the UK, Poland, and Japan with 3-5% each. Climbers from Alaska, Washington, Colorado and California make up the bulk of the US participants. For more information, please see the NPS &lt;a href=\"http://www.nps.gov/dena/planyourvisit/upload/OVERALLCLIMBERS-2011.pdf\"&gt;website&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_11\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Route Choices&lt;/h2&gt;The majority of climbers on Denali (over 90%) attempt the West Buttress route, which is considered the least technical way to get to the summit. The Muldrow Glacier on the north side of the mountain is similar with regard to technical difficulty and length, but is far more committing and involved as you begin the climb by hiking in rather than flying to a base camp. Though technically much more difficult, the West Rib is the next most attempted route after the West Buttress, but only sees a handful of parties each year. In technical terms, it is substantially more difficult and more objectively dangerous as compared to the West Buttress. Beyond those three well known routes, the remaining options are significantly more technical, committing, and difficult.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_12\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h3&gt;West Buttress (Alaska Grade 2+, Class 3-4)&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://www.summitpost.org/west-buttress/159690\"&gt;The West Buttress&lt;/a&gt; has been derided as \"the Denali Iditarod\" or \"the Scenic Loop.\" However, this is in context to Denali being fondly referred to as the \"Mid-life Crisis Mountain\" --- in 2011, the average age of a Denali climber was exactly 40 years old. While there is always some truth to nicknames, many people aspire to climb the West Buttress and the climb is undoubtedly considered as an exceptional mountaineering challenge. Nowhere in the world does one travel with so much gear over so much vertical in such a hostile environment. Although there are no technically difficult sections on the route, many stretches of \"The Butt\" leave very little margin for error (the lower glacier in warm conditions, Windy Corner, the Autobahn, Denali Pass, and the Summit Ridge). Furthermore, the West Buttress is just as exposed as any other route to Denali\'s legendary weather. Prospective climbers should be highly competent in travel on moderately steep snow/ice slopes and exposed traverses.&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;table class=\"inline_image_thumbs\"&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=831308\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/small/831308.jpg\" unselectable=\"on\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=831355\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/small/831355.jpg\" unselectable=\"on\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=831354\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/small/831354.jpg\" unselectable=\"on\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=831314\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/small/831314.jpg\" unselectable=\"on\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=831357\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/small/831357.jpg\" unselectable=\"on\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;The most popular camps are located at 7,200 ft (base camp); 7,800 ft; 9,500 ft; 11,000 ft; 14,200 ft; and 17,200 ft. Other camps are located at 12,500 ft and 16,000 ft, but should only be used under ideal weather conditions as the 12,500 ft camp is vulnerable to avalanches and the 16,000 ft camp is very exposed to high winds. The 11,000 ft camp also experiences avalanches and serac fall, and care should be taken to avoid these two hazards when setting up camp. Above 14,200 ft, snow caves or igloos are usually constructed as a back up shelter in case bad weather moves in. There are usually NPS Rangers at 7,200 ft and 14,200 ft. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Total horizontal length of the West Buttress route is approximately 13 miles with about 13,500 ft of vertical gain. Between base camp and 11,000 ft, the route is relatively flat and the main hazards are crevasse falls. Above 11,000 ft, the route steepens to moderate slopes (35-45 degrees) alternating with flat benches and bowls. Equipment and supplies are typically carried by sled to 11,000 ft or all the way to 14,000 ft. Above 11,000 ft, gear and food can be ferried between camps in two trips. West Buttress expeditions average around 17 days, but climbers should take at least 3 weeks of supplies. A 2-3 day supply of food and fuel should be left at base camp in case weather prevents planes from landing on the glacier (climbers have been stranded for as long as two weeks due to inclement weather).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_13\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h3&gt;West Rib (Alaska Grade 4, AI 3)&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;For some Denali afficionados, the West Rib is the next step after completing the West Buttress or Karstens Ridge, but it represents a significant step up in skill and experience. The route involves moderate to steep snow as well as mixed snow and rock. The West Rib is a commiting route, but does offer retreat/escape points along the way. The West Rib offers steeper climbing and fewer crowds then its neighbor to the west. The Rib is not known for its technical challenges, but more for its sustained steepness and appeal for climbing on Denali\'s south face.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div style=\"WIDTH: 506px\" class=\"image\" align=\"center\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"/denali/831301\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Denali\" src=\"/images/medium/831301.JPG\" width=\"500\" height=\"375\" unselectable=\"on\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=\"caption\"&gt;A view of the West Rib from +/- 14,000 ft&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br&gt;The West Rib offers two variations --- the Complete West Rib or the West Rib Cutoff. The complete Rib starts in the NE fork of the Kahiltna Glacier and is the most dangerous portion of the climb with respect to objective hazards (avalanche, crevasse). If conditions allow entrance into the NE fork, then a 9,000 ft ridge climb comprises the Complete West Rib. Most climbers choose to do the West Rib Cutoff, which ascends the standard West Buttress route until 14,200 ft. At 14,000 ft you leave the crowds of the West Buttress and traverse to the West Rib gaining the ridge at around 15,700 ft. You then ascent the upper ridge making one camp along the way. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_14\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Cassin Ridge (Alaska Grade 5, 5.8, AI 4)&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://www.summitpost.org/cassin-ridge/246396\"&gt;The Cassin Ridge&lt;/a&gt; is today considered a \"50 Classic\" of North America and was first climbed in 1961 by a group led by Italian alpinist Riccardo Cassin, for which the route is named. The Cassin Ridge rises 8000 feet from the very bottom of Denali\'s South face to within a few yards of the true summit of the mountain. Steep snow, ice, and mixed climbing make this one of the most sought-after big mountain alpine climbs in the world. Climbers completing the Cassin Ridge find themselves in a small fraternity of elite Alaska climbers. The route ascends the prominent ridge on the south face and is steep, demanding, and committing --- escape routes are few and far between. As a result, only the most experienced climbers will think of attempting it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div style=\"WIDTH: 506px\" class=\"image\" align=\"center\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"/sunrise-at-denali-pass/270592\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Sunrise at Denali Pass\" src=\"/images/medium/270592.jpg\" width=\"500\" height=\"233\" unselectable=\"on\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=\"caption\"&gt;Sunrise at Denali Pass.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_15\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Muldrow Glacier (Alaska Grade 3, Class 3-4)&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Karstens Ridge/Muldrow Glacier was the route of first ascent and used to be the standard route before Bradford Washburn pioneered the West Buttress route. This route is similar in difficulty as the West Buttress, but receives far less traffic. Expeditions are, on average, a week longer than West Buttress trips because of the longer approach from Wonder Lake. More adventurous climbers will attempt \"the Traverse,\" by ascending the West Buttress and descending Karstens Ridge or vice versa. The Traverse is more strenuous than doing either route alone because climbers must haul all equipment and supplies over Denali Pass whereas climbers doing one route or another typically cache equipment and supplies that are not needed higher up on the mountain.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div style=\"WIDTH: 506px\" class=\"image\" align=\"center\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"/denali/831302\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Denali\" src=\"/images/medium/831302.JPG\" width=\"500\" height=\"375\" unselectable=\"on\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=\"caption\"&gt;Looking down the Muldrow Glacier&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_16\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Ratings&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;Alaska Grades are confusing. In 1966, Boyd Everett, Jr (a then-very acomplished Alaska mountaineer) presented a paper titled &lt;i&gt;The Organization of an Alaskan Expedition&lt;/i&gt; at a Harvard Mountaineering Club seminar where he attempted to outline a rating system for Alsaka routes/summits (on a scale 1-6). For many years, this system was the standard (as the basis of it still is). In &lt;i&gt;Alaska: A Climbing Guide&lt;/i&gt;, Michael Woods &amp;amp; Colby Coombs attmepted to simplify the system with definitions that make more sense for todays alpinists. Taken into account are things like: length of time on the route, camping options, length of route, technical difficulty, the sustained nature of the route, difficulty of descent, and difficulty of retreat. Its fundamental belief is that the system reflects \"the average time for recent ascents by climbers with experience and physical level compatible to the chosen route.\" What follows is their interpretation of what Alaska grades are to mean today:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;Alaska Grade 1:&lt;/i&gt; Can be climbed in one day from base camp and requires third and fourth class travel. Remoteness can contribute to seriousness.&lt;br&gt;Exapmles include: Mt Goode (E Ridge), Mt Redoubt (N Face), Mt Dickey (W Face), Mt Brooks (N Ridge) --- and for comparison sakes, &lt;a href=\"http://www.summitpost.org/mount-rainier/150291\"&gt;Mt Rainier&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"http://www.summitpost.org/disappointment-cleaver/155670\"&gt;Disappointment Cleaver&lt;/a&gt;) is Alaska Grade 1+ which translates to 35-45 degree ice and snow slopes, Grade II.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;Alaska Grade 2:&lt;/i&gt; Moderate fifth class climb that can be accomplished in a day, or a mutiday climb involving third and fourth class travel. one or more of the following will contribute to the seriousness: altitude, remoteness.&lt;br&gt;Examples include: Four Horsemen (W Couloir to S Ridge), Denali (W Buttress), Blackburn (N Ridge), Mt Bona (E Ridge), Mt Hayes (E Ridge).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;Alaska Grade 3:&lt;/i&gt; Difficult fifth class climb that can be accomplished in a day, or a multiday climb involving fourth and easy fifth class travel. One or more of the following will contribute to the seriousness: altitude, remoteness, cornicing, knife-edge ridges.&lt;br&gt;Examples include: Mt Foraker (Sultana Ridge), Mooses Tooth (Ham &amp;amp; Eggs Couloir), Mt Fairweather (Carpe Ridge), Mt Huntington (W Face Couloir).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;Alaska Grade 4:&lt;/i&gt; Moderate fourth and fifth class climbs that require multiple days on route. One or more of the following will contribute to the seriousness: altitude, remoteness, cornicing, knife-edge ridges.&lt;br&gt;Examples include: Mt St Elias (Harvard Route), Mt Hunter (W Ridge), Mt Moffit (N Ridge).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;Alaska Grade 5:&lt;/i&gt; A climb requiring a high level of commitment with sustained fifth class climbing; multiple days on route. One or more of the following will contribute to the seriousness: altitude, cornicing, knife-edge ridges, limited options for retreat, scarce bivi sites.&lt;br&gt;Examples include: University Peak (E Face), Mt Augusta (S Ridge).&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div style=\"WIDTH: 506px\" class=\"image\" align=\"center\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"/denali/831270\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Denali\" src=\"/images/medium/831270.JPG\" width=\"500\" height=\"375\" unselectable=\"on\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=\"caption\"&gt;If you are curious what Alaska Grade 6 looks like...&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;Alaska Grade 6:&lt;/i&gt; A climb requiring an extreme level of commitment with difficult and sustained fifth class climbing for more than 4,000 feet requiring multiple days on route. One or more of the following will contribute to the seriousness: altitude, remoteness, cornicing, knife-edge ridges, poor retreat options, scarce and/or hanging bivis.&lt;br&gt;Examples include: Mt Hunter (Moonflower), Mt Foraker (Infinite Spur).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;- Source:&lt;i&gt; &lt;a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Alaska-Climbing-Guide-Guides/dp/089886724X/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;amp;ie=UTF8&amp;amp;qid=1355071334&amp;amp;sr=1-1&amp;amp;keywords=alaska+a+climbing+guide\"&gt;Alaska: A Climbing Guide&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt; by Michael Woods and Colby Coombs (Mountaineers, 2001).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_17\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Other Technical/Alpine Routes&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;Please see the list below for some of the better known climbing options on Denali.

The airport is located about four miles south of the city proper. Anyone not from Alaska is better off flying to Anchorage for an attempt on Denali. While Anchorage is not a huge passenger destination compared to the rest of the world, it is the 5th largest cargo airport in the world (after Hong Kong, Memphis, Seoul, and Shanghai).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Most people will land in one of the three concourses in the Southern Terminal. Major airlines that service the area include: Air Canada, Alaska Airlines, American, Delta, Frontier, JetBlue, Sun Country, United, and US Air (read NO Southwest - bags DONT Fly For Free).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Regarding TSA...&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Camp stoves can travel as carry-on or checked luggage only if they are empty of all fuel and then cleaned such that no fuel vapors or residue are noticeable. Aerosol insecticides are not permitted in carry-on; however they are permitted in checked baggage as long as they are not labeled as hazardous material (HAZMAT). Wrap cords and layer items in bags so officers can get a clear view of the items. Flammable items include aerosols, fuels, gasoline, gas torches, lighter fluid, flammable paints, turpentine, paint thinner and realistic replicas of incendiaries. Lighters that do not contain fuel are permitted in checked baggage. Any sharp objects placed in carry-on or checked baggage should be properly sheathed or securely wrapped to prevent injury to TSOs and baggage handlers. Even if an item is generally permitted, it may be subject to additional screening or not allowed through the checkpoint if it triggers an alarm during the screening process, appears to have been tampered with, or poses other security concerns. The final decision rests with TSA on whether to allow any items on the plane.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Also, wear your boots on the plane. In the event your luggage is lost you can salvage almost everything in Anchorage, EXCEPT your boots.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_21\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Anchorage&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;br&gt;From the Anchorage airport, it is roughly a two hour drive to Talkeetna (Talkeetna is a small town and the main staging area for climbing most routes on Denali and the Alaska Range in general). Limited supplies and equipment are available in Talkeetna, so it is best to get most of your shopping done in Anchorage before heading out.

The park is serviced by a 91-mile (146 km) road from the George Parks Highway to the mining camp of Kantishna. It runs east to west, north of and roughly parallel to the Alaska Range. Only a small fraction of the road is paved because permafrost and the freeze-thaw cycle create an enormous cost for maintaining the road. Only the first 15 miles (24 km) of the road are available to private vehicles, and beyond this point, visitors must access the interior of the park through concessionary buses. Wonder Lake can be reached by a six-hour bus ride from the Wilderness Access Center. Eielson Visitor Center is located four hours into the park on the road.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Several fully narrated tours of the park are available, the most popular of which is the Tundra Wilderness Tour. The tours travel from the initial boreal forests through tundra to the Toklat River or Kantishna. A clear view of the mountain is possible only about 20% of the time during the summer, although it is visible more often during the winter. Several portions of the road run alongside sheer cliffs that drop hundreds of feet at the edges, and there are no guardrails. As a result of the danger involved, and because most of the gravel road is only one lane wide, drivers should be trained extensively in procedures for navigating the sharp mountain curves, and yielding the right-of-way to opposing buses and park vehicles.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;While the main park road goes straight through the middle of the Denali National Park Wilderness, the national preserve and portions of the park not designated wilderness are even more inaccessible. There are no roads extending out to the preserve areas, which are on the far west end of the park. The far north of the park, characterized by hills and rivers, is accessed by the Stampede Trail, a dirt road which stops at the park boundary. The very rugged south portion of the park, characterized by enormous glacier-filled canyons, is accessed by Petersville Road, a dirt road that stops about 5 miles (8.0 km) outside the park.

Later in the season, many climbers opt to travel on the lower mountain during the evening hours when the snow is relatively firm. Denali veterans have said that the weather tends to be windy in May, stormy in July, and a mix of both in June. However, once you\'re on the mountain, you will find the weather to be more of a crapshoot than anything else.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div style=\"WIDTH: 506px\" class=\"image\" align=\"center\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"/denali/831080\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Denali\" src=\"/images/medium/831080.JPG\" width=\"500\" height=\"375\" unselectable=\"on\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=\"caption\"&gt;Welcome to basecamp...&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_26\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Sample Itinerary&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;Day 1: Land at Base Camp&lt;br&gt;Day 2: Rest day to organize gear and practice crevasse rescue&lt;br&gt;Day 3: Move to 7,800 ft camp&lt;br&gt;Day 4: Move to 9,500 ft camp&lt;br&gt;Day 5: Move to 11,000 ft camp&lt;br&gt;Day 6: Rest day&lt;br&gt;Day 7: Ferry loads to 14,200 ft camp, return to 11,000 ft camp&lt;br&gt;Day 8: Move to 14,200 ft camp&lt;br&gt;Day 9: Rest day&lt;br&gt;Day 10: Ferry loads to 17,200 ft camp, return to 14,200 ft&lt;br&gt;Day 11: Rest day&lt;br&gt;Day 12: Move to 17,200 ft camp&lt;br&gt;Day 13: Summit day&lt;br&gt;Day 14: Descend to 11,000 ft camp&lt;br&gt;Day 15: Descend to base camp, fly out&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Keep in mind that this itinerary does not factor in bad weather days when you will be tent-bound. Itineraries are also adjusted according to how quickly members of a team acclimatize to the altitude.

Just do it.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_27\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Winter Ascents&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;br&gt;The first winter ascent was accomplished on February 28, 1967 and is documented in the mountaineering classic, &lt;a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Minus-148-Degrees-Art-Davidson/dp/0898866871\"&gt;Minus 148&lt;/a&gt;. In 1998, three Russians made the first January ascent of Denali, a time of the year when the mountain receives only five or six hours of sunlight a day (click on this link for the press release: &lt;a href=\"http://classic.mountainzone.com/news/denali.html\"&gt;Mountain Zone&lt;/a&gt;). It seems as though every year, someone tries to climb Denali in calendar winter. Since the famous expedition of Art Davidson\'s Minus 148 book fame, a winter ascent of Denali has taken on an almost mythical notion. At that time of year, the sun is up from approximately 9am to 3pm. Temperatures can reach -100 or more. It\'s a sufferfest, but so goes the human race. Below are the last few excerpts from the Anchorage Daily News that cover these nuts every year.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://www.adn.com/2012/01/07/2251193/mckinley-climber-retreats-ending.html\"&gt;Lonnie Dupre&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://www.adn.com/2010/03/06/1171581/attempt-to-be-1st-woman-to-summit.html\"&gt;Christine Feret&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_28\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Red Tape&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_29\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Permits&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;br&gt;Mountaineers attempting a climb of Mt. McKinley or Mt. Foraker must register with the Talkeetna Ranger Station at least 60 days prior to their start date. The &lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mountaineering Special Use Fee of $350&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt; and will be charged in full at the time of registration to each expedition member (same fee applies to Denali or Mt. Foraker). A reduced fee of $250 will be charged for climbers aged 24 or younger as of the start date of the climb. At the time an expedition checks in for their climb, the Denali National Park entrance fee of $10 per individual is due. Interagency passes are accepted in lieu of entrance fee payment (actual passes must be presented). The preferred payment method is through our online registration system (link available the first week of October), which accepts credit card. For mail-in registrations, the NPS prefers credit card payments and personal checks will not be accepted. If the climb is cancelled prior to January 15 of the year in which the climb is scheduled, all but $100 of the fee will be refunded. No refund will be made for cancellations after January 15. Once the form and payment are correctly submitted, registrants will immediately receive a receipt confirmation from Pay.Gov via email. For groups who are unable to register online, the expedition leader can contact the Talkeetna Ranger Station to initiate manual registration. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Mountaineers that have climbed Mt. McKinley or Mt. Foraker since 1995 can request a \"seven-day exception\" to the 60-day pre-registration period and instead register only 7 days in advance of the climb. Individuals seeking registration under the \"seven-day exception\" must be on record at the Talkeetna Ranger Station as climbing in or after 1995. This rule is applied on an individual basis -- in order for the entire expedition to be eligible for the seven-day exception, all members must qualify. Expeditions are permitted to add one new member to their expedition. This new member must pay the climbing special use fee and register at least 30 days prior to the start date of the expedition.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_30\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Clean Mountain Canisters (CMCs)&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;Conceived by mountaineering ranger Roger Robinson, the Clean Mountain Can (CMC) is a portable toilet designed to address Denali\'s remote, rugged environment and the unique logistical challenges presented by a 3-week long expedition. Please do not use open-pit toilets as they are unsanitary, they produce large concentrations of feces, and they contaminate the snow used for making water. And worse, feces buried within one meter of snow surface will melt out during the climbing season! Clean Mountain Cans promote the Leave No Trace ethics in glacier environments and helps protect the environment for future generations. Additionally, they are lightweight, convenient, durable and reusable.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The durable CMC comes with a harness system that can lock the lid down and is sturdy enough to strap on a pack or sled. The CMC capacity is 10 to 14 uses (approximately one-half pound per use) including the addition of some toilet paper. The current model Clean Mountain Can (CMC) is designed to hold 1.88 gallons of human waste and has a U.S. Department of Transportation-approved two-way vent. Several CMC\'s have even been accidentally dropped off the West Buttress, tumbling over 2,000 feet without damage! &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If CMCs are not available for use (big \"if\" by the way), all human waste must be deposited into biodegradable bags (provided by the National Park Service) and disposed of in a deep crevasse away from popular trails. All bags will be marked with the expedition\'s name or permit number. In an effort to make sure that the snow is clean for future water supplies please consolidate pee holes away from camping areas and do not leave human waste on the snow.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div style=\"WIDTH: 206px\" class=\"image-left\" align=\"center\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"/denali/831345\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Denali\" src=\"/images/small/831345.jpg\" width=\"200\" height=\"150\" unselectable=\"on\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=\"caption\"&gt;Nice view.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br&gt;The National Park Service has installed outhouses for public use at Kahiltna Basecamp and 14,200 feet on the West Buttress of Denali Your cooperation in accepting these responsibilities will contribute significantly to the collective care for this special place, so that all may experience a pristine glacier environment, both now and in the future. The proper disposal of trash, fuel cans and human waste are not only the right thing to do, it is required. Failure to follow these requirements may result in the issuance of a violation notice, and/or additional legal actions.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;All trash must be carried off the mountain. If climbing in a private group, you will likely have your trash weighed upon return to basecamp (airstrip). All expeditions are required to transport trash in the blue bags (provided by the National Park Service). Climbers violating these rules will be fined and may be kicked off the mountain. If you decide to break these rules, be aware that the NPS rangers are not the only people looking for violations. Enough climbers want to see Denali kept pristine that they will not hesitate to snitch on violators.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_31\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Fuel&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;br&gt;White gas is available in Talkeetna, as well as a limited supply of butane/propane canisters. Other bottled fuels are available in Anchorage. Contact your air service operator before purchasing white gas, as they supply white gas in bulk to the Kahiltna Base Camp. Fuel cans distributed from the Kahiltna Basecamp will be marked with the expedition\'s permit number and you will likely get checked at some point to make sure you aren\'t using fuel that doesn\'t belong to you or if you have discarded a fuel can on the mountain (and didn\'t pack it out).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_32\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h3&gt;NPS/Rangers&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;br&gt;In 1977, the National Park Service established a ranger station specifically for mountaineers in Talkeetna. Since 1984, the station has been staffed year-round to provide information and assistance to mountaineers before, during and after their climbs. The mountaineering rangers have extensive experience in the Alaska Range and can provide invaluable information. The station maintains a reference library including a complete set of American Alpine Journals, a map collection, and specific route information for numerous other peaks, including the Ruth, Kitchatnas and Little Switzerland. You must check in at the Talkeetna Ranger Station before departing for Base Camp and check out when you leave the mountain. The park rangers will question you about your mountaineering experience and strongly discourage you from going if they feel your experience is insufficient. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Talkeetna Ranger Station&lt;br&gt;P.O.

In the end, if your situation is an emergency and the NPS is able to help, they will. However, they undertake rescue missions at thier discretion and with rescuer safety as the highest priority. The National Park Service does not have a policy to charge climbers for rescue services, however, any hospital, air ambulance or other associated costs after leaving the mountain are the sole responsibility of the climber. Rescue insurance or health insurance (if your rescue is a medical emergency) can help with the costs of the rescue. Cell phones work well above 14,200 feet. Some climbers will bring transistor radios to catch radio stations from Anchorage. FRS (Family Radio Service) radios are recommended for on-mountain communication. FRS channel 1 is monitored for emergencies. CBs are no longer monitored. Satellite phones are also encouraged.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In the autumn of 2011, a new 501(c)(3) non-profit organization was launched to help support the mountaineering Volunteers-in-Parks (VIP) program at Denali National Park and Preserve. The organization is the brainchild of Jen Latham, a Denali mountaineering volunteer and the wife of one of Denali\'s mountaineering rangers, Brandon Latham. Denali Rescue Volunteers is modeled after the successful \"Friends of Yosemite Search and Rescue\" or Friends of YOSAR program at Yosemite National Park. The mission of Denali Rescue Volunteers is to provide ancillary support to the volunteers of the mountaineering program of Denali National Park. Donations, both financial and \'in-kind\', will be used for:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt; Travel and equipment stipends for current volunteers.&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt; A gear/equipment cache for future volunteers.&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt; Stipends for current volunteers to attend medical and technical trainings.&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt; Creating and maintaining the Denali Rescue Volunteers website at &lt;a href=\"http://www.denalirescue.com.\"&gt;www.denalirescue.com.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Donations are administered through an independent board. The board of Denali Rescue Volunteers is made up of present and former volunteers, as well as advisors who have worked in and around Denali National Park as medical professionals and rescue personnel. No donation is used to directly support the rescue operations. The costs associated with missions are covered through funding appropriated to the NPS Washington, DC office.

It\'s broken down as follows (and please remember people, it\'s an &lt;i&gt;estimate&lt;/i&gt;):&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;Round trip flight to Anchorage from continental US: $500&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;Bag fees (coming/going): $200&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;Accomidation in Anchorage (2 nights, coming/going): $300&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;Transport to/from Talkeetna: $150&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;Accomidation in Talkeetna (2 nights, coming/going): $150&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;Food and drinks before and after the mountain: $200&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;Air Taxi flight: $500&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;Permits: $360&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;Food on the mountain (assumes three meals/day for 21 days + snacks): $500-750&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;Fuel on the mountain: $50&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;Misc expenses (taxis, tips, drinking, bad decisions, etc): $300&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;*and remember, this assumes you have all the gear and it\'s all in working order!&lt;a name=\"chapter_35\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Gear&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_36\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Sample Gear List&lt;/h3&gt;- Source: American Alpine Institute &lt;a href=\"http://www.alpineinstitute.com/media/36301/west_buttress_equipment.pdf\"&gt;website&lt;/a&gt; (as of 12/2012)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;&bull; Outerwear&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Base Layer Top:&lt;/b&gt; Bring two. This will be your base layer and should be lightweight or silk weight synthetic or wool. Bring at least one that is white or light in color for use on the lower glacier (reflects sunlight as opposed to absorbing it). Synthetic and wool only, no cotton.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Base Layer Bottom:&lt;/b&gt; Look for the same features as your Base Layer Top. One pair is usually sufficient.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Undergarments:&lt;/b&gt; Also known as underwear, most climbers wear them underneath their base layer. 1-3 pairs depending on personal preference for changing.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;2nd Layer Top:&lt;/b&gt; A lightweight fleece or wind shirt. A chest pocket is a helpful feature of this multi-use layer.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Expedition Weight Bottoms:&lt;/b&gt; A thicker pair of long underwear bottoms that will serve as an additional insulating layer for use in colder temperatures. This layer will go on top of your base layer, but under your softshell pants. One-piece suits (Farmer-John/Union Suit) are popular but require more planning and effort when answering the call of nature and work best with other layers designed for using the bathroom without removing layers. Windproof/Windstopper pants are heavier and less functional and will not work for this layer.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Soft Shell Jacket:&lt;/b&gt; Thin, light, stretchy, breathable but wind and snow-resistant layer that is comfortable to wear is ideal. This will be your action layer and the outer layer that you spend the most time in. Hoods are optional but highly recommended. Size your jacket to be trim fitting, but large enough to fit over your base and second layers. Light to moderate insulation/thickness is recommended. This layer will go over your base and expedition layers, but under your shell and parka if wearing this layer in combination with those layers.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Soft Shell Pants:&lt;/b&gt; Look for the same features as your Soft Shell Jacket. This will be your outermost layer most of the time for your legs. A thigh pocket is a useful feature for storing small items. Your base and expedition weight layers need to fit under these pants comfortably.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Light Insulating Layer, Top:&lt;/b&gt; The goal for this piece is to add warmth to your internal layering system. Depending on your clothing system, and the environment you are in, you may fit this layer underneath your shell gear (e.g. fleece sweaters) or over your shell gear (lightweight insulated jackets). If choosing fleece, pick modern fleece garments with waffle-grid patterns and avoid windproof fleece &ndash; it is not breathable enough. The weight and design of this piece will vary based on the other items of climbing that you are bringing. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Parka (Expedition Weight w/ Hood):&lt;/b&gt; These jackets come in many shapes, sizes and temperature ratings. If you tend to get cold easily, opt for a slightly warmer and more substantial parka. Otherwise, choose a lightweight down parka that is still baffled, includes a hood, and offers sufficient coverage over your waist.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Insulated Pants:&lt;/b&gt; Sized to fit over your soft shell pants and long underwear layers on the bottom, these pants are the last line of defense in extremely cold temperatures. Hip to full-length side-zips are a critical feature. Fleece is undesirable because it picks up snow, is bulky, and low-loft with respect to its weight. Down or synthetic fill pants are preferred and lighter weight, but require more care to not get them wet and/or frozen. The warmth of this layer will vary based on the temperatures expected at the time of your trip.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Shell Pants:&lt;/b&gt; Made of a waterproof/breathable material, your lightweight shell bottoms must have full or hip-length side zips. This garment should be extremely lightweight and packable. A zipper fly is a nice, but optional.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Shell Jacket:&lt;/b&gt; This layer needs to be made of waterproof/breathable construction and ultra-light. Your shell should be sized to comfortably fit over your other base and mid-layers (minus your parka). Choose the lightest, most packable shell that will still get the job done. Avoid extra pockets (one or two chest pockets is all you need), 3-layer Gore-Tex, and hanging linings. Your hood should fit over your climbing helmet (if you plan on bringing one &ndash; i.e. non-West Buttress routes).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&bull; Head/Hand/Footwear&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Socks:&lt;/b&gt; Bring three complete changes, more if you know you have very sweaty feet. If you plan to wear 8000 meter boots or Intuition liners, bring several light to mid-weight socks and one pair of heavy/warm socks. Adjust your sock system ahead of time to perfect your boot fit.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Gaiters:&lt;/b&gt; Knee height is required. Check the fit of the gaiter to your boot in advance to make sure the coverage is adequate. Not required for those with integrated boots.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&g'),(6,150221,'/white-mountain-peak/150221','/inyo-white-mountains/171605','White Mountain Peak','','','','14246','',190618,37.6344,-118.255,'California, United States, North America','','',171605,'Inyo-White Mountains','','','','','','Mountain-Rock','content: &lt;article&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_1\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2 id=\"first_h2\"&gt;Overview&lt;/h2&gt;White Mountain Peak, located northeast of the city of Bishop on US-395, is the third highest peak in California and the highest outside of the Sierra Nevada. It is part of the Inyo-White Mountains which are composed of some of the oldest sedimentary rocks in California with fossils nearly 600 million years old. The White and Inyo Mountains to the south are in the rain shadow of the Sierra Nevada which creates a striking desert-like appearance and the perfect conditions for the world\'s oldest living trees, the Ancient Bristlecone Pines. Methuselah, the oldest of these trees, is over 4,700 years old and tree-rings have been used to create a record dating back over 8,600 years. These trees are viewable off of White Mountain Road (see below). The summit provides excellent views of the Eastern Sierra Nevada as well as Owens Valley.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The 7-mile South Face route (class 1) is the most popular one and follows a 4WD road to the summit making it the easiest route to the summit of any California 14er, a fact supported by the many mountain bike and now &lt;a href=\"http://www.summitpost.com/mountains/photo_link.pl?photo_id=4330&amp;amp;object_id=38&amp;amp;type=mountain&amp;amp;mountain_id=38&amp;amp;route_id=\"&gt;unicycle ascents&lt;/a&gt;. The trailhead is the Barcroft gate at 12,000\' making for a gentle ascent. A more challenging route is the 10-mile class 2 West Ridge Route (9,000 foot elevation gain) which may be gained from Jeffery Mine or Milner Canyons (See &lt;a href=\"http://angeles.sierraclub.org/peaks/dps/archives/dps00762.htm\"&gt;Erik Siering\'s June 3, 2000 DPS Trip Report&lt;/a&gt;). Non-winter ascents generally take several hours to a day, however, many beginners underestimate the need to acclimatize.&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;table class=\"inline_image_thumbs\"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=139\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/139.JPG\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=37016\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/37016.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=1996\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/1996.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=17732\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/17732.JPG\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=22032\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/22032.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_2\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Getting There&lt;/h2&gt;SOUTH FACE FROM CALIFORNIA: The trailhead for this route is the Barcroft gate on White Mountain Road. From California\'s Owens Valley, take US-395 to Big Pine and drive east on California Highway SR-168 into the White Mountains. In 13 miles you will reach Westgard Pass and the junction with White Mountain Road. Turn north (left) on to White Mountain Road and drive north until you reach the Barcroft gate, driving past Schulman Grove, Crooked Creek, and Patriarch Grove. The pavement ends just after Schulman Grove (about 9.5 miles from Westgard Pass), and is replaced by a gravel 4WD road for the remaining 17 miles.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Although a high ground clearance 4WD vehicle isn\'t strictly necessary for this last portion of the road, they certainly make life go much faster. Low ground clearance cars, e.g. Acura Integra, have been known to take \"at least an hour\" for the last 17 miles (ref: &lt;a href=\"http://www.summitpost.com/mountains/user_link.pl?user_id=377\"&gt;2ndage&lt;/a&gt;) while Toyota Tundra trucks with the TRD Off-Road Package have been known to tear up the road at 40+ mph. Also see the reference to the VW Passat in the June 16, 2001 summit log.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;SOUTH FACE FROM NEVADA: Connect with California Highway SR-168 west off of Nevada Highway SR-266 at the town of Oasis. Drive over Gilbert Pass and into Deep Springs Valley before arriving at Westgard Pass and the marked intersection with White Mountain Road. Take this north and follow the directions above (from California).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;ROAD MAPS:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://www.wmrs.edu/travel/area%20map.htm\"&gt;UC WMRS Road Access Relief Map&lt;/a&gt;: including US-395, Bishop, Big Pine, SR-168, White Mountain Road, and Barcroft gate.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;!--&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://www.gorp.com/gifs/states/ca/bristlec.gif\"&gt;GORP\'s Detailed White Mountain Road Map&lt;/a&gt;: including SR-168, Ancient Bristlecone Pines, Barcroft gate (aka \"Locked Gate\"), and White Mountain Peak summit. --&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;table class=\"inline_image_thumbs\"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=30384\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/30384.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=18065\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/18065.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=30383\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/30383.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=30386\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/30386.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=3947\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/3947.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_3\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Red Tape&lt;/h2&gt;No permits or entry fees are required to climb, hike, ski, or mountain bike this peak.&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;table class=\"inline_image_thumbs\"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=136278\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/136278.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=136277\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/136277.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=136272\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/136272.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=136276\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/136276.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_4\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;When To Climb&lt;/h2&gt;Generally, people climb June to October, but ascents are possible year round. White Mountain Road and others are not plowed during the winter and may be gated when blocked by snow. If you choose to do the South Face when the road is blocked with snow, it\'s an additional ~26.5 mile ski approach to Barcroft Gate for the final 7 miles to the summit. Contact the White Mountain Ranger Station (see the Mountain Conditions section below) for the latest weather and road conditions.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Winter condition notes from &lt;a href=\"/mountains/user_link.pl?user_id=18795\"&gt;smeek12&lt;/a&gt;: I just got back from White Mountain, March 30th (2004), and the total round trip distance for the South side was 52 miles, even though the rangers told me 44. Also, pay close attention to the roads-the signs are terrible and are often contradictory to each other. I would\'ve gotten lost if I didn\'t have my GPS. I also climbed the west ridge last February, and it cost me a full day to figure out where to start-all maps I have seen are outdated. Updated maps of the dirt roads can be found at a restaurant/convenience store in the town of Chalfant. I didn\'t catch the name of this store, but the town is very small, and the store is on the north end of town on the east side of the 6.&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;table class=\"inline_image_thumbs\"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=97746\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/97746.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=70251\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/70251.JPG\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_5\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Camping&lt;/h2&gt;Due to the high summit elevation, many people coming from Owens Valley like to spend a night sleeping at high enough elevation to properly acclimatize. While there are restrictions against camping (and stove use outside of vehicles) within the boundaries of the Ancient Bristlecone Pine Forest straddling White Mountain Road, camping is allowed outside of the this area with a campfire permit that is available from USFS field staff and ranger stations (see Mountain Conditions below for contact info). Some popular options for those using the South Face route include:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Barcroft gate trailhead (12,000\'): There is space to pitch a tent and a couple of fire rings. No reservations are needed for camping but a campfire permit is required and available from USFS office in Bishop.

This also means there are no trees or other natural barriers to block the wind. You should be prepared for a windy day any day and although it doesn\'t rain much, people have been known to get caught in rain and lightning. Also be prepared for sudden snow storms beginning in October.

Nobody should take this road. I took this road going down from White Mountain. It was an absolute pain. I have no idea as how would someone drive up this road. You must be a very good driver. Going down, the first 5-6 miles are absolutely horrendous. At one point, in a hairpin left turn driving down, the car slid to the right although I was barely moving. I thought I was a gonner. From mile 6 to 10 the road is so-so. After that, to the main street, it is in good condition. I see how someone would get tricked into driving up this road believing it is a good option. That until reaching a point where is probably impossible to turn around. Time-wise it took me to drive down as much as it took me to drive up on the main access road by Ancient Bristlecone Forest. The Silver Canyon road is only 15 miles, but there is no time savings. It would also be very dangerous if not impossible to drive, either up or down, on a sedan. You mention the water crossings but to me they were the least of the worries.&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td valign=\"bottom\" style=\"padding-top: 6px;\" colspan=\"2\"&gt;&lt;span style=\"font-size: 9px; color: #888;\"&gt;Posted Sep 20, 2014 4:23 pm&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;table border=\"0\" width=\"775\" class=\"messages\"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td width=\"110\" align=\"left\" valign=\"top\" style=\"padding-top: 6px;\"&gt;&lt;a name=\"485623\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a class=\"dis_user_lnk\" href=\"/users/lindakimble/122240\"&gt;lindakimble&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td valign=\"top\" style=\"padding-top: 6px;\"&gt;&lt;b&gt;White Mountain Notes&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td align=\"right\" valign=\"top\" nowrap style=\"font-size: 10px;\"&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td valign=\"top\" rowspan=\"2\" align=\"left\" style=\"padding-top: 6px;\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=\"font-size: 9px; color: #888;\"&gt;Hasn\'t voted&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td colspan=\"2\" style=\"padding-top: 6px;\"&gt;OK, when you read the note that White Mountain Road is much better than the alternative, just realize that White Mountain Road is still pretty bad. This \"gravel\" road is really just a rocky, dirt road. Take a truck or SUV with a tall profile to traverse this road. While we saw people going really fast on this road, we also saw the same people destroy their tire and get a flat. We took it at 10 miles an hour, and it took 1.5 hours each way to traverse the dirt section alone. If you plan to take this road easy for your car\'s sake, add 2 to 2.5 hours time to get to the trailhead from civilization.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;We agree this is an \"easy 14er\" but that does not mean it was easy. We are seasoned hikers with a lot of high altitude experience and were plenty tired by the end of the day. This may be due in part to the quick elevation gain you get from driving up. Acclimating would have helped.&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td valign=\"bottom\" style=\"padding-top: 6px;\" colspan=\"2\"&gt;&lt;span style=\"font-size: 9px; color: #888;\"&gt;Posted Sep 1, 2014 3:11 pm&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;table border=\"0\" width=\"775\"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;table cellpadding=\"2\" cellspacing=\"2\" width=\"100%\"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;&lt;span class=\"pagertext\"&gt;Viewing: &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;-&lt;b&gt;4&lt;/b&gt; of &lt;b&gt;4&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td align=\"center\"&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td align=\"right\"&gt;    &lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_10\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Images&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div align=\"center\"&gt;&lt;table id=\"my_images\"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/bristlecone-pines-the-world-s-oldest-living-thing/136304/c-150221\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Bristlecone Pines: the world\\\'s oldest living thing.\" src=\"/images/square/136304.JPG\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/bristlecone-pine-in-black-white/224986/c-150221\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Bristlecone Pine in Black &amp;amp; White\" src=\"/images/square/224986.JPG\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/many-colors-of-white-mountain-peak/207756/c-150221\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Many colors of White Mountain Peak\" src=\"/images/square/207756.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/another-evening-in-sierra/129801/c-150221\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Another evening in Sierra...\" src=\"/images/square/129801.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/white-mountain-peak-on-the-road-to-dyer-nevada/267358/c-150221\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"White Mountain Peak on the road to Dyer, Nevada\" src=\"/images/square/267358.JPG\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/bristlecone-pine-snag/336300/c-150221\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Bristlecone Pine Snag\" src=\"/images/square/336300.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/white-mountain-peak-from-the/37016/c-150221\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"White Mountain Peak from the...\" src=\"/images/square/37016.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/my-friend-bob-hiking-in-the-white-mtns/225478/c-150221\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"My friend Bob hiking in the White Mtns\" src=\"/images/square/225478.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/white-mtn-peak-from-rattlesnake-mtn/487063/c-150221\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"White Mtn.

It was the last one to be climbed (August 1931). None of the routes are easy and the summit block - where the register is placed is rated - 5.8-5.9.  Located on the main Palisade Crest, it is the northernmost fourteen thousander in the Sierra Nevada.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This is a pretty awesome peak, with a beautiful and difficult summit monolith. The views from the summit are incredible - towards North Palisade and Mount Sill on one side, towards Mount Winchell on the other, and toward Kings Canyon to the West.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The mountain got its name from the circumstances of the first ascent. A bolt of lightning hit the summit monolith just as Jules Eichorn was coming down from it. In an interview in 1989, when he was asked how close the thunder fell, he said \"...just past my right ear\".

The latter is shorter and involves less elevation gain, as you start from 10,000f t. However, it contains a longer cross country portion skirting Mount Winchell, and that can get tricky if you drop too low in the talus below Thunderbolt Pass. Moreover, the South Lake approach gives you access to West side routes which are less technical and where the rock is much more loose. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;'),(8,150227,'/mount-whitney/150227','/john-muir-wilderness/170988','Mount Whitney','','','','14505','',679830,36.5786,-118.293,'California, United States, North America','','',170988,'John Muir Wilderness','','','','','','Mountain-Rock','content: &lt;article&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_1\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2 id=\"first_h2\"&gt;Overview&lt;/h2&gt;Mount Whitney, of the California Sierra Nevada, holds numerous distinctions. It is the highpoint of both Tulare &amp;amp; Inyo counties. It is the highest peak in the Sierra, &amp;amp; indeed in all of California. Finally, it rises higher than any piece of land in the United States outside of Alaska. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Mount Whitney\'s elevation stature continues to intrigue the human psyche, both from a civilian as well as a governmental perspective. Its elevation seems to be continually evaluated and reevaluated using the newest technologies, perpetually changing (usually in an upward trend) the mountain\'s height. The NPS plaque on the mountain lists Whitney\'s official height at 14,496.811 feet. &lt;a href=\"http://www.ngs.noaa.gov/cgi-bin/ds_mark.prl?PidBox=GT1811\"&gt;The most recent observations&lt;/a&gt; by NGS (National Geodetic Survey)/NOAA (National Oceanographic &amp;amp; Atmospheric Administration) put it at 14,505\' (4,421m)- thanks &lt;a href=\"http://www.summitpost.org/user_page.php?user_id=28054\"&gt;Eleutheros&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;All this being said, it is still no 5,000m (let alone 6,000 or 7,000m) peak. It would be a minor (if somewhat steep on certain aspects) foothill in any of the Earth&rsquo;s great ranges. It harbors no glaciers. A huge number of people, possessing little wilderness skills or technical expertise, manage to run, hike, &amp;amp;/or crawl their way to the top of this large piece of exposed granite each year via the uninspiring Mt. Whitney trail. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The attributes which make Mt. Whitney a truly great mountain are frequently overlooked. History, commanding position, excellent rock, its great east face &amp;amp; &lsquo;subsidiary&rsquo; needles, &amp;amp; a tantalizing selection of routes are arguably the bread &amp;amp; butter of Mt. Whitney. During the winter months, delightful opportunities also exist for the ski mountaineer / backcountry snowboarder.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;While its gentle western slopes would hardly inspire the hardened mountaineer, Whitney&rsquo;s east face, erupting 2,000 ft. above cold &amp;amp; serene Iceberg Lake, draws the climber&rsquo;s eye upward &amp;amp; makes them yearn. Whitney&rsquo;s subsidiary needles, (to the south of the main east face), are awe-inspiring enough by themselves, &amp;amp; have their own epics, legends, &amp;amp; lore firmly established. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The proximity of the highest point in the continental US with the lowest point in North America has not escaped notice. The &lt;a href=\"http://www.badwater.com/\"&gt;Badwater Ultramarathon,&lt;/a&gt; begun officially in 1987, takes some of the most masochistic individuals imaginable from Badwater (Death Valley) to the lofty summit of Mt. Whitney. Before this was &lsquo;en vogue,&rsquo; Stan Rodefer and Jim Burnworth of San Diego became the first people to do the Badwater/Whitney (Lowest/Highest) hike in recorded history, in October 1969. They took 2 weeks, crossed the dreaded salt flats and hiked a direct route not using roads or any other conveniences (this was documented by the Park Rangers and in a November 4, 1969 San Diego Tribune article entitled \"Hikers View High, Low Sites in the U.S.&rdquo;). Props. Ouch.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;  The 11-mile &lt;a href=\"/mountains/route_link.pl/route_id/558/object_id/45\"&gt;Mount Whitney Trail&lt;/a&gt; (class 1) is the easiest and most popular route to the summit and is often done as a strenuous 22-mile day hike. During the summer and autumn months, only sneakers are necessary to ascend this summit from the Whitney Portal trailhead at 8,365 feet, however, earlier in the season, an ice axe and crampons may be required. Many people will appreciate taking two days to do this hike, spending a night at Outpost Camp or Trail Camp. An interesting time to visit is the month of April, before the quota season starts, when the snowpack is firmer and Trail Camp becomes a base camp for groups hanging out in the winter alpine scenery using their 2-way radios to talk to those above Trail Crest.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;  While there are many other routes on Whitney, the most popular ones after the main trail include: the &lt;a href=\"/mountains/route_link.pl/route_id/70/object_id/45\"&gt;Mountaineer\'s Route&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"/mountains/route_link.pl/route_id/245/object_id/45\"&gt;East Face&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"/mountains/route_link.pl/route_id/251/object_id/45\"&gt;East Buttress&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"http://www.summitpost.org/image/44615/160322/north-face.html\"&gt;North Slope&lt;/a&gt;. The first three of these start from Iceberg Lake while the last one is often climbed as a traverse from &lt;a href=\"/mountains/mountain_link.pl/mountain_id/383\"&gt;Mount Russell&lt;/a&gt;. Winter makes the Mountaineer\'s Route a popular objective. The East Face &amp;amp; East Buttress are the classic technical climbs on the peak.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;  For a discussion on winter climbing, see the \"When To Climb, Ski, etc.\" section below.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;table border=\"1\" cellspacing=\"0\"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;table border=\"0\" cellspacing=\"2\" cellpadding=\"1\"&gt;&lt;tr bgcolor=\"#c0c0c0\"&gt;&lt;td colspan=\"5\"&gt;&lt;font style=\"font-weight: bold;\"&gt;Routes Overview&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr bgcolor=\"#ffffff\"&gt;&lt;td align=\"center\" colspan=\"2\"&gt;&lt;font style=\"font-weight: bold;\"&gt;Route Name&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/td&gt;  &lt;td align=\"center\"&gt;&lt;font style=\"font-weight: bold;\"&gt;Difficulty&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/td&gt;  &lt;td align=\"center\"&gt;&lt;font style=\"font-weight: bold;\"&gt;FA&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/td&gt;  &lt;td align=\"center\"&gt;&lt;font style=\"font-weight: bold;\"&gt;FA Party&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/td&gt;  &lt;/tr&gt;    &lt;tr&gt;  &lt;td bgcolor=\"#e0e0e0\" colspan=\"2\"&gt;Cardiovascular Seizure&lt;/td&gt;  &lt;td bgcolor=\"#e0e0e0\" align=\"center\"&gt;III 5.10&lt;/td&gt;  &lt;td bgcolor=\"#e0e0e0\" align=\"center\"&gt;1973&lt;/td&gt;  &lt;td bgcolor=\"#e0e0e0\"&gt;Vern Clevenger &amp;amp; Keith Bell&lt;/td&gt;  &lt;/tr&gt;    &lt;tr&gt;  &lt;td colspan=\"2\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"/mountains/route_link.pl/route_id/251/object_id/45\"&gt;East Buttress &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;  &lt;td align=\"center\"&gt;III 5.8&lt;/td&gt;  &lt;td align=\"center\"&gt;1937&lt;/td&gt;  &lt;td&gt;Bob Brinton, Glen Dawson, Richard Jones, Howard Koster, &amp;amp; Muir Dawson&lt;/td&gt;  &lt;/tr&gt;    &lt;tr&gt;  &lt;td bgcolor=\"#e0e0e0\" colspan=\"2\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"/mountains/route_link.pl/route_id/245/object_id/45\"&gt;East Face&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;  &lt;td bgcolor=\"#e0e0e0\" align=\"center\"&gt;III 5.6&lt;/td&gt;  &lt;td bgcolor=\"#e0e0e0\" align=\"center\"&gt;1931&lt;/td&gt;  &lt;td bgcolor=\"#e0e0e0\"&gt;Robert Underhill, Glen Dawson, Jules Eichorn, &amp;amp; Norman Clyde&lt;/td&gt;  &lt;/tr&gt;    &lt;tr&gt;  &lt;td width=\"15\"&gt;&lt;/td&gt;  &lt;td&gt;Direct Crack Variation&lt;/td&gt;  &lt;td align=\"center\"&gt;5.8&lt;/td&gt;  &lt;td align=\"center\"&gt;1953&lt;/td&gt;  &lt;td&gt;John Medenhall&lt;/td&gt;  &lt;/tr&gt;    &lt;tr&gt;  &lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;  &lt;td bgcolor=\"#e0e0e0\"&gt;McKusky Variation&lt;/td&gt;  &lt;td bgcolor=\"#e0e0e0\" align=\"center\"&gt;5.6&lt;/td&gt;  &lt;td bgcolor=\"#e0e0e0\" align=\"center\"&gt;1996&lt;/td&gt;  &lt;td bgcolor=\"#e0e0e0\"&gt;Patrick McKusky, Tony Padilla, &amp;amp; Jeremy Georgelos&lt;/td&gt;  &lt;/tr&gt;    &lt;tr&gt;  &lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;  &lt;td&gt;Shaky-Leg Crack Variation&lt;/td&gt;  &lt;td align=\"center\"&gt;5.7&lt;/td&gt;  &lt;td align=\"center\"&gt;1936&lt;/td&gt;  &lt;td&gt;Morgan Harris, James N.

Take US-395 to Lone Pine and then turn west on Whitney Portal Road. In 13 miles, you will reach Whitney Portal at an elevation of 8,365 feet. Bears have been known to frequent this trailhead so do not leave food in your car during bear season - there\'s a reason why all the garbage cans are bear-proofed. During winter, the last 6 miles of this road are not plowed.  &lt;p&gt;  ONION VALLEY: This is primarily a backpacking approach using the Onion Valley traihead reaching Trail Crest in 36.1 miles. The first 7.4 miles cross Kearsarge Pass on the Sierra Crest and bring you to the John Muir Trail (JMT) / Pacific Crest Trail (PCT) where you head south crossing Forester Pass (13180\') en route to Mount Whitney via the JMT. You can also bypass Trail Crest on your ascent climbing Mount Whitney\'s western slopes with a possible camp at Arctic Lake. From &lt;a href=\"http://www.summitpost.com/mountains/user_link.pl?user_id=1243\"&gt;norbertc&lt;/a&gt;: \"Advantages: no crowds, gorgeous scenery along the John Muir trail; no problem getting a last-minute trail permit at Whitney Portal; this is a circuit loop, so when you descend Whitney on the west face you are on that trail for the first time\" if you bypass Trail Crest on the ascent. To reach Onion Valley, turn west on US-395 at Independence, north of Lone Pine.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;  OTHER APPROACHS: In addition to Onion Valley, there are numerous other approaches including Horseshow Meadows typically used for &lt;a href=\"http://www.summitpost.com/mountains/mountain_link.pl/mountain_id/64\"&gt;Mount Langley&lt;/a&gt; (Ref: &lt;a href=\"http://www.summitpost.com/mountains/user_link.pl?user_id=462\"&gt;gordonye&lt;/a&gt;). While these other approaches are interesting for backpackers, climbers will usually be interested in a more direct approach. While one may be tempted to bypass the trail quota when using a trailhead other than Whitney Portal, the Whitney Zone covers a large amount of land to the west of Mount Whitney as well, so although this area may not be patrolled by rangers as rigorously, a permit is still required.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;table class=\"inline_image_thumbs\"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=38343\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/38343.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=13784\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/13784.JPG\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=13785\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/13785.JPG\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=97303\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/97303.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=5554\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/5554.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_3\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Red Tape&lt;/h2&gt;Permits are required year-round, however, a quota is in place for the Mount Whitney Zone from May 1 to November 1 depending whether you are on the Mount Whitney Trial or others, e.g. the Mountaineer\'s Route (differences described below). Permit information is available on the &lt;a href=\"http://www.fs.fed.us/r5/inyo/recreation/wild/mtwhitney.shtml\"&gt;Inyo National Forest page&lt;/a&gt;.  During other times, a self-issued wilderness permit is required which can be made at the Mount Whitney Ranger Station in Lone Pine, not at Whitney Portal (see Mountain Conditions section below for the ranger station address). You can also check the &lt;a href=\"http://www.whitneyportalstore.com\"&gt;Whitney Portal Store&lt;/a&gt; Message Board for people who have extra openings on their permits.  &lt;p&gt;  MOUNT WHITNEY TRAIL: Between May 1 and November 1, there is a quota of 60 overnight hikers and 100 day hikers in effect. 100% of these permits are made available via advanced reservations made during February of the same year (reservations accepted by mail or fax), however permit processing does not begin until February 15. These get taken quickly for weekends and overnights, however, weekday quotas often are not filled. For open slots, permit requests can be made after May 1 (reservations accepted by mail, fax, or phone). Reservations cost $15/person, however, walk-in permits, if any are available, are free. There is now also an explicit \"Trail Crest\" Exit permit/quota for people who just use the Whitney Trail as a descent route, say for the Mountaineers Route. Luckily for those of us who don\'t want to bother with quotas, travel between November 2 and April 30 requires only a self-issued wilderness permit. Let\'s hope it stays that way.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;  OTHER MOUNT WHITNEY ZONE TRAILS (INCL. MOUNTAINEER\'S ROUTE): All other trails in the Mount Whitney Zone are also subject to overnight and day quotas between May 1 and November 1, however, only 60% are available via advanced registration with 40% reserved for walk-ins. For the North Fork of Lone Pine Creek (aka Mountaineer\'s Route), only 10 permits per day are currently available, 6 reservable, and 4 for walk-ins). Use self-issued permits at other times.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;table class=\"inline_image_thumbs\"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=30612\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/30612.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=33552\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/33552.JPG\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=94952\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/94952.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=94953\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/94953.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=50821\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/50821.JPG\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_4\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;When To Climb, Ski, etc.&lt;/h2&gt;Mount Whitney is a year-round mountain. Between late May and October, hiking/running the Mount Whitney Trail and climbing on the Mountaineer\'s Route are popular. Then activity generally slackens during the next few months while the snow pack accumulates until the February to early May season when ski mountaineering, backcountry snowboarding, and general mountaineering on routes such as the Mountaineer\'s Route and the North Face are popular. Mountaineering on the Mount Whitney Trail is also very popular but generally there is not enough good snow above Trail Crest to make this worthy for skiing or boarding.  &lt;p&gt;  &lt;b&gt;WINTER CONSIDERATIONS&lt;/b&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;  While winters in the Sierra are relatively mild, compared to say New Hampshire\'s &lt;a href=\"http://www.summitpost.com/mountains/mountain_link.pl?mountain_id=66\"&gt;Mount Washington&lt;/a&gt; and Presidential Range, there are some things to consider:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;u&gt;Climbing Gear&lt;/u&gt;: Generally snowshoes, crampons, and an mountaineering axe are required. Expect to use snowshoes on the lower portions of the trail through March/April as you may encounter several feet of fresh snow along the trail, however they may no longer be necessary by late April to May. On the Whitney Trail expect to change over to crampons and axe by the time you hit Trail Crest and above though windpacked snow should begin just above Bighorn Park (outside of the trees). On the Mountaineers Route, you will need an axe and crampons above the notch. Often times rope is used on the last section of the Mountaineers Route to gain the Whitney Plateau.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;u&gt;Sleeping Gear&lt;/u&gt; (Mostly Ref: &lt;a href=\"http://www.summitpost.com/mountains/user_link.pl/user_id/718\"&gt;Gonekuku&lt;/a&gt;): Given the Sierra\'s generally mild weather, you should be fine preparing for a -20&deg;F night though some people go as light as 0&deg;F. Night temps at 12,000\' can range from 5&deg;F to -10&deg;F. It\'s useful to use the \"aviation rule\" for temperatures: \"You lose about 3.6&deg;F per 1,000 feet gained. If it\'s 40&deg;F low at Lone Pine, it\'s about 36&deg;F colder on the summit of Whitney that night. (about 7&deg;F at trail camp).\" Day temps at Outpost Camp have been reported in the 8-9&deg;F range.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;u&gt;Approach&lt;/u&gt;: During heavy snow, the Whitney Portal Road is closed at either at the Lone Pine Campground (5,900\') or the base of the mountain (6,600\'). There is no plowing beyond 6,600\' and people often park on the north side of the road here. If you take a 4WD vehicle past the plowed area, be aware that your vehicle can get stuck in snow storms or rock slides. During the winter, many groups make their first camp at Whitney Portal (8,365\').&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;u&gt;Avalanche Conditions&lt;/u&gt;: While the Whitney Trail does not have any recent history of avalanche danger, you should still check the CSAC Avalanche Bulletin (under Mountain Conditions section).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;table class=\"inline_image_thumbs\"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=13832\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/13832.JPG\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=13833\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/13833.JPG\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=13515\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/13515.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=13714\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/13714.JPG\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=132433\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/132433.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_5\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Camping&lt;/h2&gt;MOUNT WHITNEY TRAIL: The two popular campgrounds on this trail are Outpost Camp at 10,335\' and Trail Camp at 12,000\' at 3.8 and 6.2 miles from the trailhead respectively. Those feeling the effects of the altitude will want to stay at Outpost Camp, however, most people making a multi-day trip stay at Trail Camp. During \"bear season,\" you should be prepared for both bears and marmots. In recent years, bears have been known to make it up to Trail Camp so bear-resistant food containers are now required for overnight trips along the Mount Whitney Trail between May 25 and October 31.  If you do not have a bear-canister, rangers will ask you to \"leave the area.\"  As for marmots, you may want to keep your tent pinned down with rocks and leave it open along with your pack so they won\'t feel compelled to chew through your gear to satisfy their curiosity.  &lt;p&gt;  NORTH FORK OF LONE PINE CREEK: The popular campgrounds along this route are: Lower Boy Scout Lake (10,300\'), Upper Boy Scout Lake (11,350\'), and Iceberg Lake (12,600\'). Many parties climbing the &lt;a href=\"http://www.summitpost.com/mountains/route_link.pl/route_id/70/object_id/45\"&gt;Mountaineer\'s Route&lt;/a&gt; and other East Face routes in 2+ days will try to reach Iceberg Lake on the first day. All camping should be at least 100 feet from the lakes. Human waste should be buried 6-8 inches deep and at least 200 feet (70 paces) from any campsite and water source. Toilet paper should be packed out. According to the Inyo NF, \"Improper disposal of human waste at Iceberg Lake is a serious problem.\" Proper water treatment is probably a good idea here!&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;table class=\"inline_image_thumbs\"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=30525\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/30525.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=103686\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/103686.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=115153\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/115153.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=15959\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/15959.JPG\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=13717\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/13717.JPG\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://www.summitpost.org/a-beautiful-night-on-mount-whitney/768243\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"http://images.summitpost.org/thumb/768243.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_6\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Mountain Conditions&lt;/h2&gt;Use the following resources to check route and weather conditions on Mount Whitney:  &lt;p&gt;  &lt;a href=\"http://www.395.com/index.shtml?/weather/\"&gt;www.395.com&lt;/a&gt; - High Sierra Weather Report incl. satellite photo.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://www.wunderground.com/US/CA/Lone_Pine.html\"&gt;Weather Underground&lt;/a&gt; - Lonepine, CA Weather Forecast  &lt;br&gt;&lt;!--a href=\"http://www.whitneyportalstore.com/livecam.jpg\"&gt;Mount Whitney Skycam&lt;/a&gt; - Periodically updated.  &lt;br--&gt;  &lt;a href=\"http://www.whitneyportalstore.com/whitney-messageBoard.html\"&gt;Whitney Portal Store message board&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://www.csac.org/Bulletins/Calif/esierra.php\"&gt;CSAC Eastern Sierra Avalanche Bulletin&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;  MOUNT WHITNEY RANGER STATION&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;P.O.

Wonder who that old earthquake sharp thinks is running this country, anyhow? &lt;br&gt;-Inyo Independent, 20 September, 1873&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For years our chief, Professor Whitney has made brave campaigns into the unknown realm of Nature. Against low prejudice &amp;amp; dull indifference he has led the survey of California onward to success. There stand for him two monuments, - one a great report made by his own hand; another the loftiest peak in the Union, begun for him in the planet&rsquo;s youth &amp;amp; sculptured of enduring granite by the slow hand of Time.&lt;br&gt;-Clarence King&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The appellation of what is now known as Mt. Whitney stands as testimony to the rewards of shameless brown-nosing, before the United States Geological Survey (USGS) introduced &lt;a href=\"http://egsc.usgs.gov/isb/pubs/factsheets/fs15899.html#policy\"&gt;naming guidelines&lt;/a&gt; designed to prevent such shameless &amp;amp; juvenile acts from occurring.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Despite &lt;a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clarence_King\"&gt;Clarence King&lt;/a&gt;\'s amusing inability to be the first to scale this great peak (the highest in the contiguous United States, no doubt a large contributor to his desire to be the first ascentionist), his boss happened to be &lt;a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josiah_Whitney\"&gt;Josiah Whitney&lt;/a&gt; (1819-1896). Whitney happened to be chief of the California State Geological survey at the time.  As Whitney kept on approving the paperwork funding yet one failed expedition to summit the mountain after another for his obsessed henchman King, King felt compelled to express his gratitude in a meaningful manner. Mt. Whitney thus became Mt. Whitney after King &amp;amp; Richard Cotter dubbed it as such in July, 1864 (fittingly from the top of &lt;a href=\"http://www.summitpost.org/mountain/rock/150441/mount-tyndall.html\"&gt;Mt. Tyndall&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A person of modern times could not be blamed for being curious about how Joshiah Whitney became the state&rsquo;s head geologist (1864-1874), as well as professor of geology at Harvard (1869-1896). Whitney, despite his academic qualifications, held various misperceptions commonly known today to be falsities. He denied the possibility of any active glaciers remaining in the lower 48 states; ironically enough, King named one of the first documented glaciers that he &lsquo;discovered&rsquo; (&amp;amp; California&rsquo;s largest, on the northern flanks of Mt.

It is the southernmost fourteener, and the most desert-like of the Sierra Nevada fourteeners.

The other 40% (24) are for walk-in permits.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It costs $5.00 per person to reserve a permit in advance.  All other times of the year have no quota on trail users, but require a wilderness permit, which can be obtained free at the ranger station in Lone Pine.  The mountain is always open, but the road is not plowed during winter. For example, in 2002, the road opened in late April (some have been known to open up the gates and proceed up anyway, especially in low snow years like 2002 - however this is illegal).

Good mountaineering snow is present from May through July.  This peak can be snowshoed up in winter, but is very far, with the road not being plowed (see above for the road access conditions.

It also offers a great snow climb in winter and late spring.  It\'s location in the middle of the Wasatch range provides good views of surrounding peaks and mountain ranges.    &lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;table class=\"inline_image_thumbs\"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=117740\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/117740.JPG\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=13359\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/13359.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=127001\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/127001.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_2\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Getting There&lt;/h2&gt;From Interstate 215 southeast of downtown Salt Lake City, take the 6200 South Exit (Exit 6) Turn right (east).  6200 South turns into Wasatch Boulevard  Follow Wasatch Blvd to the mouth of Big Cottonwood Canyon  Signs point to the Brighton/Solitude ski resorts  Turn east (left) and measure from this point  Follow Big Cottonwood Canyon Road 4.2 miles to the Mill B South Trailhead  The trailhead is on the south (right) side of the road  Overflow parking is available along the road  Mill B South trailhead provides access to Lake Blanche and Broads Fork  &lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;table class=\"inline_image_thumbs\"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=112993\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/112993.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_3\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Broads Fork&lt;/h2&gt;From the west end of the Mill B South trailhead parking lot a sign marks the beginning of the Broads Fork trailhead.  The trail begins by heading west up the timbered slope.  After 0.25 miles the trail turns left and enters the Twin Peaks Wilderness area.  The trail continues climbing past a large rock on the the right (west), climbs over a small ridge and enters the Broads Fork drainage.  The trail levels off as it meanders southwest toward the stream.  A few yards short of the stream, the trail turns sharply left (south) and climbs steeply to the stream crossing for another 0.25 miles.  There is a sturdy, wood bridge that crosses the stream at 7200 feet and 1.25 miles from the trailhead.    After crossing the bridge to the west side of the stream, resume climbing south up the Broads Fork drainage.  The trail climbs past several small benches for 0.75 miles to reach the meadows at 8400 feet.  The trail is well-maintained and clearly distinct to the meadows.  A small spur branch of the trail veers to the right to reach the top of the knoll and provides and excellent view of Mount Dromedary, Sunrise Peak and Twin Peaks.  The main trail continues left and slightly east toward the stream.  Across the stream the trail is less distinct.  Depending upon the time of year and the previous year\'s snowpack, a choice to continue along the main trail or travel across consolidated snow can be made.  It is easier to take the right spur trail previous mentioned if the route over consolidated snow is chosen.  Both routes converge higher in the Broads Fork drainage.  Caution should be taken when traveling above the meadows in winter or late spring.  Several of the slopes are prone to avalanches.  Late spring climbs should not be attempted until the snow has broken from the east-facing slabs of Twin Peaks and ice axe and crampons are recommended.      After crossing the stream, the main trail contours east around a beaver pond.  Past the beaver pond the standard route climbs through the trees and continues climbing along the east side of the drainage into upper Broads Fork beneath the north face of Sunrise Peak.   Beneath the shadow of Sunrise&iexcl;&brvbar;s north face the route to Twin Peaks and Sunrise&iexcl;&brvbar;s west ridge turns southwest.  The route to Dromedary and Sunrise&iexcl;&brvbar;s east ridge turns left (east.)  Dromedary can be climbed from either the Dromedary/Sunrise saddle along the west ridge or from the east ridge and the Blanche Fork ridge.  Both routes are Class 3 and will be described.    From beneath the north face of Sunrise, the west route ascends loose scree or snow southeast toward the Sunrise/Dromedary saddle.  The slope is moderately steep and climbs steadily.  The route steepens to ascend the final 200 feet to the Dromedary/Sunrise saddle.  From the saddle descend south for 20-30 feet on the Little Cottonwood Canyon side of the ridge.  Contour slightly to the east.  Dromedary\'s summit is visible from this point.  Climb the most obvious gully on loose rock to the gain the ridge just west of the summit.  Scramble along the ridge a short distance to the summit on mostly Class 3 rock.    The standard route climbs under the north face of Dromedary to reach the east slope.  From the upper portion of Broads Fork at 9800 feet turn left (east) and aim for the northeast shoulder of Dromedary.  Climb loose scree and boulders or snow to reach the ridge between Broad&iexcl;&brvbar;s Fork and Blanche Fork about 200 feet north of the east slopes.  From the ridge climb south near the ridge.  Climb a short, steep section to reach the east-facing slopes.  The remainder of the route is visible from this point.  Climb broken ledges on gentle, sloping rock.  Care should be taken to stay left (south) along the east slope.  The ridge along the north is more difficult and exposed.  Climb a few hundred feet along Class 3 rock to reach the summit at 11,107 feet.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;table class=\"inline_image_thumbs\"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=13360\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/13360.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=13361\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/13361.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_4\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Red Tape&lt;/h2&gt;No permits or fees are rquired and camping is allowed within the Twin Peaks Wilderness area.

Winter ascents present avalanche danger and only experienced mountaineers should attempt the peak in winter.  Lake spring ascents are recommended once the snow has consolidated and the final snow has broken off the slabs east of Twin Peaks.  Crampons and ice axe are recommended for winter and late spring ascents.&lt;br&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_6\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Camping&lt;/h2&gt;Camping is allowed within the Twin Peaks Wilderness area.

It is the second highest peak in the park -- 51 feet higher than &lt;a href=\"http://www.summitpost.com/mountains/mountain_link.pl/mountain_id/477\"&gt;Kuna Peak&lt;/a&gt;, but 61 feet shy of &lt;a href=\"http://www.summitpost.com/mountains/mountain_link.pl/mountain_id/358\"&gt;Mount Lyell\'s&lt;/a&gt; glaciated summit.  Many factors contribute to make Mount Dana a popular climbing destination for mountaineers of all strains.  For one thing, it is very accessible:  the mountain is adjacent to a major highway (CA 120), and although the peak is high, the trailhead is high also (~10,000 feet).  It is also beautiful:  the summit views are panoramic and quite impressive, with vistas of alpine glaciers, innumerable rugged peaks, sub-alpine meadows, high desert valleys and perhaps most interesting, Mono Lake.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Mount Dana is also a justifiably popular backcountry skiing destination.  In mid-winter, access is difficult due to the closing of the Tioga Pass road (see \"Winter &amp;amp; Early Spring Access\" section below).  However, adventurous types can ski up Lee Vining Canyon, following the roadway, and set up a base camp near Tioga Pass.  Alternatively, the &lt;a href=\"http://www.tiogapassresort.com\"&gt;Tioga Pass Resort&lt;/a&gt; -- located just across highway 120 from Mount Dana -- offers rustic cabins in the dead of winter.  It ain\'t cheap, but they will haul your stuff up and provide you with a warm and comfortable base from which to explore the world class BC skiing in the Tioga Pass area.  When the road opens in the spring, that\'s when the action really gets going on Mount Dana, for the skiing is steep, scenic and easily accessed by car.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Mount Dana is an interesting mountain with many unique characteristics.  The peak rises gently out of Dana Meadows on its reddish, metamorphic west side.  And, like many peaks on the Sierra crest, Mount Dana\'s east side drops precipitously to the floor of the Owens Valley.  What makes Mount Dana somewhat unique is that this steep east side is pierced laterally by a large glacial cirque (\"Glacier Canyon\") that separates the main peak from the appropriately named Dana Plateau to the east.  Glacier Canyon is easily accessed from Tioga Pass, and is used to approach many popular climbing routes, including the Dana and Solstice Couloirs, and the east face.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The easiest route to the summit is is the NW Slope (or West Slope) Route.  This route starts at the Tioga Pass entrance station (9,941 ft; ca. 3000 meters), and is not technically difficult, but presents a reasonably strenuous half-day hike to the 13,053 ft summit.   Because Mount Dana is one of the more readily attained of the higher Yosemite summits (&lt;a href=\"http://www.summitpost.com/mountains/mountain_link.pl/mountain_id/304\"&gt;Mount Hoffman&lt;/a&gt; also falls into this category, although that peak is significantly lower than Dana), you can expect to have company on this mountain on pleasant June-October weekend days. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As noted, the Dana Plateau is a broad and rocky bench across Glacier Canyon from the summit.  It forms the eastern edge of the Mount Dana massif.  Off the east side of the plateau, sheer rock walls drop thousands of feet down to the Owens Valley.  Some of the best rock climbing in the Sierra can be found on these walls, which are clearly visible from US 395 and highway 120.  In addition, on the lower flanks of the mountain, down in Lee Vining Canyon, some of the finest ice climbing in California is found.&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;table class=\"inline_image_thumbs\"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=58910\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/58910.JPG\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=7149\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/7149.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=57170\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/57170.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=52057\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/52057.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=4195\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/4195.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_2\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Overview of Principal Climbing &amp;amp; Skiing Routes&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Summit Hiking/Climbing Routes&lt;/b&gt;:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;- &lt;a href=\"http://www.summitpost.com/mountains/route_link.pl/route_id/676/object_id/108\"&gt;NW Slope/West Slope (\"Standard  Route\")&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt;: Class 1-2 from Tioga Pass entrance station. Secor says, \"The northwest, west, and south slopes are class 1.\"  Personally, I tend to think of Class 1 as being on-trail (e.g., Mt. Whitney Trail), so I would view this route as class 2, since the use trail is fleeting and sometimes difficult to follow, and the route involves a fair amount of (easy) talus hopping.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;- &lt;a href=\"http://www.summitpost.com/mountains/route_link.pl/route_id/183/object_id/108\"&gt;Glacier Canyon&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt;: Class  2. &lt;br&gt;This is a variation on the NW Slope route.  It starts in Glacier Canyon, then ascends the mountain\'s NW ridge about a third of the way up the mountain, and ultimately follows the NW Slope route to the summit.  According to  &lt;a href=\"http://www.summitpost.com/mountains/user_link.pl?user_id=254\"&gt;John&lt;/a&gt;, \"this route provides a much more scenic and nicer start than the standard West Slope route from the YNP Tioga Pass Entrance Station.\"&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;- Solstice Couloir&lt;/i&gt;: Class 3-4, 35-45&deg; snow/ice.  This route starts in Glacier Canyon and ascends the prominent couloir to climber\'s right of the northeast face of the peak, ultimately gaining the NW ridge.  This route may harbor a nasty cornice at the top in early season (as seen in &lt;a href=\"http://www.summitpost.com/mountains/photo_link.pl?photo_id=7528&amp;amp;object_id=108&amp;amp;type=mountain&amp;amp;mountain_id=108&amp;amp;route_id=\"&gt; this photo&lt;/a&gt;), making it significantly more difficult to attain the NW Ridge.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;- &lt;a href=\"http://www.summitpost.com/mountains/route_link.pl/route_id/106/object_id/108\"&gt;Dana Couloir&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt;: Class 3-4 , 35-45&deg; snow/ice.  Similar in steepness to the Solstice Couloir, this route also starts in Glacier Canyon, but ascends the prominent couloir to climber\'s left of the northeast face.  The exit to the summit ridge from the couloir is generally less gnar than the exit from Solstice.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Dana Plateau Climbing Routes&lt;/b&gt;:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;- &lt;a href=\"http://www.summitpost.com/mountains/route_link.pl/route_id/1149/object_id/108\"&gt;Third Pillar&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt;: A sierra classic -- seven pitches over &lt;a href=\"http://rockclimbing.org/gallery/dana.htm\"&gt;perfect rock&lt;/a&gt;.  This route ascends the prominent pinnacle that falls off the eastern escarpment of the Dana Plateau.  The Third Pillar has been said to include \"&lt;a href=\"http://rockclimbing.org/gallery/thirdpillar.htm\"&gt;the best 5.9 pitch in the universe&lt;/a&gt;.\"&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://www.summitpost.com/images/original/7724.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img border=\"1\" src=\"http://www.summitpost.com/images/thumb/7724.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Ski Routes&lt;/b&gt;:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;- &lt;a href=\"http://www.summitpost.com/mountains/route_link.pl/route_id/106/object_id/108\"&gt;Dana Couloir&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt;:  A springtime rite of passage for most California backcountry skiers.   A sustained steep (but not too steep) pitch and generally favorable snow conditions combine to make the Dana Couloir one of the most sought after ski descents in the state.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;- Ellery Bowl&lt;/i&gt;:  Another springtime favorite, Ellery Bowl has some of the steepest \"right to your car\" extreme skiing in the Sierra.  With a short car shuttle, you can combine the Dana Couloir and the Ellery Bowl for a perfect day of steep BC skiing.  Ellery Bowl also has some good intermediate skiing lower down in the bowl.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Click on the photo below for an illustrated overview of these routes.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://www.summitpost.com/mountains/photo_link.pl?photo_id=13616&amp;amp;object_id=108&amp;amp;type=mountain&amp;amp;mountain_id=108&amp;amp;route_id=\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"http://www.summitpost.com/images/thumb/7691.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Lee Vining Canyon Ice Routes&lt;/b&gt;:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;While they don\'t lead to the summit, there are some fine ice climbs on the lower reaches of the Mt. Dana massif, down in Lee Vining Canyon.  &lt;a href=\"http://www.summitpost.com/mountains/user_link.pl?user_id=254\"&gt;John&lt;/a&gt; has put up a &lt;a href=\"http://www.summitpost.com/mountains/route_link.pl/route_id/1313/object_id/108\"&gt;nice description&lt;/a&gt; of these routes.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;table class=\"inline_image_thumbs\"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=15694\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/15694.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=52184\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/52184.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=99895\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/99895.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=58924\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/58924.JPG\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=59054\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/59054.JPG\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_3\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Getting There&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;br&gt;NOTE:  These rules apply only when the Tioga Pass road (CA 120) is open through the park -- generally from Memorial Day through late October/early November each year.  For access when this road is closed, see the \"Winter &amp;amp; Early Spring Access\" section below.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;General:&lt;/i&gt;  The \"standard route\" trailhead is right at the Yosemite entrance station at Tioga Pass.  Trailheads for most other routes up Mount Dana are slightly to the east, just outside Yosemite National Park on highway 120, in the Inyo National Forest.  Visit the &lt;a href=\"http://www.summitpost.com/mountains/route_link.pl/route_id/183/object_id/108\"&gt;Glacier Canyon Route page&lt;/a&gt; for approach information regarding that route and also the &lt;a href=\"http://www.summitpost.com/mountains/route_link.pl/route_id/106/object_id/108\"&gt;Dana Couloir Route.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;From the West&lt;/i&gt;:  Take CA 120 east through Yosemite National Park to the top of Tioga Pass.  From the SF Bay Area, the most direct route is I-580 E to I-205 E (Stockton/Tracy) to I-5 N (Lathrop) to CA 120 E (Manteca).    There are a few shortcuts along the way, and I won\'t reveal all of my secrets, but the one that most everyone knows about is the \"&lt;a href=\"http://www.pashnit.com/roads/cal/OldPriestGrade.htm\"&gt;Old Priest Grade&lt;/a&gt;\" road that makes the first big climb into the foothills from the Moccasin Hetch Hetchy pump plant, up the hill to Big Oak Flat.  Look for the turnoff on the right side, just past Moccasin.  DRIVE SLOWLY ON THIS ROAD, especially on the way home.  Keep it in low gear and stay off the brakes.  Once inside the park, drive for 20 minutes or so until you reach an intersection where you will turn left to go to Tioga Pass.  Follow this road for about 45 minutes to an hour until you reach Tioga Pass.  Watch out for cops on the TPR -- &lt;i&gt;especially&lt;/i&gt; near Olmstead Point and &lt;a href=\"http://www.summitpost.com/mountains/display_component.pl?type=component&amp;amp;mountain_id=759&amp;amp;route_id=&amp;amp;component_id=7753&amp;amp;object_id=7753\"&gt;Tuolumne Meadows&lt;/a&gt;, where the legal limit plummets to 25mph.  Click &lt;a href=\"http://www.4yosemite.com/parkinfo.htm\"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; for info on roads and speed traps in Yosemite.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As an alternate route, some visitors approaching from the west may prefer to use highway 108 over Sonora Pass, instead of highway 120 through Yosemite. For one, you can avoid paying the national park entrance fee ($20), if you never plan to enter the park anyway. Second, you can score breakfast in Bridgeport or Lee Vining.  Third, if you plan on doing an overnight trip into the wilderness, starting from a national forest trailhead, you\'ll have to get your permit in Lee Vining anyway.  Here are &lt;a href=\"http://maps.yahoo.com/py/ddResults.py?Pyt=Tmap&amp;amp;tarname=&amp;amp;tardesc=&amp;amp;osd=n&amp;amp;newname=&amp;amp;newdesc=&amp;amp;dsd=g&amp;amp;newHash=1969431214&amp;amp;newTHash=753813265&amp;amp;newErr=3001&amp;amp;newTErr=1000&amp;amp;newFL=Use+Address+Below&amp;amp;newaddr=SFO&amp;amp;newcsz=San+Francisco%2C+CA&amp;amp;newcountry=us&amp;amp;newTFL=Use+Address+Below&amp;amp;newtaddr=&amp;amp;newtcsz=Lee+Vining%2C+CA&amp;amp;newtcountry=us&amp;amp;Submit=Get+Directions\"&gt;Yahoo! Driving Directions&lt;/a&gt; from SFO to Lee Vining.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;From the East&lt;/i&gt;:  Basically, make your way to US 395, a beautiful and often desolate road that hugs the eastern escarpment of the Sierra.  Once on US 395, head to Lee Vining, which is about 2 1/2 to 3 hours south of Reno, and about 35 minutes north of Mammoth Lakes.  At Lee Vining, turn onto CA 120 W and drive about 13 miles to the top of Tioga Pass.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;table class=\"inline_image_thumbs\"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=14779\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/14779.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=7327\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/7327.JPG\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=7328\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/7328.JPG\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=58908\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/58908.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=85994\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/85994.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_4\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Winter &amp;amp; Early Spring Access&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;br&gt;The seasonal closure of the Tioga Pass road (CA 120) renders the standard approach from the national park impassible for cars from (roughly) mid-November to late May.  The NPS closes the road at Crane Flat, 40-odd miles from Mount Dana.  However, there is some good news:  CalTrans closes the east side of the Tioga Pass road &lt;a href=\"http://www.tahoebackcountry.net/host/images/tiogagate.jpg\"&gt;3 miles west of US 395&lt;/a&gt;, making a winter approach from the east (approximately ten miles) much more feasible.  Access to the ice routes in Lee Vining Canyon can be had by driving up to the Edison Power Plant (directions on the &lt;a href=\"http://www.summitpost.com/mountains/route_link.pl/route_id/1313/object_id/108\"&gt;route page&lt;/a&gt;).  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In mid-Spring (usually coincident with the commencment of fishing season in late April), the road is plowed up to the eastern park entrance of Yosemite at the pass itself (although the NPS generally does not open the gate until a month or so later).  As the opening dates approach, rumors usually abound about plowing activity on the road.  Follow the message boards here and on the talk forum at &lt;a href=\"http://www.telemarktips.com\"&gt;Telemarktips.com&lt;/a&gt; and you will generally get good beta on road openings.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In winter, visitors from the north, east and south can take the all-season US 395 to Lee Vining and then drive/ski up the Tioga Pass road from there.  However, visitors from the west (generally, the Bay Area) have to somehow get over the Sierra crest and drive down US 395 to reach Lee Vining.  The options are slim, since there are only three roads that cross the Sierra in Northern California during the winter:  CA 88 (Carson Pass), US 50 (Echo Summit) and I-80 (Donner Summit).  The shortest route is to take CA 88 to Woodford, and then into Nevada, where you will hit US 395 near Minden/Gardnerville.  (You can also take US 50 over Echo Summit, then south on US 89 to Woodfords).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Once in Lee Vining, some combination of driving, skiing, snowshoeing, hiking and/or bicycling will get you up to Tioga Pass.  Note that although the road will be &lt;a href=\"http://www.tahoebackcountry.net/host/images/tiogagate.jpg\"&gt;gated&lt;/a&gt; about 3 miles west of Lee Vining (you can park here), the road will likely not be completely snow-covered beyond the gate, especially later in the spring.  Thus, you will find yourself part-hiking and part-skiing up the long Lee Vining Canyon.  Some folks have taken bikes up the road to reach snowline with some success.  Take care if you head up the road, particularly if you do so later in the day, for there is significant rockfall danger on the road, as shown in &lt;a href=\"http://www.tahoebackcountry.net/host/images/tioga_dry.jpg\"&gt;these pictures&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As noted above, &lt;a href=\"http://www.tiogapassresort.com/\"&gt;Tioga Pass Resort&lt;/a&gt;, located at 9600 feet elevation, just east of Tioga Pass, may haul your gear up on snowmobile if you are staying in their cabins.  Check their website for details.&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;table class=\"inline_image_thumbs\"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=15684\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/15684.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=15691\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/15691.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=15692\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/15692.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_5\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Red Tape&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;br&gt;No permits are required for day trips to Mount Dana.  Because the summit is less than three miles from the highway, overnight trips to Mount Dana are fairly rare.  Trips into the surrounding backcountry are another story, however.  The red tape for visits to the backcountry around Mount Dana can get a bit complicated.  Straddling the Sierra Crest, half of the peak lies within Yosemite National Park, the other half within &lt;a href=\"http://www.r5.fs.fed.us/inyo/index.htm\"&gt;Inyo National Forest&lt;/a&gt;.  For example, Dogs are prohibited on all trails in Yosemite (except the Yosemite valley floor), but are not prohibited everywhere in the Inyo NF (&lt;a href=\"http://www.r5.fs.fed.us/inyo/vvc/wild_permits/special.htm#pets\"&gt;click here&lt;/a&gt; for more detail).  Around Mount Dana\'s fragile environment, its probably best to leave Fido at home.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For trips originating in the national park, the &lt;a href=\"http://www.summitpost.com/mountains/display_component.pl?type=component&amp;amp;mountain_id=759&amp;amp;route_id=&amp;amp;component_id=7754&amp;amp;object_id=7754\"&gt;Tuolumne Meadows page&lt;/a&gt; summarizes all the pertinent red tape.  One special note is that camping is prohibited in the Parker Pass Creek drainage inside the park.  If you want to camp in this area, you have to cross Parker Pass and exit the park.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For trips originating in the national forest, the &lt;a href=\"http://www.r5.fs.fed.us/inyo/vvc/mono/index.htm\"&gt;Mono Basin Ranger District&lt;/a&gt; of Inyo NF maintains an excellent and thorough page, with many means of contact.&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;table class=\"inline_image_thumbs\"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=59062\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/59062.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=59060\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/59060.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_6\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Camping&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;br&gt;Detailed car camping, backcountry camping, and traditional lodging information for Yosemite NP can be found on &lt;a href=\"http://www.summitpost.com/mountains/display_component.pl?type=component&amp;amp;mountain_id=759&amp;amp;route_id=&amp;amp;component_id=7755&amp;amp;object_id=7755\"&gt;this Tuolumne Meadows camping page&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Additionally, car camping choices abound in Inyo NF.  &lt;a href=\"http://www.fs.fed.us/r5/inyo/recreation/campgrounds.html\"&gt;This excellent forest service page&lt;/a&gt; provides detailed information on camping in the eastside area.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Homepage for backcountry camping in Inyo NF can be found &lt;a href=\"http://www.fs.fed.us/r5/inyo/recreation/wild/index.html\"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.  After you follow the instructions to make a reservation, you will probably find it most convenient to pick up your wildnerness permit at the &lt;a href=\"http://www.fs.fed.us/r5/inyo/vc/mono/index.html\"&gt;Mono Basin Ranger Station&lt;/a&gt;, located 1/2 mile north of Lee Vining on US 395.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Too poor for even a $7 national forest campground?  &lt;a href=\"http://www.summitpost.com/mountains/user_link.pl?user_id=254\"&gt;John&lt;/a&gt; notes, \"you can sleep at the Tioga Lake Overlook (just outside of YNP on CA SR-120) for free :-) Most people sleep in their cars here but it may also be possible to sleep down by the lake without being bothered. Neither rangers nor bears will disturb you as late as the summer of 2001. Also if you hike up Mount Dana from Tioga Lake via the &lt;a href=\"http://www.summitpost.com/mountains/route_link.pl/route_id/183/object_id/108\"&gt;Glacier Canyon Route&lt;/a&gt; you don\'t enter the park until 11,200 feet (read - no fee!).\"&lt;br&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_7\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Mountain Conditions&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://www.summitpost.com/mountains/display_component.pl?type=component&amp;amp;mountain_id=759&amp;amp;route_id=&amp;amp;component_id=8563&amp;amp;object_id=8563\"&gt;Tuolumne Meadows current weather information&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://cdec.water.ca.gov/cgi-progs/queryF?TMM\"&gt;Toulmne Meadows NPS&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://cdec.water.ca.gov/cgi-progs/queryF?TuM\"&gt;Toulmne Meadows CDWR&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;table class=\"inline_image_thumbs\"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=79322\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/79322.JPG\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_8\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Geology&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;br&gt;With its massive bulk composed of loose, bright red rocks, the first time viewer of Mount Dana from the west notices that it is incongruous with the \"trademark\" light granite peaks of Yosemite.  The rocks which now make up Mount Dana were emplaced many millions of years ago, as sediments along the continent, buried, and later uplifted.  Tectonic stresses, and proximity to the hot Sierra Nevada batholith (the source of the Sierran granites) considerably metamorphosed the original sediments into brittle, slate-like minerals.&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;table class=\"inline_image_thumbs\"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=59056\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/59056.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_9\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;External Links&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://www.rockclimbing.org/gallery/dana.htm\"&gt;Alpine Rock par Excellence-Third Pillar Headwall&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt; The headwall of Third Pillar showing the knifeblade cracks of \"One That Almost Got Away\" in the center&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://www.rockclimbing.org/gallery/thirdpillar_knife.htm\"&gt;Third Pillar of Dana&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt; Miguel at the start of the knifeblade crack.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://hiking.adampaul.com/dana03.shtml\"&gt;A wonderful dayhike&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://www.fedak.net/albums/MountDana.html\"&gt;Fedak\'s Dana Dayhike&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://www.snwburd.com/bob/trip_reports/dana_1.html\"&gt;Dana/Gibbs dayhike - Aug 6, 1993&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;div align=\"center\"&gt;&lt;a name=\"messages\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_10\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Additions and Corrections&lt;/h2&gt;[ &lt;a href=\"/object_discussion.php?type=vote_comments&amp;amp;object_id=150284&amp;amp;is_addition=1#vote_form\"&gt;Post an Addition or Correction&lt;/a&gt; ]&lt;table cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" style=\"width: 775px;\"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;table cellpadding=\"2\" cellspacing=\"2\" width=\"100%\"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;&lt;span class=\"pagertext\"&gt;Viewing: &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;-&lt;b&gt;3&lt;/b&gt; of &lt;b&gt;3&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td align=\"center\"&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td align=\"right\"&gt;    &lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;table border=\"0\" width=\"775\" class=\"messages\"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td width=\"110\" align=\"left\" valign=\"top\" style=\"padding-top: 6px;\"&gt;&lt;a name=\"163703\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a class=\"dis_user_lnk\" href=\"/users/tarol/26978\"&gt;tarol&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td valign=\"top\" style=\"padding-top: 6px;\"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Inyo NF links have changed&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td align=\"right\" valign=\"top\" nowrap style=\"font-size: 10px;\"&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td valign=\"top\" rowspan=\"2\" align=\"left\" style=\"padding-top: 6px;\"&gt;&lt;p class=\"disc_avatar\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"/users/tarol/26978\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"tarol\" width=\"50\" height=\"50\" border=\"0\" src=\"/images/avatars/844898.JPG\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=\"font-size: 9px; color: #888;\"&gt;Voted 10/10&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td colspan=\"2\" style=\"padding-top: 6px;\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://www.fs.fed.us/r5/inyo\"&gt;http://www.fs.fed.us/r5/inyo&lt;/a&gt; is the correct web address :)&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td valign=\"bottom\" style=\"padding-top: 6px;\" colspan=\"2\"&gt;&lt;span style=\"font-size: 9px; color: #888;\"&gt;Posted Dec 11, 2006 11:06 pm&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;table border=\"0\" width=\"775\" class=\"messages\"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td width=\"110\" align=\"left\" valign=\"top\" style=\"padding-top: 6px;\"&gt;&lt;a name=\"473832\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a class=\"dis_user_lnk\" href=\"/users/diesel/108193\"&gt;Diesel&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td valign=\"top\" style=\"padding-top: 6px;\"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mt Dana - short hike&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td align=\"right\" valign=\"top\" nowrap style=\"font-size: 10px;\"&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td valign=\"top\" rowspan=\"2\" align=\"left\" style=\"padding-top: 6px;\"&gt;&lt;p class=\"disc_avatar\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"/users/diesel/108193\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Diesel\" width=\"50\" height=\"50\" border=\"0\" src=\"/images/avatars/901512.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=\"font-size: 9px; color: #888;\"&gt;Hasn\'t voted&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td colspan=\"2\" style=\"padding-top: 6px;\"&gt;I hiked this on 7/29/2013&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The trailhead is located just before the entrance into the Yosemite Park, to the left as one looks at the ticketing boots. There is a parking lot right before the entrance, so there is no fee if the intent is just to hike around that area.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Mt. Dana could be easily seen from this gravel parking lot. The hike itself is only 2.5 miles one way. Keep in mind though that one gains 3,000 ft altitude in these 2.5 miles. Meaning: the hike is steep. The trail is very well defined. The fist part goes through the Mt. Dana meadows and then starts brutally uphill. Once above the tree line, one is a mile into the hike. From here don&rsquo;t let yourself deceived: the summit one sees is just a ridge and not Mt Dana. Once one reaches this ridge, the real summit appears. Your jaw will drop. From the ridge to the bottom of the final climb is a nice walk, but it will feel very short compare to what is coming. It took me 2:10 minutes to hike. One hiker told me it took him 2 hour to get to the top. The top was very windy and mostly cloudy: I was barely able to see Mono Lake from there. The views toward Yosemite Park are very spectacular. Most of the hikers took between 3 and 4 hours to the top. It all depends on the experience and training.  Although this might look like a shot hike, Mt Dana stays at over 13,000 ft. Yes, the altitude will get to you. Be prepared. Good luck. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td valign=\"bottom\" style=\"padding-top: 6px;\" colspan=\"2\"&gt;&lt;span style=\"font-size: 9px; color: #888;\"&gt;Posted Aug 7, 2013 5:45 pm&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;table border=\"0\" width=\"775\" class=\"messages\"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td width=\"110\" align=\"left\" valign=\"top\" style=\"padding-top: 6px;\"&gt;&lt;a name=\"483782\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a class=\"dis_user_lnk\" href=\"/users/maddog1421/118643\"&gt;Maddog1421&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td valign=\"top\" style=\"padding-top: 6px;\"&gt;&lt;b&gt;What a hike!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td align=\"right\" valign=\"top\" nowrap style=\"font-size: 10px;\"&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td valign=\"top\" rowspan=\"2\" align=\"left\" style=\"padding-top: 6px;\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=\"font-size: 9px; color: #888;\"&gt;Hasn\'t voted&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td colspan=\"2\" style=\"padding-top: 6px;\"&gt;Had the privilege of hiking Mount Dana this past weekend.  I had scouted it out a few weeks ago but the hike proved difficult due to the snow above 11000 ft. The trail was very hard to follow. This time we manage to stay on the trail for the most part.  The first mile and a half is very enjoyable as you hike the valley floor and wind past the lakes and ponds. The ascent starts gradually giving a false sense of security.    At about a mile and a half the terrain turns very rocky and the ascent becomes very difficult.  I suggest a slow methodical ascent and you will be rewarded with some spectacular views at the summit!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;You have to be a very good hiker to do the round trip in 4 hours. I think six is more reasonable. It took me 8 hours. &lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td valign=\"bottom\" style=\"padding-top: 6px;\" colspan=\"2\"&gt;&lt;span style=\"font-size: 9px; color: #888;\"&gt;Posted Jun 16, 2014 11:57 pm&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;table border=\"0\" width=\"775\"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;table cellpadding=\"2\" cellspacing=\"2\" width=\"100%\"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;&lt;span class=\"pagertext\"&gt;Viewing: &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;-&lt;b&gt;3&lt;/b&gt; of &lt;b&gt;3&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td align=\"center\"&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td align=\"right\"&gt;    &lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_11\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Images&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div align=\"center\"&gt;&lt;table id=\"my_images\"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/mt-dana-at-moonlight/214110/c-150284\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Mt.

Captain George Vancouver renamed it after  Admiral Peter Rainier of the British Navy during a scouting expedition on May 7,  1792. This name was hotly contested for over 100 years, because Americans felt  it shouldn\'t be named after a British officer who had never even been to the  U.S.    &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The first ascent is believed to be in 1852, but is undocumented. The first  recorded ascent was on August 17, 1870 by General Hazard Stevens and Philemon  Van Trump, via the Gibralter Ledges route. James Longmire introduced the climbing party to the Yakima Indian Sluiskin who provided the party with assistance in getting to the base of the mountain. They  climbed in 1 day from their camp just below the Gibralter Ledges. Upon reaching the summit,  they nearly collapsed due to exhaustion, but managed to find a steam vent to  hide in. &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;div align=\"center\" class=\"image-left\" style=\"width: 206px;\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"/mount-rainier-on-march-23/18965\"&gt;&lt;img width=\"200\" height=\"150\" alt=\"Mount Rainier on March 23,...\" src=\"/images/small/18965.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=\"caption\"&gt;South Side&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;On March 2, 1899 president William McKinley authorized the creation of Mount  Rainier National Park protecting 235,625 acres, including over 35 square miles  of glaciers blanketing the mountain. There are 25 large named glaciers on Mount  Rainier, including the enormous Emmons, which flows down the east face. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It is the highest volcano of the Cascade Range and the fifth highest mountain  of the continental USA. This is a huge mountain with multiple glaciers and  routes of all technical levels.  Mount Rainier, the most heavily  glaciated peak in the contiguous United States, offers an exciting challenge to  the mountaineer.  The regularly climbed routes are the  Disappointment Cleaver and the Emmons Glacier which are consider class 4 routes.  More than 10,000 people a year try to scale this mountain and many expeditions  for bigger mountains come to Rainier for their training runs. &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;div align=\"center\" class=\"image-left\" style=\"width: 206px;\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"/looking-up-nisqually-glacier/54359\"&gt;&lt;img width=\"200\" height=\"150\" alt=\"Looking up Nisqually Glacier...\" src=\"/images/small/54359.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=\"caption\"&gt;Nisqually Glacier&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The summit of this mountain is unique to mountains.  There are actually 3 separately   classified summits of this peak, Columbia Crest which is the highest point at   14,411 feet, Point Success at 14,158 feet to the southwest, and Liberty Cap at   14,112 feet to the northwest all separated by a large crater.  The most   standard routes actually bring you to the crater rim at 14,150 feet.  A lot   of climbers consider this as the summit, or close enough, but to attain the true   summit, it is an hour walk round trip a quarter mile across the crater to   Columbia Crest.  Here you can find a summit log.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p align=\"center\"&gt;&lt;b&gt; ----  A Word on the Height of the Mountain ----&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;There has been some questions regarding the true height of the mountain   recently.  In books it is reported as 14,410 and 14,411.  There are a   couple sources (unofficial) that report as high as 14,414.  However,    the National Park Service and all other official sources recognize the height as   14,411.05 feet. This is based on a recent survey of the mountain. This is 12.6   inches taller than figured in 1956 (hence the 1 foot discrepancy in many books).    Using data from a constellation of satellites and the number-crunching power of   modern computers, Bothell surveyor Larry Signani calculated the mountain\'s   height at 14,411.05 feet&mdash;just 12.6 inches taller than the official height   computed in 1956 by the U.S. Geological Survey, using traditional triangulation   methods.   &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The new measurement is even closer to the 14,411.1 feet logged in 1988 by   many of the same people involved in this latest effort.  The new   measurement was made using Global Positioning System, or GPS, data, which   surveyors can now use to pinpoint elevations with unprecedented accuracy.     In late August, a team of six surveyors climbed the summit carrying two   lightweight GPS receivers, which detect electronic signals from 24 GPS   satellites orbiting the earth.   Measurements are calculated by timing   how long it takes the satellite signals to reach the receiver and by doing a lot   of mathematical gyrations. &lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div align=\"center\" class=\"image-left\" style=\"width: 506px;\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"/mt-rainier-from-above/51966\"&gt;&lt;img width=\"500\" height=\"375\" alt=\"Mt.

There is an  entrance fee of $15.00 for a vehicle.  The pass is good for 7 days.  A  Mount Rainier pass is available for purchase and is good for one year.  The  price of the pass is $20.00.  Do the math ... if you are going to make more  than 2 trips into the park in a given year, consider buying the year long  pass.     &lt;div align=\"center\" class=\"image-left\" style=\"width: 206px;\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"/david-where-we-dead-ended-on/91556\"&gt;&lt;img width=\"200\" height=\"150\" alt=\"David where we dead-ended on...\" src=\"/images/small/91556.JPG\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=\"caption\"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p align=\"center\"&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;Following are directions to the climbing access areas:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;u&gt;Paradise, Longmire and Westside Climbing Access:&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;These climbing routes are accessed through the Nisqually entrance at the  southwest corner of Rainier National Park.  This is the only entrance that  is open year around.  Access from Yakima is through the Stevens Canyon  entrance and is closed in the winter.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;From Seattle (Airport):  Take I-5 south to I-405.  Go 3-4 miles on  I-405 and take State Route 167 south.  Drive about 21 miles to State Route  512.  In 3 miles, exit on the right onto State Route 161 south.  Stay  on 161 through Puyallup and Graham into Eatonville.  Turn left at the stop  sign in Eatonville.  There is a sign to Mount Rainier there.  Follow  the narrow 2 lane road to the end.  Turn left on SR 7 and continue to the  town of Elbe.  Stay left on SR 706 in Elbe and drive approximately 13 miles  east through Ashford to the entrance of the park.  (Note:  Ashford in  the base for RMI and the Summit House if you are renting equipment or using RMI  for a guide service). Once you enter the park, it is about a 30 minute scenic  drive to Paradise.        From the East: Take I90 west and get off at exit 110 on I82 east. Head south for  approximately 30 miles, then turn west unto route 12 just before Yakima. To get  to Paradise, continue on route 12 for approx. 60 miles then make a right unto  route 123 and follow the signs. For the Emmons glacier route, go 20 miles on  route 20, then turn right unto route 410. Once inside the park, make a right on  route 123 then a left on Sunrise Park Road. Note that all access to Mount  Rainier from the east is closed in the winter and early spring. For a winter  climb, first drive to Seattle then follow the directions from there.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;div align=\"center\" class=\"image-left\" style=\"width: 156px;\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"/our-team-on-the-descent-at/62320\"&gt;&lt;img width=\"150\" height=\"200\" alt=\"Our team on the descent at...\" src=\"/images/small/62320.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=\"caption\"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;u&gt;Mowich Lake and Carbon River Climbing Access:&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;From Seattle (Airport):  Take I-5 south to I-405.

Primary registration locations are the Paradise Ranger Station, White River Wilderness Information Center, and the Wilkeson Wilderness Information Center.  The climbing fee is $45 per person per calendar year. The fee is payable when registering. Climbing fees help recover costs for protecting the mountain\'s delicate and unique alpine environment, staffing the mountain\'s high camps and ranger stations with climbing rangers, managing upper mountain human waste and providing rangers who can rapidly respond to incidents on the mountain.

In recent years, Mount Rainier has become quite popular to climb in the winter and early spring. Since the road to Paradise from Longmire is the only plowed access to Rainier this time of year, most ascents are made on the south side of the mountain. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The two standard routes both use the hut at Camp Muir as a high camp. The first route is Gibralter Ledges, usually referred to as the \"Gib Ledges\", which ascends the ledge system between the Nisquilly and Ingram Glaciers. The other route is the Ingram Glacier Direct   or as a variation late in the season Disappointment Cleaver route, which is used by Rainier Mountaineering from December to the end of May for their clients. If you take the Ingram route during heavy snow conditions, do not cut through Cadever Gap. Several parties have died from avalanches here.   See the table below for the full descriptions of routes and their approaches.&lt;br&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_5\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Camping&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;div align=\"center\" class=\"image-left\" style=\"width: 206px;\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"/camp-schurman-in-june-04/104150\"&gt;&lt;img width=\"200\" height=\"150\" alt=\"Camp Schurman, in June 04\" src=\"/images/small/104150.JPG\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=\"caption\"&gt;Camp Shurman from above&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Parties may camp for a maximum of 14 days in the backcountry.  Maximum  party size is 12 people, with any team larger than 5 considered a  group.   High camps on the standard routes are located at Camp Muir on the south side  and Camp Schurman on the east side.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Camp Muir:&lt;/b&gt; Located at 10,080 ft., facilities include a Ranger Station,  solar toilet, and the Muir Public Shelter which will accommodate approximately  25 people on a first-come, first-served basis.

The climb up Handies is quite nice scenery and the summit is noted for its remotness from civilization. &lt;b&gt;From the summit you cant see a city or a road.. not a sign of civilization&lt;/b&gt;. The two most popular trailheads to climb Handies are the American Basin trailhead, and the Grizzly Gulch trailhead. Grizzly Gulch is a longer climb, but  it has the advantage that  you can use the same trailhead to also climb Redcloud and Sunshine. It is also the most scenic route up Handies and is marked as a classic route. Redcloud and Sunshine are usually done together in one day and Handies the next. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;American Basin has the advantage of being the shortest route to the summit. Sometimes people will climb Redcloud and Sunshine one day then drive to American Basin to climb Handies. Those that I know that have done this said the road was rough between the trailheads and recommend 4wd. Personally, I like the idea of setting camp at Grizzly Gulch and doing all 3 peaks from there in 2 days and not having to move- plus it is more scenic this way.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For more information on the area see: &lt;a href=\"http://www.fs.fed.us/r2/gmug/\"&gt;Uncomahgre National Forest&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;table class=\"inline_image_thumbs\"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=1283\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/1283.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=1284\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/1284.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=8298\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/8298.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=20952\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/20952.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=61723\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/61723.JPG\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_2\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Getting There&lt;/h2&gt;In Lake City begin measuring from the bridge crossing Henson Creek, heading south. Go 2.2 miles to the Lake San Cristobal Road and turn right. Go past the beautiful lake and up the Lake Fork of the Gunnison River. Continue to mile 14.3 where the road forks and a take the right fork up Cinnamon Pass Road. At mile 18.3 you will see the large parking lot at the Silver Creek - Grizzly Gulch Trailhead. An alternate way to reach the trailheads is from Silverton. Measuring from Silverton\'s north end, follow Hwy110 for 12.3 miles to Animas Forks, climb steeply east to reach Cinnamon Pass at 15.3 miles, cross the pass and descend on its east side to reach the Silver Creek- Grizzly Gulch Trailhead after 21.1 miles. A 4 WD is required for this approach. &lt;br&gt;There is ample parking available at the Grizzly Gulch trailhead. The trailhead also has toilet facilities.&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;table class=\"inline_image_thumbs\"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=60929\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/60929.JPG\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=8395\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/8395.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=12206\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/12206.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=22959\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/22959.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=21579\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/21579.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_3\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Mountain Conditions&lt;/h2&gt;The trail from Grizzly Gulch starts out crossing the Lake Fork of the Gunnison River  over a  couple of logs. From there it follows the creek for about 2 miles. Handies is easily visible. We took the approach up the East slopes ( the classic approach). It takes you up to a saddle then across the ridge to the summit. You do see some cars and roads below just short of the summit, but by the time you reach the summit they are blocked from view.  Colorado mountains are famous for afternoon summer storms. Watch the skies and try to be off the summit by noon to be on the safe side.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Conditions on this mountain, like all Colorado 14ers, are subject to change rapidly- especially during the summer when most people climb Handies. The mountains are their own weather system, and weather forecasts from nearby towns often have little to do with actual mountain conditions. You can generally count on clear to partly cloudy in the morning, and heavy clouds and thunderstorms in the afternoon during the summer. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There is no substitute for getting an early start, and getting as much of the mountain \"behind you\" as early in the day as possible. Keep a good eye on the sky as weather conditions can deteriorate rapidly. The greatest weather danger is from lightning strikes, and climbers are killed almost every summer in Colorado by lightning strikes. July seems to be the most deadly month for lightning.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Two  climbers were  killed by lightning in Colorado within a couple days of each other in the summer of 2003.  I think the following important information from Gerry Roach\'s book  \"Colorado\'s Fourteeners From Hikes to Climbs\" bears repeating. Added here with permission from Gerry Roach:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Colorado is famous for apocalyptic lightning storms that threaten not just your life, but your soul as well. This section will have special meaning if you have ever been trapped by a storm that endures for more than an hour and leaves no gap between one peal of thunder and the next. The term simultaneous flash-boom has a very personal meaning for many Colorado Climbers&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Dangers&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;1. Lightning is dangerous!&lt;br&gt;2. Lightning is the greatest external hazard to summer mountaineering in Colorado.&lt;br&gt;3. Lightning kills people every year in Colorado\'s mountains.&lt;br&gt;4. Direct hits are usually fatal.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Precautions&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;1. Start early! Be off summits by noon and back in the valley by early afternoon.&lt;br&gt;2. Observe thunderhead buildup carefully, noting speed and direction; towering thunderheads with black bottoms are bad.&lt;br&gt;3. When lightning begins nearby, count the seconds between flash and thunder, then divide by 5 to calculate the distance to the flash in miles. Repeat to determine if lightning is approaching. &lt;br&gt;4. Try to determine if the lightning activity is cloud-to-cloud or ground strikes.&lt;br&gt;5. Get off summits and ridges. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Protection&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;1. You cannot outrun a storm; physics wins.&lt;br&gt;2. When caught, seek a safe zone in the 45-degree cone around an object 5 to 10 times your height.&lt;br&gt;3. Be aware of ground currents; the current from a ground strike disperses along the ground or cliff, especially in wet cracks.&lt;br&gt;4. Wet ropes are good conductors.&lt;br&gt;5. Snow is not a good conductor.&lt;br&gt;6. Separate yourself from metal objects.&lt;br&gt;7. Avoid sheltering in spark gaps under boulders and trees.&lt;br&gt;8. Disperse the group. Survivors can revive one who is hit.&lt;br&gt;9. Crouch on boot soles, ideally on dry, insulating material such as moss or grass. Dirt is better than rock. Avoid water. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The following link is also helpful: &lt;a href=\"http://home.fuse.net/engineering/LightningSafety.htm#Safe%20Practice%20Crouch\"&gt;Lightning Safety and Crouch&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Also see this report by &lt;a href=\"http://summitpost.com/cgi-bin/user_link.pl?user_id=570\"&gt;nchenkin&lt;/a&gt; It will make you really think about lightning safety: &lt;a href=\"http://summitpost.com/mountains/trip_report.pl?trip_report_id=618&amp;amp;mountain_id=1990\"&gt;Struck By Lightning!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_4\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Camping&lt;/h2&gt;Camping is readily available at the trailhead and there is adequate parking and toilet facilities. There is no charge for camping or parking. Lots of tourists will drive up to the trailhead for the day, but ample parking is available for them as well as the climbers.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If  you are going to climb Redcloud and Sunshine one day and Handies the next I would recommend staying at the Silver Creek Grizzly Gulch trailhead. Ericdix adds: We climbed Redcloud and Sunshine, and then the next day planned to climb Handies. We chose to move our camp from the Silver Creek/Grizzley Gulch Trailhead to American Basin. This made for a much shorter route. At this trailhead however, there are not many good campsites. So for those of you looking to combine Handies with Redcloud and Sunshine, it might be easier to camp at the Grizzley Gulch Trailhead. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;table class=\"inline_image_thumbs\"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=1173\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/1173.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=1410\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/1410.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_5\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;When To Climb&lt;/h2&gt;Summer is easiest and most popular. July and August tend to be peak season. Try to climb during the week if possible to avoid the crowds. This is a popular climb in the San Juan mountain range because you can climb 3 mountains from the same trailhead ( Redcloud Peak, Sunshine Peak, and Handies Peak). Colorado mountains are famous for afternoon storms. Try to climb early and as a rule of thumb be off the summit by noon.&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;table class=\"inline_image_thumbs\"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=4140\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/4140.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=4137\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/4137.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=12034\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/12034.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=21580\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/21580.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=22960\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/22960.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_6\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;People Pics&lt;/h2&gt;Add your People Pics and any other miscellaneous information here.&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;table class=\"inline_image_thumbs\"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=3583\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/3583.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=61208\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/61208.JPG\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=40917\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/40917.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=82008\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/82008.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_7\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;External Links&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://14ers.org\"&gt;COLORADO 14ERS INITIATIVE&lt;/a&gt;

He is responsible for most of the great information on this page. I hope to maintain the same quality that he has over the years!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Grand Teton!   Even the name inspires one to explore and climb it\'s classic routes.    Grand Teton is a classic alpine peak in itself to the point that an entire national park was named after it.    Climbers have been drawn to \"The Grand\" for over 100 years and continue to make pilgrimages from all over the world.  With over 35 routes and 50 variations to those routes, there is something for everyone from 5.4 to 5.12.    New routes are being discovered every year including The Squeeze Box, Grade IV, M7, A0, put up by Stephen Koch and Hans Johnstone on  February 6, 2007.   This new route is on the north face and lies between Shea\'s Chute and the Alex Lowe Memorial Route, and ascends a weakness up a beautiful granite buttress (&lt;a href=\"http://www.stephenkoch.com\"&gt;www.StephenKoch.com&lt;/a&gt;).     Even the easiest route, the Owen-Spalding, is a technical endeavor and should not be taken lightly.   At Grade II, 5.4, the Owen-Spalding is the standard route and requires technical rock climbing skills and equipment.   The Exum Ridge route is the most famous, named after Grand Teton pioneer, Glenn Exum.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The first ascent of The Grand was on August 11, 1898 by William Owen, Franklin Spalding, Frank Peterson, and John Shive via the now-called Owen-Spalding route.    Although the Owen party is officially credited with the first ascent, there is a controversy on whether they were actually the first to climb The Grand.    Supposedly, Nathaniel Langford and James Stevenson climbed the mountain 25 years earlier.   Read an article on the controversy &lt;a href=\"http://www.summitpost.org/article/175317/the-grand-question.html\"&gt;HERE&lt;/a&gt;.The remainder of Grand Teton history is very rich and much too detailed to be described here.    The references listed below are highly recommended for a detailed history of the mountain.    One reason the early history of climbing The Grand is so well known is because the summit logs have been maintained by the park superintendent since 1927.   This rich history continues to this day.   &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://www.tetonclimbinghistory.com/index.html\"&gt;CLICK HERE TO VIEW THE SUMMIT REGISTER ARCHIVE&lt;/a&gt;:  This site contains a collection of digital images of the Grand Teton National Park Summit Register Archive including the register for the Grand Teton.   The summit registers were maintained from about the late-1920s into the 1980s and they form a unique repository of Teton climbing history.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The three Tetons: Grand, Middle, and South were named in the 1800\'s by French Trappers of the Hudson Bay Company. They called them Les Trois Tetons, which meant &ldquo;the three breasts.&rdquo; Early native American Indians of the Shoshone tribe called the range &ldquo;Hoary Headed Fathers.&rdquo; &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;BTW:  A common mistake is for people to call the Teton Range \"The Grand Tetons.\"   The proper term is \"the Tetons\" or \"the Teton range.\"  The Grand Teton is a single mountain and deserving of distinction.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://www.summitpost.org/mountains/photo_link.pl/p/photo_id__123180__object_id____type__new__mountain_id____route_id____user_id____order_by____limit__\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"http://www.summitpost.org/images/medium/81466.jpg\" style=\"\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;Photo by Biglost&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Noteworthy Ascents/Events of Grand Teton:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Exum Ridge:  July 15, 1931; Glenn Exum&lt;br&gt;North Face:  August 25, 1936; Jack Durrance, Paul and Eldon Petzoldt  &lt;br&gt;East Ridge:  July 22, 1929; Robert Underhill&lt;br&gt;First Female Ascent:  August 27, 1923; Eleanor Davis&lt;br&gt;First Winter Ascent: December 19, 1935; Fred Brown, Paul and Eldon Petzoldt &lt;br&gt;First Ski Descent:  June 16, 1971; Bill Briggs and Robbie Garnett via the Stettner Couloir&lt;br&gt;Speed Record:  August 22, 2012; Andy Anderson; 2:53:02; Lupine Meadows to summit and back  &lt;br&gt;First Grand Traverse:  1966; Jim McCarthy, Lito Tejada-Flores &lt;br&gt;Grand Traverse Speed Record:  2000; Rolando Garibotti; 6 hours, 49 minutes  &lt;br&gt;First Winter Grand Traverse:   January 19, 2004; Stephen Koch and Mark Newcomb &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Sources:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;Mountaineering In The Tetons&lt;/i&gt;, by Fritiof Fryxell&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;A Climber\'s Guide To The Teton Range&lt;/i&gt;, by Leigh Ortenburger and Reynold G.

Photo and editing by Alan Ellis&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br&gt;Grand Teton is located in the northwest corner of Wyoming inside &lt;a href=\"http://www.nps.gov/grte/index.htm\"&gt;Grand Teton National Park&lt;/a&gt;. From the north entrance of the park, drive south 28.5 miles to Moran Junction on highway 191. From Moran Junction, continue south on highway 191 for 18 miles to Moose Junction where you turn right (west). From Jackson, Wyoming, drive north 12 miles on highway 191 to Moose Junction and turn left (west). At Moose Junction, drive about seven miles to the sign for Lupine Meadow Trailhead.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Lupine Meadow trailhead is the jumping off point for most routes on the mountain.  Expect a lot of cars at this trailhead.  From Lupine Meadow Trailhead (6732 ft) follow the trail up through Garnet Canyon. At 1.7 miles the trail forks. Stay right and continue for 1.5 miles where the trail forks again. If climbing the Owen-Spalding, Exum Ridge, or Petzoldt Ridge, go left, following the signs to Garnet Canyon.  After 1.1 miles, the Platforms (8960 ft) campsites are reached. Shortly after, the trail crosses a moraine field and reaches the Meadows (9200 ft) camping area after another 1.0 miles.    At the Meadows, a small log bridge will greet you to the left.  Stay right and follow the trail as it begins to switchback up toward Spalding Falls.   Above the falls, the trail continues climbing until reaching the Lower and Upper Moraine campsites.   Above the Upper Moraine campsites the Lower Saddle headwall will appear directly to the west.  Use the fixed rope to ascend the class 3/4 headwall section.   A short hike above the headwall will end at the Lower Saddle.   &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If climbing North Face routes or the East Ridge, your trailhead will be the same, but you will go go right to Amphitheater Lake at the second fork (3.2 miles from Lupine Meadow trailhead).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Refer to the left side-bar for a list of available routes to the summit.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://www.summitpost.com/mountains/photo_link.pl?photo_id=36829&amp;amp;object_id=1547&amp;amp;type=mountain&amp;amp;mountain_id=1547&amp;amp;route_id=\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"http://www.summitpost.com/images/thumb/16850.JPG\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;a href=\"http://www.summitpost.com/mountains/photo_link.pl?photo_id=73210&amp;amp;object_id=140&amp;amp;type=new#51722\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"http://www.summitpost.com/images/thumb/41731.JPG\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=121932\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/121932.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_3\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Red Tape&lt;/h2&gt;Grand Teton is located inside &lt;a href=\"http://www.nps.gov/grte/index.htm\"&gt;Grand Teton National Park&lt;/a&gt;. There is a $25.00 entrance fee (per vehicle) to the park which will also get you into Yellowstone (Good for 7 days).   See more info below for other entrance fees.  No permits or fees are required to climb; however, a check-in with the Jenny Lake Ranger Station is recommended. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Backcountry Camping Permits:&lt;/b&gt;  Permits are needed for backcountry camping if using a high camp.  Free permits are available at the Jenny Lake Ranger Station on a first come, first served basis. A limited number of permits can be made in advance by submitting your request in writing to the address or FAX number below. Reservations may be made as early as January 1 and are accepted up to May 15. Although the permit is free, there is a $15.00 non-refundable reservation fee. For more information call (307) 739-3397 or (307) 739-3309. Even though you have a reserved permit, you must pick up your permit in person by 10:00 am the morning of your trip or they will make it available to others.   &lt;a href=\"http://www.nps.gov/grte/pubs/brochures/backcountry.pdf\"&gt;Backcountry Camping Brochure (PDF)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Grand Teton National Park&lt;br&gt;Permits Office&lt;br&gt;P.O. Drawer 170&lt;br&gt;Moose, WY   83012&lt;br&gt;FAX: (307) 739-3438&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;SOME ADVICE ON PERMITS&lt;/b&gt;:  There are advantages to both getting your permits in advance and advantages to waiting and getting them the day before your climb.   If you get your permits in advance, you are guaranteed a permit, but your climb day is at the mercy of the weather.  If you wait and get your permits the day before your climb (on a first-come-first-serve basis), you can look at the forecast while you\'re there and choose which weather day offers the best chance of success for your climb.  However, you then take the chance that everyone else is doing the same thing and you won\'t get a permit.  The other disadvantage to getting your permits while there is that they only issue permits the day before, so you have to waste a entire morning \"getting a permit\" when you could be climbing instead.   Most people have no problems getting the permits they need while there but you need to the permit office VERY early (long before they open at 8:00 am). &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;ENTRANCE FEES&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Vehicle single entry $25.00 for 7 Days, $12.00 per person for single hiker or bicyclist, or $20.00 per motorcycle.  You may also purchase an \"America The Beautiful Federal Lands Recreational Pass\" for $80.00 which is good for entrance to all National Parks, National Forests, BLM, US Fish &amp;amp; Wildlife, and Bureau of Reclamation sites for one year from date of purchase. If you\'re disabled, you may want to get an Access Pass which are free and good for a lifetime. If you\'re 62 years of age or older, a Senior Pass can be purchased for $10 and they\'re also good for a lifetime. &lt;a href=\"http://www.nps.gov/fees_passes.htm\"&gt;Click here&lt;/a&gt; for more info on fees and passes.  Existing National Park Passes and Golden Age/Access/and Eagle Passes will be honored until they expire.

July is the driest summer month while June is the wettest.   However, that is an average over several years.  It can storm and rain for days on end during any month.   Like typical Rockies weather, the Tetons are notorious for violent afternoon thunderstorms, so get an early start.   Plan on being off the mountain by early afternoon.    However, it has also been known to storm at any time of the day including early in the morning.    Sometimes the weather clears and high pressure moves in for several days of storm-free climbing.    &lt;br&gt;&lt;div align=\"center\" class=\"image-left\" style=\"width: 406px;\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=817231\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/medium/817231.JPG\" alt=\"North Face/Ridge of the Grand Teton\" style=\"width: 400px; height: 300px;\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=\"caption\"&gt;Clouds over the North Face/Ridge of the Grand Teton as seen from high on Mount Owen. It is prudent to reach the summit or bail point as early in the day as possible. Even if the forecast is clear, unexpected squalls and storms have a tendency to form in the mid to late afternoon. Downclimbing wet, technical terrain in the dark is not a fun time.

People have been killed by lighning strikes on the Grand, so it is best to avoid climbing when bad weather is forecast. It is better to come back and climb the peak another time than to risk your life trying to outrun a thunderstorm.

The Ranch offers very rustic accommodations for only $20/per night.    Very rustic means you bring your own bedding, mattress, etc., and you will be sharing a cabin with other climbers.  Showers and a cooking area are available.   Lodging is on a first come, first served basis but reservations are accepted. You can make an &lt;a href=\"https://americanalpineclub.org/gtcr_reservations\"&gt;online reservation here&lt;/a&gt; or call (307) 733-7271 between June 1 and September 30.    You do not have to be a member of the American Alpine Club to stay there; however, the AAC rate is only $10.00/night.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;AAC Grand Teton Climbers Ranch:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;ATTN: Manager &lt;br&gt;P.O.

Temperatures can vary from moderate to sub-freezing.  July is considered the best month to climb with the least average precipitation.   Rock fall is very common in the Tetons and Grand Teton is no exception.   Trailhead elevations are approximately 6800-7000 ft and tree line is at approximately 9000 ft.   The &lt;a href=\"http://www.nps.gov/grte/pphtml/facilities.html\"&gt;Jenny Lake Ranger Station&lt;/a&gt; is the headquarters for Teton climbing.   Call the ranger station at (307) 739-3343 (summer) or (307) 739-3309 (winter) for current conditions.   Also, don\'t forget to go to the webcam link at the top of the page to get current conditions and a live webcam view of the Grand.

But when you ask a non-climber or someone outside of Colorado, nobody has heard of it.  However, that&rsquo;s their loss, because Mt. Elbert is a spectacular peak and worthy of recognition and respect from all.   One of the great things about Mt. Elbert is the relatively moderate terrain to the summit, allowing almost anyone with reasonable fitness to enjoy the mountain and its status.   &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Located in the Sawatch Range of the Colorado Rockies, Mt. Elbert was named for Samuel Elbert who was a controversial territorial governor of Colorado in 1873.   The first recorded summit of the peak was by H.W. Stuckle of the Haydon Survey in 1874.   Since that time, it has been climbed by thousands and even been summited by jeep.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In the seventies, there was a movement among a group of folks that felt Mt. Elbert\'s next door neighbor, Mt. Massive, was more deserving to be Colorado\'s highest peak. They stacked rocks in an attempt to raise the height of Massive\'s summit on top. Many more detractors would tear the summit cairn down upon their visits, so the attempt at changing Massive\'s elevation was eventually given up and Mt. Elbert has retained the title as the highest.  (Courtesy of &lt;a href=\"http://www.summitpost.com/mountains/user_link.pl/user_id/2043\"&gt;Aaron Johnson&lt;/a&gt;).   Although most (or all) guidebooks list Mt. Elbert as 14,433 ft., a 2002 recalculation of old surveyed elevations, resulting in a world-wide adjustment of peak elevations, concluded that Mt. Elbert is actually 14,440 ft.   &lt;a href=\"http://www.skyrunner.com/story/coheights.htm\"&gt;Denver post article&lt;/a&gt;. Despite this re-survey, most Colorado Climbers regularly use the old survey elevations. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There are five main routes to the summit, the two most popular and easiest are the South Mt. Elbert Trail and the North Mt. Elbert Trail, both being well trodden class one trails.  These relatively easy paths to the summit are busy in the summer, attracting all types of hikers and climbers, young and old.   Like any high peak, weather, altitude, and personal ability must be considered before attempting Mt. Elbert.   But with a little preparation and planning, Mt. Elbert offers a wonderful climbing and outdoor experience.  &lt;b&gt;The most important thing to remember about climbing this mountain (or any other in Colorado) is to start early....like sunrise....to avoid dangerous afternoon storms.   If you see dark puffy clouds building, turn around and get off the mountain.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div class=\"image\" style=\"width:500px;\" align=\"center\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=233116\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/medium/233116.JPG\" alt=\"Fall &amp;amp; Winter\" style=\"\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=\"caption\"&gt;Fall and winter battle it out on Mount Elbert&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_3\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Getting There&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div class=\"image-right\" style=\"width: 506px;\" align=\"center\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"/the-south-approach-looking/17982\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"The South approach looking...\" src=\"/images/medium/17982.jpg\" style=\"\" height=\"375\" width=\"500\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=\"caption\"&gt;The South approach looking past peak 13,227. Photo by cliffhanger51&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;Mt. Elbert is located in central Colorado near the little town of Twin Lakes about 140 miles west of Denver, 50 miles south of Vail, and 40 miles east of Aspen.   The closest large town is Leadville, approximately 16 miles northeast.    &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The trailheads for routes are: South Mt. Elbert Trail Trailhead for the east ridge route, North Mt. Elbert Trail Trailhead for the northeast ridge, South Halfmoon Creek Trailhead for the northwest ridge,  Black Cloud Trailhead for southeast ridge, and Echo Canyon Trailhead for the southwest ridge route.    Please note the &lt;a href=\"http://www.summitpost.com/mountains/photo_link.pl/p/photo_id__51659__object_id__634__type__user__mountain_id____route_id____user_id____order_by____limit__\"&gt;below photo and route graphics&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=\"http://www.summitpost.com/mountains/user_link.pl?user_id=634\"&gt;Kane&lt;/a&gt; which shows several of the less common routes and variations of routes of Mt. Elbert.    The most popular and standard routes for Mt. Elbert are the South Mount Elbert Trail and the North Mount Elbert Trail as described below.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;South Mt. Elbert Trailhead:&lt;/b&gt; (9560 ft) From Leadville, drive south approximately 10 miles to the intersection of U.S. 24 and Colorado (CO) 82. From Buena Vista drive north 20 miles to the same intersection. Once on CO 82, drive west 4 miles to Lake County Road 24 (Do not confuse with U.S. 24). Turn right (north) on Lake County 24 and drive one mile to Lakeview Campground. The trailhead is on the northwest side of the campground and is also an access point for the Colorado/Continental Divide Trail in which a short section runs from Lakeview to the North Mt. Elbert Trailhead. Shortly after Lakeview Campground, turn left into an obvious parking area, overlook, and dirt road. High clearance vehicles can drive to 10,440 ft. by driving west past the parking lot on a rough road for 2 miles until the road ends and you see other vehicles parked. The upper trailhead is on the north side of the parking area. Cross a creek via a footbridge and continue a short distance until reaching a signed intersection of the Mt. Elbert/Colorado/Continental Divide Trail where you turn left.   See the left side bar or click here for the &lt;a href=\"http://www.summitpost.org/route/322285/south-mt-elbert-trail.html\"&gt;South Mt. Elbert Trail&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;North Mt. Elbert Trailhead:&lt;/b&gt; (10,050 ft.)   From Leadville, drive 3.5 miles south on U.S. 24 to Colorado (CO) 300.  Turn right (west) on CO 300 and drive .7 miles.    At .7 miles, turn left (south) on Lake County 11 which is a newly paved road.   Drive south 1.8 miles on Lake County 11 and turn right (west) at the signed intersection for Halfmoon Creek.   Continue southwest past the Halfmoon Creek Campground and the Elbert Creek Campground until reaching the signed North Mt. Elbert Trailhead at 6.9 miles.  Note:  This trailhead is also referred to as \"South Colorado/Main Range Trailhead\" in some guidebooks.  It is an access point for the Colorado/Continental Divide trail, a short section of which runs from here to the Lakeview Campground to the south.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;South Halfmoon Creek Trailhead:&lt;/b&gt; (10,240)    Follow directions to the North Mt. Elbert Trailhead except ï»¿continue another 2.1 miles to the signed South Halfmoon Creek trailhead.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Black Cloud Trailhead:&lt;/b&gt; (9700 ft)     From the intersection of U.S. 24 and CO 82:   West on CO 82 for 10.5 miles to a right turn (north) to the signed trailhead.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Echo Canyon Trailhead:&lt;/b&gt; (10,000 ft)   From the intersection of U.S. 24 and CO 82:   West on CO 82 for 12.5 miles to a right turn (north) where there is a cabin and a sign for Echo Canyon.&lt;a name=\"chapter_4\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Red Tape&lt;/h2&gt;No permits or fees are required to park, climb, or hike.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Mt. Elbert is located in the &lt;a href=\"http://www.fs.fed.us/r2/psicc/leadvile/\"&gt;Leadville Ranger District&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"http://www.fs.fed.us/r2/psicc/index.shtml\"&gt;San Isabel National Forest&lt;/a&gt;.   &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Leadville Ranger District, San Isabel National Forest, 2013 N. Poplar, Leadville, CO   80461    Phone:   (719) 486-0749   Fax:  (719) 486-0928.&lt;a name=\"chapter_5\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;When To Climb&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;div class=\"image-left\" style=\"width: 506px;\" align=\"center\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"/this-is-on-the-south-mt/21939\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"This is on the South Mt....\" src=\"/images/medium/21939.jpg\" style=\"\" height=\"375\" width=\"500\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=\"caption\"&gt;Mt. Elbert in June. Photo by Alan Ellis&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br&gt;As with most Colorado high peaks, June through September is considered the summer climbing season.   However, Mt. Elbert is also climbed in the dead of winter by experienced mountaineers.   It is a popular ski mountaineering destination due to low avalanche danger on several of the routes.   Louis Dawson recommends using the South Mt. Elbert Trail and the North Mt. Elbert Trail for winter ascents.   Violent thunderstorms are a daily occurance in summer.    Plan to be off the summit or ridges by early afternoon to avoid lightning danger.   Start very early and allow 6-8 hours for climb and descent.&lt;a name=\"chapter_6\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Winter Climbing of Mt. Elbert&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div class=\"image-left\" style=\"width: 506px;\" align=\"center\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=373049\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/medium/373049.jpg\" alt=\"Elbert January 2008\" style=\"width: 500px; height: 207.24346076458752px;\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;Winter alpenglow on Mount Elbert&lt;/div&gt;Winter is a great time to climb Mt. Elbert.  Afternoon thunderstorms are not an issue, but winter brings an entire new set of conditions that must be considered.  The standard winter route is via the east ridge (South Mt. Elbert Trail) which begins at the overlook near Lakeview Campground.  The 4WD road to the upper trailhead is closed in winter.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This is a great winter route because there is no avalanche danger if you stick to the route.   However, do not take the mountain lightly in winter.  Since the 4WD road is closed, this equates to an 11-mile round-trip climb.  Due to the distance, some climb Mt. Elbert in winter as an overnighter, with a camp either at the 4WD upper trailhead or on the shoulder in the conifer just below treeline.  But most still climb it in a one-day push....however, expect a LONG day.   The road to the upper 4WD trailhead is easy to follow and snowshoes will sometimes be needed.  Once at the upper trailhead, the route finding can be tricky because the trail cannot be seen (due to snow).   Once you reach the upper trailhead, cross the footbridge and head northeast past the ponds (on the right) until reaching &lt;a href=\"http://www.jackieandalan.com/images/elberttrailhead.jpg\"&gt;this sign&lt;/a&gt; a short distance later.   Continue past the sign approximately 200 yards until coming to a second sign where you turn a hard left (northwest).   Climb northwest up the steep slope through the aspen forest.  With luck, you\'ll run into the switchbacks, but if not, the general rule is to head directly northwest until reaching the shoulder just below treeline.   Normally, previous hikers have created a \"trench\" in the snow to follow, but after a large fresh snowfall, the trench may not be evident.  Also, there are sometimes orange ribbons tied to trees to mark the winter route up through the apens.  Once on the shoulder, follow the standard route using the maps below.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;u&gt;Gear:&lt;/u&gt;  Ice axe and crampons are generally not needed; however, conditions may dictate otherwise.   Normally, snowshoes are a &lt;b&gt;MUST&lt;/b&gt; from the trailhead until reaching treeline, but sometimes they are needed all the way to the top depending on conditions and/or recent snow and winds.  Or....they may not be needed at all if the snow is hard packed.  The upper ridge above treeline is windswept and snowshoes are not generally needed.&lt;a name=\"chapter_7\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Camping and Lodging&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;div class=\"image-left\" style=\"width: 506px;\" align=\"center\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"/beaver-lake/204101\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Beaver lake\" src=\"/images/medium/204101.jpg\" style=\"\" height=\"375\" width=\"500\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=\"caption\"&gt;Beaver Lake.

The closest to the South Mt. Elbert trail is Lakeview Campground as described in \"Getting There\" section.  Lakeview has a campground host  from May 15 until September 8.   It has 59 sites at $12.00/night and will accomodate an RV up to 32 ft.    Drinking water, pit and flushing toilets, no showers.   &lt;a href=\"http://www.reserveusa.com/jsp/commonpage.jsp?goto=/nrrs/co/lav1/newindex.html\"&gt;Reservations&lt;/a&gt; may be made at Lakeview Campground.  The closest campgrounds to Halfmoon Creek and North Mt. Elbert Trailheads are Halfmoon Creek Campground and Elbert Creek Campground located on the road to the trailheads as described in the \"Getting There\" section.   Elbert Creek has 17 sites at $13.00/night and will accomodate up to a 16 ft trailer.   Open from May 30 to September 30, it has drinking water, pit toilets, but no showers.    Halfmoon Creek has 24 sites at $13.00/night and will accomodate up to 16 ft trailer.   Open from May 20 to September 30, it has drinking water, pit toilet, but no showers.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There are approximately nine other Forest Service campgrounds nearby.    Call the Forest Service at (719) 486-0749 or see their website.   They will send you a packet with free information.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Primitive camping is allowed pretty much anywhere on the mountain.  Avoid camping along the 4wd road, next to a trail, or in the parking areas.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Sugar Loafin\' RV Park and Camground:   4 miles west of Leadville on CO 300.   (719) 486-1031.

Showers available.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Lodging:    In Twin Lakes, &lt;a href=\"http://www.twinlakesnordicinn.com\"&gt;The Nordic Inn Bed and Breakfast&lt;/a&gt; is the best place to stay for Mt. Elbert climbers.  John Slater, owner, has being running the Nordic for 18 years and is an expert on the mountain.  The Nordic Inn is highly recommended.    Further down highway 82, the &lt;a href=\"http://www.vtinet.com/mtelbert/\"&gt;Mt. Elbert Lodge&lt;/a&gt;, B&amp;amp;B and cabins, is within walking distance to two trailheads, Black Cloud and Echo Canyon.  &lt;a href=\"http://www.leadvilleusa.com/\"&gt;Leadville&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"http://www.aspenalive.com\"&gt;Aspen&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"http://www.fourteenernet.com/buenavista/\"&gt;Buena Vista&lt;/a&gt; offer the closest hotels, motels, and bed and breakfasts outside of Twin Lakes.   Aspen, to the west, also has lodging but is considerably more expensive.    There is a hostel in Leadville at 500 E. 7th which has $3.00 showers and rooms for $15.00/night.  (719) 486-9334.&lt;a name=\"chapter_8\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Mountain Conditions&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most of the trails to the summit are well maintained and easy to follow.   In fact, in some sections above treeline, the trails have become multi-trails where people have started new ones to avoid the deep ruts of the old trails.   Try to avoid starting new trails and stick to the established path to minimize impact.

Although much more famous than the true Wyoming state highpoint, Grand Teton is actually shorter by a mere 34\' elevation. In reality, the highest point in Wyoming is actually Gannett Peak (13804\'), a massive and remote summit located in the Wind River Range nearly 70 miles southeast of Grand Teton.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div align=\"center\" class=\"image\" style=\"width: 506px;\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"/gannett-peak-in-the-morning/115295\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Gannett Peak in the morning...\" height=\"348\" width=\"500\" src=\"/images/medium/115295.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=\"caption\"&gt;Gannett Peak (Photo credit: David Kiene)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br&gt;Although most famous for being the Wyoming state highpoint, Gannett Peak is also notable for multiple other reasons. In example, the mountain is the highest point of two counties (Fremont, Sublette). The peak is also the highest point of two National Forests (Bridger-Teton, Shoshone) as well as two Wilderness Areas (Bridger, Fitzpatrick). The mountain is also the highest point of three drainage basins (Yellowstone, Bighorn, Green).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Gannett Peak is the fifth-highest state highpoint. In addition, with 290 miles of isolation from a higher peak, the mountain is also the most isolated peak in Wyoming and the ninth-most isolated peak in the contiguous USA. With 7076\' of clean prominence, the mountain is the most prominent peak in Wyoming and the 15th-most prominent peak in the contiguous USA.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;From a mountaineering perspective, Gannett Peak has an assortment of challenges associated with it. The mountain is the 3rd-highest \"Triple Crown\" county highpoint, which is a peak that has a minimum of 5000\' of clean prominence, requires a minimum of 5000\' elevation gain from a passenger vehicle road, and is on the \"Apex\" list of most difficult county highpoints in the contiguous USA. Gannett Peak is the fourth-highest peak on the \"Apex\" list and easily one of the most remote.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div align=\"center\" class=\"image\" style=\"width: 381px;\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"/gannett-peak/355489\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Gannett Peak\" height=\"500\" width=\"375\" src=\"/images/medium/355489.JPG\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=\"caption\"&gt;Mixture Of Snow, Ice, and Rock&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br&gt;Any summit attempt of Gannett Peak requires a wide variety of mountaineering skills. Considered as one of the most difficult state highpoints, the only other state highpoints that either rival or exceed its technical difficulty are Denali (Alaska), Mount Rainier (Washington), and Granite Peak (Montana). It is debatable whether or not the latter two are actually more difficult than Gannett Peak, depending on experience, skills, weather, and conditions.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div align=\"center\" class=\"image\" style=\"width: 381px;\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"/climbers-on-gannett-peak/646643\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Climbers on Gannett Peak\" height=\"500\" width=\"375\" src=\"/images/medium/646643.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=\"caption\"&gt;Mountaineers on Gannett Peak (Photo credit: \"Holsti97\")&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_2\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Standard Approaches&lt;/h2&gt;Any summit attempt of Gannett Peak should be considered a backcountry trip. Although a few mountaineers have been able to summit the peak within 24 hours, most people require 3-5 days. There are two standard approaches for the peak, each with its advantages and disadvantages. There are also some route variations, too.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_3\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h3&gt;STANDARD APPROACH FROM EAST (Dubois, WY):&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://www.summitpost.org/glacier-trail/530102\"&gt;Glacier Trail&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/b&gt;:&lt;br&gt;-&amp;gt; 50 miles roundtrip with approximately 10750\' cumulative elevation gain.&lt;br&gt;This route is the longest standard approach for any state highpoint in the contiguous USA. As a result, sometimes this route gets overlooked. However, it can be considered short-sighted to only look at its mileage and elevation gain.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In reality, this route only has 10 more miles and 1700\' cumulative elevation gain than the other standard approach (from the west), which converts to only five extra miles and 850\' extra gain each way. The biggest advantage to this route is on summit day, due to a closer high camp (i.e. shorter summit day provides higher potential of success) and less strenuous terrain than the western standard approach.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div align=\"center\" class=\"image\" style=\"width: 506px;\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"/gannett-peak-from-glacier-trail/878127\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Gannett Peak From Glacier Trail\" height=\"375\" width=\"500\" src=\"/images/medium/878127.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=\"caption\"&gt;Glacier Peak, as seen from Glacier Trail&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br&gt;------------&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_4\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h3&gt;STANDARD APPROACH FROM WEST (Pinedale, WY):&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://www.summitpost.org/pole-creek-trail-seneca-lake-trail-india/155536\"&gt;Pole Creek Trail to Titcomb Basin&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/b&gt;:&lt;br&gt;-&amp;gt; 40 miles roundtrip with approximately 9050\' cumulative elevation gain.&lt;br&gt;This route has long been considered the main standard approach for Gannett Peak, although for the reasons mentioned above the Glacier Trail approach from the east has been gaining popularity during recent years. The western approach is a well-travelled route full of spectacular scenery and views.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;However, despite an overall shorter route and less cumulative elevation gain, summit day is where it loses its most advantages over the eastern standard approach. The necessity to climb over Bonney Pass (also known as Dinwoody Pass) requires an elevation loss of approximately 1200\' during the approach to Gannett Peak, which of course becomes an extra elevation gain of 1200\' when returning back to camp from the peak. The extra mileage, gains, and losses on summit day can sometimes double-up the time required on that day, when compared with the eastern standard approach.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div align=\"center\" class=\"image\" style=\"width: 506px;\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"/titcomb-basin/207928\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Titcomb Basin\" height=\"375\" width=\"500\" src=\"/images/medium/207928.JPG\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=\"caption\"&gt;Titcomb Basin, via Western Approach&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br&gt;------------&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_5\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h3&gt;ROUTE VARIATIONS:&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://www.summitpost.org/ink-wells-gooseneck-glacier/159310\"&gt;Ink Wells Trail&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/b&gt;:&lt;br&gt;The advantage of this route is that a large amount of distance and effort can be saved by the time the route intersects with the Glacier Trail. However, the disadvantage of this route is that access is both limited and expensive. This route crosses the Wind River Indian Reservation, which requires special permission, guidance, and transportation to travel through. Reservations are required in advance and sometimes difficult to achieve, and even if a reservation can be made the cost can be substantial (hundreds of dollars, total).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div align=\"center\" class=\"image\" style=\"width: 506px;\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"/on-the-ink-wells-trail/11224\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"On the Ink Wells trail...\" height=\"375\" width=\"500\" src=\"/images/medium/11224.JPG\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=\"caption\"&gt;Gannett Peak, as seen from Ink Wells Trail&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;a href=\"&amp;lt;b\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://www.summitpost.org/tourist-creek/536366\"&gt;Tourist Creek Route&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/b&gt;:&lt;br&gt;The advantage of this route is that it is shorter than the standard approaches and ascends the steep west face of Gannett Peak. The disadvantage of this route is that there is a large amount of routefinding, bushwhacking, and technical rock climbing involved.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://www.summitpost.org/wells-creek/536454\"&gt;Wells Creek Route&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/b&gt;:&lt;br&gt;The advantage of this route is that it is shorter than the standard approaches and ascends the steep west face of Gannett Peak.

Some people might also opt to have local outfitters help porter mountaineering parties and gear along the standard approaches, although for a substantial fee.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Regardless of route, any approach of Gannett Peak must be taken seriously as a true mountain climb. Potential summiters needs to be prepared for long hikes, possible routefinding, inclement weather and terrain conditions, steep snow and ice, glacier travel, and scrambling. Mountaineering skills are required; this peak is not recommended for amateur hikers.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div align=\"center\" class=\"image\" style=\"width: 506px;\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"/climbing-above-the-bergschrund/651501\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Climbing Above the Bergschrund\" height=\"375\" width=\"500\" src=\"/images/medium/651501.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=\"caption\"&gt;Climbing the upper Gooseneck Glacier&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_6\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Driving Directions&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_7\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h3&gt;FOR STANDARD APPROACH FROM EAST (Dubois, WY):&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;STARTING AT DUBOIS, WY:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;1) Drive approximately 4.0 miles south along Highway 26/287 to Whiskey Basin/Trail Lake Road, within a block of crossing a bridge over Jakeys Fork.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;2) Turn right onto Whiskey Basin/Trail Lake Road, and then take an immediate left. This road turns into Forest Road #411.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;3) Continue following the road (Forest Road #411) for 9.2 miles until its end at the Trail Lake Ranch parking area. The trailhead for Glacier Trail, Bomber Basin, and Whiskey Mountain originates at this location.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div align=\"center\" class=\"image\" style=\"width: 506px;\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"/trailhead-for-glacier-trail/530147\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Trailhead For Glacier Trail\" height=\"375\" width=\"500\" src=\"/images/medium/530147.JPG\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=\"caption\"&gt;Trailhead for Glacier Trail&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br&gt;------------&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_8\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h3&gt;STANDARD APPROACH FROM WEST (Pinedale, WY):&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;STARTING AT PINEDALE, WY:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;1) At the east end of town, where Highway 191 begins to bend south, turn left onto Fremont Lake Road.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;2) After approximately 3.0 miles along Fremont Lake Road, the roadway splits. Take the right fork, onto Forest Road 134 (also known as Skyline Drive).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;3) Follow Skyline Drive for approximately 11.2 miles until its end at the Trails End Campground and Elkhart Park parking area. The trailhead for Pole Creek Trail originates at this location.&lt;br&gt;-&amp;gt; For reference purposes, the parking area is located only a short distance beyond the Elkhart Park Ranger Station.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div align=\"center\" class=\"image\" style=\"width: 506px;\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"/the-wind-river-range-as-seen/595\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"The Wind River range as seen...\" height=\"338\" width=\"500\" src=\"/images/medium/595.JPG\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=\"caption\"&gt;Trailhead for Pole Creek Trail&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_9\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Red Tape&lt;/h2&gt;No special permits are required for the standard approaches of Gannett Peak. However, standard wilderness rules and regulations apply.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If a trail register is present at a trailhead, sign-in at the beginning of the trek and sign-out upon return.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Large groups (8+ people) visiting the region might require a special group permit prior to any trip.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Contact a local ranger district for current rules, regulations, and route conditions prior to any trip to this area.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_10\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;When To Climb&lt;/h2&gt;The optimum climbing season for Gannett Peak is June through September. Most climbers visit the peak during July and August. Far less snow is encountered along the standard approaches during August, but many climbing parties prefer visiting during July when the Gooseneck Glacier bergschrund (and other crevasses) are not yet fully opened (if at all). Snowpack can actually make a summit attempt less strenuous than travelling on ice and/or rock for long distances.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div align=\"center\" class=\"image\" style=\"width: 381px;\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"/gannett-peak-trip-bergschrund/530000\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Gannett Peak Trip - Bergschrund\" height=\"500\" width=\"375\" src=\"/images/medium/530000.JPG\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=\"caption\"&gt;Gooseneck Glacier bergschrund starting to open...&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br&gt;A few people attempt and climb Gannett Peak off-season, but it is not recommended due to inclement off-season weather, snow blizzards, avalanches, and possibly snowed-in roads leading to trailheads.&lt;a name=\"chapter_11\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Camping&lt;/h2&gt;Backcountry camping is permitted within both Bridger Wilderness and Fitzpatrick Wilderness.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div align=\"center\" class=\"image\" style=\"width: 506px;\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"/gannett-peak-trip-high-camp/530020\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Gannett Peak Trip - High Camp\" height=\"375\" width=\"500\" src=\"/images/medium/530020.JPG\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=\"caption\"&gt;High Camp Along Eastern Approach&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_12\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Mountain Conditions&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;For current conditions for the eastern standard approach to Gannett Peak:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Wind River Ranger District, Shoshone National Forest&lt;br&gt;ADDRESS: 1403 West Ramshorn, Dubois, WY 82513&lt;br&gt;TELEPHONE: 307-455-2466&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;For current conditions for the western standard approach to Gannett Peak:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Pinedale Ranger District, Bridger-Teton National Forest&lt;br&gt;ADDRESS: 29 East Fremont Lake Road, Pinedale, WY 92941&lt;br&gt;TELEPHONE: 307-367-4326&lt;a name=\"chapter_13\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Historical Facts&lt;/h2&gt;Gannett Peak was officially named during 1906, in honor of &lt;a href=\"http://www.amerisurv.com/content/view/4519/153/\"&gt;Henry Gannett&lt;/a&gt;. Gannett had been a Chief Geographer for the United States Geological Society as well as one of the founding members of the National Geographic Society. During his lifetime, Gannett was well-known for his topographical work and in doing so became regarded as the \"Father of the Quadrangle.\" During 1890, he was responsible (in partnership with Thomas Corwin Mendenhall) for helping establish the United States Board on Geographic Names, which started creating official names for locations within the USA.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The first successful summit of Gannett Peak was by Arthur Tate and Floyd Stahlnaker during 1922.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Gannett Glacier, located on the north side of Gannett Peak, is the largest glacier in the Rocky Mountains south of the Canadian border.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div align=\"center\" class=\"image\" style=\"width: 506px;\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"/gannett-glacier/269432\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Gannett Glacier\" height=\"203\" width=\"500\" src=\"/images/medium/269432.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=\"caption\"&gt;Gannett Glacier&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_14\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;External Links&lt;/h2&gt;An excellent resource for attempting Gannett Peak, as well as any other state highpoints, is \"&lt;a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/dp/1463692013/ref=asc_df_14636920132806093?smid=ATVPDKIKX0DER&amp;amp;tag=pg-1583-86-20&amp;amp;linkCode=asn&amp;amp;creative=395097&amp;amp;creativeASIN=1463692013\"&gt;Highpoint Adventures: The Complete Guide to the 50 State Highpoints&lt;/a&gt;\" by Charlie and Diane Winger.

I am very thankful to be able to adopt and continue to provide lots of information about this wonderful peak here on SummitPost. Some of the text below was written by Bob.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"image\" style=\"width: 406px;\" align=\"center\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=303023\"&gt;&lt;img style=\"width: 400px; height: 289.59px;\" alt=\"Kings Peak and South Kings Peak\" src=\"/images/medium/303023.jpg\" unselectable=\"on\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=\"caption\"&gt;Kings Peak and South Kings Peak&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_2\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Overview&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kings Peak is the highpoint of Utah, and of &lt;a href=\"http://cohp.org/ut/utah.html\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;Duchesne County&lt;/a&gt;. It is the seventh highest of the U.S. State Highpoints and located approximately 42 miles north of Duchesne in the High Uintas Wilderness Area of the Ashley and Wasatch National Forests.  The mountain was named after Clarence King, who was the first director of the US Geological Survey.  The standard hiking route is a 28.8 mile round trip trek, so the peak is usually climbed as part of a backpacking trip.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The present-day Kings Peak wasn\'t known to be the highest point in Utah before the mid 1960s. The USGS hadn\'t determined whether the current Kings Peak or South Kings Peak was the highest of the two summits prior to satellite measurements taken in 1966. Prior to this discovery, the USGS had marked South Kings Peak as the highest peak in Utah. Any hikers going to Utah\'s highest peak prior to 1966 would have scaled South Kings Peak instead of the now official Kings Peak. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kings Peak\'s &lt;a href=\"http://www.cohp.org/prominence/index.htm\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;topographic prominence&lt;/a&gt; is 6,348 feet and ranks 19th in the contiguous 48 states. It is one of 57 so-called \"Ultra\" prominence peaks, those with more than 5,000 feet of prominence. For the complete list of Ultras, see &lt;a href=\"http://www.peaklist.org/USlists/USP5000.html\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;this page&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div align=\"center\"&gt;&lt;table class=\"redactor_table\" id=\"table67162\"&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;div class=\"image\" style=\"width: 356px;\" align=\"center\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=417319\"&gt;&lt;img style=\"width: 350px; height: 233.8px;\" alt=\"Kings Peak Tele\" src=\"/images/medium/417319.JPG\" unselectable=\"on\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=\"caption\"&gt;Kings Peak&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;div class=\"image\" style=\"width: 316.32px;\" align=\"center\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=318620\"&gt;&lt;img style=\"width: 310.32px; height: 234px;\" alt=\"Kings at sunset\" src=\"/images/medium/318620.JPG\" unselectable=\"on\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=\"caption\"&gt;Kings Peak at sunset&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;div class=\"image\" style=\"width: 318.73px;\" align=\"center\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=530086\"&gt;&lt;img style=\"width: 312.73px; height: 235px;\" alt=\"South Kings and Kings\" src=\"/images/medium/530086.JPG\" unselectable=\"on\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=\"caption\"&gt;Kings Peak&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_3\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Trailheads&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Henry\'s Fork Trailhead&lt;/b&gt; &lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;This trailhead is on the north side of the range. Take exit 39 off Interstate 80 on Wyoming and turn south on State Route 414. Go 6 miles to Mountain View, WY where route 414 turns west through Mountain View and becomes Route 410 as the road turns south at the west end of town.  Drive Route 410 for 6.7 miles toward Robertson, WY to the point where it turns west.  From this point, drive Uinta County Road 283 (also named Forest Road 072) south toward Grahams Reservoir and Bridger Lake for 12.1 miles to Forest Road 017.  Turn left on Forest Road 017 and continue south 6.8 miles to Forest Road 077.  Drive south on Forest Road 077 for 2.8 miles, and turn right on the road to Henry\'s Fork Campground and the Henry\'s Fork Trailhead. This is the trailhead most people use for a climb of Kings Peak. The hike is beautiful but expect crowds in July and August.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Yellowstone Creek (Swift Creek) Trailhead&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This trailhead is on the south side of the range and although not quite as scenic as the hike from Henry\'s Fork, it offers a very mellow hike up the long Yellowstone Creek Trail. If you\'re coming from the east in Roosevelt, Utah, continue south through town on US Highway 40 / 191. Don\'t head onto UT 121. Follow Highway 40 as it turns back to the southwest and after 5.6 miles, turn right on UT 87 (AKA Ioka Lane) and follow this paved highway for 16.5 miles to the town of Altamont. A quarter-mile west of this town, turn right (north) onto 16,000 West and continue another 4 miles. Turn left onto 8,000 North, then right again on 17,000 West which then curves left and turns into 9,000 North and then into Yellow Stone Road. Cross the Yellow Stone River and continue 5.5 miles on the now gravel road to the forest boundary where the road turns into FR 119. Continue down the hill and pass the Yellowstone Group Campground and Bridge Campground, crossing the river again back to its east side. 4 miles past the Bridge Campground, reach the Swift Creek Campground at the end of the road and park at the trailhead marked by a large sign.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Or, if you are coming from the west in Duchene, turn north onto State Highway 87. Follow State Highway 87 until it joins with State Highway 134 (this is where state Highway 87 heads due east instead of continuing north) between milepost 15 and 16. Follow State Highway 134 (21,000 West) north to the little town of Mountain Home. Where State Highway 134 begins to head due east at Mountain Home, Continue north on 21,000 West and turn right on 20,780 West at the T junction 0.7 miles north of town. Continue on 20,780 West for 4 miles, heading down the hill and turning right onto a short road which crosses the Lake Fork River. After crossing the bridge, turn left (north) on Yellowstone River Road and follow the road to the trailhead at the Swift Creek Campground as described above.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Uinta River Trailhead&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This trailhead is also on the south side of the range and provides a longer, more scenic approach than the Yellowstone Creek route. From the intersection of Highway 121 and Highway 40 in the town of Roosevelt in the Uinta Basin, drive west on 200 North (Highway 121). Stay on Highway 121 as it quickly bends to the north. Most junctions are marked with signs, but they are very hard to read in the dark. At mile 9.9, just after the actual mile marker 10 at a stop sign, at the hamlet of Neola go straight towards Uintah Canyon. At mile 16.7 continue straight. At mile 18, turn right to Uintah Canyon. At mile 21.9 turn right. At mile 22.2 turn left just after the bridge. Park at the trailhead at mile 25.6.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_4\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Approaches&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://www.summitpost.org/swift-creek-yellowstone-creek/160822\"&gt;Swift/Yellowstone Creek Trail&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This approach avoids the crowds of the Henry\'s Fork approach. From the trailhead (see above) hike about a half mile up the Yellowstone Creek Trail to a junction where you have two choices. You can either continue straight up the Yellowstone Creek Trail for 17 uneventful miles to Anderson Pass. This avoids the ups and downs and makes for easy route-finding but the hike through the Yellowstone Creek valley is in the forest nearly the whole way. Only the last couple miles are in the nice alpine meadows above treeline. Yellowstone Creek does form a narrow, deep gorge that you\'ll pass by through the trees which may make the boring hike a little more interesting. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The other option is to turn right shortly after the trailhead and hike the Swift Creek trail to Milk Lake. This trail is much more scenic as it hikes on a ridge crest for a while and passes by a few large beaver ponds before reaching Deer Lake, which is at 10,200 feet and 6 miles from the trailhead. After Deer Lake, continue on the trail and after 0.75 miles, you will come to a junction. Turn left and follow the trail past Farmers Lake and over Bluebell Pass, and then descend to Milk Lake. From Milk Lake, follow the base of the ridge to the east all the way to Anderson Pass. The route passes through many spectacular and beautiful alpine meadows full of wildflowers. There is no trail after Milk Lake, but the cross-country route is easy to find since there are open views and travel is not difficult.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"image\" style=\"width: 406px;\" align=\"center\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=541327\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/medium/541327.JPG\" alt=\"Deer Lake\" style=\"width: 400px; height: 300px;\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=\"caption\"&gt;Deer Lake&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://www.summitpost.org/henry-s-fork-via-anderson-pass/159182\"&gt;Henry\'s Fork&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is the most popular approach for Kings Peak coming from the north side of the range. The trail heads in a Southerly direction on a gradual rise. After about 3 miles and 430 feet of elevation gain, you will intersect with the Alligator Lake trail that heads off to the right. Continue straight for another 2.4 miles where you will come across a sign for the Elkhorn stream crossing to the left. At this point turn left (east) and cross via a log bridge. After crossing continue heading in a southerly direction for another couple miles where you reach Dollar Lake. This is a good spot to camp or you can continue on and setup camp closer to Gunsight Pass. Continue on the main trail to Gunsight Pass and hike the ridge over Gunsight Pass Peak and continue down to Anderson Pass where the North Ridge Route of Kings Peak takes off.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"image\" style=\"width: 406px;\" align=\"center\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=541326\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/medium/541326.JPG\" alt=\"Henry\'s Fork Lake\" style=\"width: 400px; height: 300px;\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=\"caption\"&gt;Henry\'s Fork Lake&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://www.summitpost.org/uinta-river/160820\"&gt;Uinta River Trail&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This approach starts on the south side of the range but approaches Kings Peak from the east. This route is very long tough and rarely done. Allow 2-4 days for this 50 mile round-trip hike. From the trailhead at 7800 feet elevation, follow the trail north along the Uinta River. After about 3.6 miles, you will reach a junction where you turn left and cross Sheep Bridge and onto the Chain Lakes Trail. Follow this steep trail to the Chain Lakes Basin. Lower Chain Lake is about 9.2 miles from the trailhead and at 10,580 feet elevation. The 4th Chain Lake is 1.8 miles beyond at 10,900 feet elevation. Any of these lakes make a fine campsite. From the upper Chain Lake, take the trail over Roberts Pass to the Lake Atwood Basin, and then over Trail Rider Pass to Painter Basin. You could follow the trail all the way to Anderson Pass, but the shortest way is to climb the east face of Kings directly and moot the north ridge. There is a lot of boulder hopping but doesn\'t exceed Class 2.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"image\" style=\"width: 406px;\" align=\"center\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=59933\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/medium/59933.jpg\" alt=\"Emmons (right center), July...\" style=\"width: 400px; height: 264px;\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=\"caption\"&gt;Painter Basin&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_5\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;North Ridge Standard Route - Class 1+&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is the standard route on Kings Peak and regardless on which approach you take (with the possible exception of the Uinta River Trail), the route begins at Anderson Pass. From the pass, hike south on the ridge to the summit. It\'s actually pretty simple and only takes about an hour from Anderson Pass and there is a worn boot path most of the way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"image\" style=\"width:500px;\" align=\"center\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=634152\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/medium/634152.JPG\" alt=\"Kings Peak\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=\"caption\"&gt;Kings Peak\'s North Ridge on the right skyline&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_6\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Kings-Emmons Ridge Run&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=\"http://www.summitpost.org/kings-emmons-ridge/160824\"&gt;Kings to Emmons&lt;/a&gt; ridge-run is arguably the highest sustained ridge-crest in the entire Rocky Mountain chain outside of Colorado. It provides a fantastic peak-bagging adventure and endurance test as you will pass over seven 13ers if you complete the ridge. For climbers wanting to try this long hike, the best place to start is the Yellowstone/Swift Creek trailhead and make a huge loop out of the ridge. When I did it, I hiked all the way up to Anderson Pass on the Yellowstone Creek Trail all night long, then headed south on the ridge getting the first five of the peaks before tiring out and bailing down into the upper Timothy Lakes basin and hiking out the Swift Creek Trail. You can get all 7 peaks before descending Swift Creek but make sure there is no chance for thunderstorms to develop as you will be way above treeline for many hours. Other nearby 13ers like \"Henry\'s Fork Peak\" and Gunsight Peak can also be tagged. The loop can also be done in the opposite direction. The peaks on the ridge from north to south are as follows:&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div align=\"center\"&gt;&lt;table class=\"redactor_table\" id=\"table57200\" style=\"width: 600px; background-color: rgb(198, 217, 240);\"&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Name&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Elevation (ft)&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Prominence (ft)&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Kings Peak&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;13,528&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;6,358&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;South Kings Peak&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;13,512&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;372&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;\"Trail Rider Peak\"&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;13,247&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;362&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;\"Painter Peak\"&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;13,387&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;329&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;\"Roberts Peak\"&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;13,287&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;543&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;\"North Emmons\"&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;13,068&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;481&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Mount Emmons&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;13,440&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;930&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div align=\"center\"&gt;&lt;table class=\"redactor_table\" id=\"table1636\"&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;div class=\"image\" style=\"width: 456px;\" align=\"center\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=129727\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/medium/129727.jpg\" alt=\"Kings-Emmons Ridge as viewed...\" style=\"width: 450px; height: 212.4px;\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=\"caption\"&gt;Kings-Emmons Ridge...North (Mount Emmons) is to the left&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div class=\"image\" style=\"width: 456px;\" align=\"center\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=810029\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/medium/810029.JPG\" alt=\"South Kings Peak\" style=\"width: 450px; height: 337.5px;\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=\"caption\"&gt;Looking south to South Kings Peak&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;div class=\"image\" style=\"width: 497.848px;\" align=\"center\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=884717\"&gt;&lt;img style=\"width: 491.848px; height: 580px;\" src=\"/images/medium/884717.jpg\" alt=\"Kings-Emmons Ridge Map\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=\"caption\"&gt;Map showing the Kings-Emmons ridge-run loop (first 5 peaks).

Camping is also available at any of the lakes on the flanks of the peak. Water can be found in abundance in all the basins on all sides of the mountain. Many people camp at one of the many ponds and tarns north of Gunsight Pass on the Henry\'s Fork approach or around treeline on the Yellowstone Creek approach.

Ever year there is something different, sometimes a few registers, sometimes none. There used to be a Highpoint plaque in late 90s, and a geocache around 2002-2004, and a fallen officer plaque in 2005, but all of them end up being removed from the top as unapproved in the designated wilderness. I guess the latest plaque actually has been approved, but by a wrong office of the FS, so it had to go in the end.&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td valign=\"bottom\" style=\"padding-top: 6px;\" colspan=\"2\"&gt;&lt;span style=\"font-size: 9px; color: #888;\"&gt;Posted Jan 28, 2006 2:24 pm&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;table border=\"0\" width=\"775\" class=\"messages\"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td width=\"110\" align=\"left\" valign=\"top\" style=\"padding-top: 6px;\"&gt;&lt;a name=\"121366\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a class=\"dis_user_lnk\" href=\"/users/powerjl/25722\"&gt;POWERJL&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td valign=\"top\" style=\"padding-top: 6px;\"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Untitled Comment&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td align=\"right\" valign=\"top\" nowrap style=\"font-size: 10px;\"&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td valign=\"top\" rowspan=\"2\" align=\"left\" style=\"padding-top: 6px;\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=\"font-size: 9px; color: #888;\"&gt;Hasn\'t voted&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td colspan=\"2\" style=\"padding-top: 6px;\"&gt;The majority of folks heading up TR 117 (Henry\'s Fork Trail) are camping at Dollar Lake, and when we were there recently (7/29), there were over 200 people at Dollar lake alone. Due to heavy use the USFS has placed a no camping restriction within 1000\' of both Dollar and Henry\'s Fork lakes.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r&lt;br&gt;FOR SMALL PARTIES ONLY! (1, 2 or 3 people) I would recomend continuing past Dollar lake and camping closer to Gunsight Pass. There is a small pond approx. 100m to the sw of the trail at around  11,000\'  which have a couple good spots to pitch a tent, and a larger pond / small lake at  about 11,630\' , approx. 5km ssw from the trail. These are small areas and will NOT support the large groups the BSA likes to bring in.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r&lt;br&gt;Be aware that the USFS (as they should) are enforcing the no camping closer than 200\' from trails or water sources.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r&lt;br&gt;If your really up to it, go on over Gunsight pass into the basin on the other side. Although its above tree-line there are a lot of places to camp, running water, and a lot of solitude. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r&lt;br&gt;One final note. In addition to speaking with a very frustrated USFS Ranger who was cleaing campsites,  there is a lot of trash in the area.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r&lt;br&gt;Please, if you pack in, pack it out!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r&lt;br&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td valign=\"bottom\" style=\"padding-top: 6px;\" colspan=\"2\"&gt;&lt;span style=\"font-size: 9px; color: #888;\"&gt;Posted Aug 4, 2005 2:52 pm&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;table border=\"0\" width=\"775\" class=\"messages\"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td width=\"110\" align=\"left\" valign=\"top\" style=\"padding-top: 6px;\"&gt;&lt;a name=\"121977\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a class=\"dis_user_lnk\" href=\"/users/woodstrider/17180\"&gt;woodstrider&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td valign=\"top\" style=\"padding-top: 6px;\"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Untitled Comment&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td align=\"right\" valign=\"top\" nowrap style=\"font-size: 10px;\"&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td valign=\"top\" rowspan=\"2\" align=\"left\" style=\"padding-top: 6px;\"&gt;&lt;p class=\"disc_avatar\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"/users/woodstrider/17180\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"woodstrider\" width=\"50\" height=\"50\" border=\"0\" src=\"/images/avatars/218787.gif\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=\"font-size: 9px; color: #888;\"&gt;Hasn\'t voted&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td colspan=\"2\" style=\"padding-top: 6px;\"&gt;There seems to be a summit register on Kings Peak.

It is certainly climbable any time of year however winter ascents will require skis, lots of warm clothing, a liberal dose of spare time and a love for self inflicted torture!\"&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;June climbs may be plagued by softened snowfields. And it is certainly quite unwise to call skiing a \"love of torture\". Springtime skiing typically has mild temperatures, and in good conditions, glide back from the upper basins to the trailhead may take mere couple hours and little effort, making daytrips to the peak a cherished tradition. No rain or mud, no insects or unstable boulders, no horsesh*t or noisy gangs of scouts, just what kind of a \"turture\" is it?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And of course snowshoeing is fairly popular too.&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td valign=\"bottom\" style=\"padding-top: 6px;\" colspan=\"2\"&gt;&lt;span style=\"font-size: 9px; color: #888;\"&gt;Posted Jun 4, 2014 1:45 pm&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;table border=\"0\" width=\"745\" class=\"messages\" style=\"margin-left: 30px;\"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td rowspan=\"4\" valign=\"top\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/styles/layout/reply_arrow.gif\"&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td width=\"110\" align=\"left\" valign=\"top\" style=\"padding-top: 6px;\"&gt;&lt;a name=\"483506\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a class=\"dis_user_lnk\" href=\"/users/matt-lemke/61266\"&gt;Matt Lemke&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td valign=\"top\" style=\"padding-top: 6px;\"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Re: Seasons&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td align=\"right\" valign=\"top\" nowrap style=\"font-size: 10px;\"&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td valign=\"top\" rowspan=\"2\" align=\"left\" style=\"padding-top: 6px;\"&gt;&lt;p class=\"disc_avatar\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"/users/matt-lemke/61266\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Matt Lemke\" width=\"50\" height=\"50\" border=\"0\" src=\"/images/avatars/888707.JPG\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=\"font-size: 9px; color: #888;\"&gt;Hasn\'t voted&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td colspan=\"2\" style=\"padding-top: 6px;\"&gt;I am referring to midwinter ascents with that comment...not springtime :)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It was meant as humerous and to be taken  as as joke lol. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;However I will also say that skiing is impossible ;)&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td valign=\"bottom\" style=\"padding-top: 6px;\" colspan=\"2\"&gt;&lt;span style=\"font-size: 9px; color: #888;\"&gt;Posted Jun 4, 2014 1:48 pm&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;table border=\"0\" width=\"745\" class=\"messages\" style=\"margin-left: 30px;\"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td rowspan=\"4\" valign=\"top\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/styles/layout/reply_arrow.gif\"&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td width=\"110\" align=\"left\" valign=\"top\" style=\"padding-top: 6px;\"&gt;&lt;a name=\"483645\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a class=\"dis_user_lnk\" href=\"/users/dmitry-pruss/22982\"&gt;Dmitry Pruss&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td valign=\"top\" style=\"padding-top: 6px;\"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Re: Seasons&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td align=\"right\" valign=\"top\" nowrap style=\"font-size: 10px;\"&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td valign=\"top\" rowspan=\"2\" align=\"left\" style=\"padding-top: 6px;\"&gt;&lt;p class=\"disc_avatar\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"/users/dmitry-pruss/22982\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Dmitry Pruss\" width=\"50\" height=\"50\" border=\"0\" src=\"/images/avatars/719338.JPG\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=\"font-size: 9px; color: #888;\"&gt;Voted 10/10&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td colspan=\"2\" style=\"padding-top: 6px;\"&gt;Oh, I understand that you were trying to be funny.

Portions of the Regular NW face have been affected. At this time, it is unknown how this will be addressed to allow future climbers to climb this route, one of the most significant historically in North America. In addition to this, sections above the affected areas are currently considered unstable and at risk of future rockfall. Climbers are advised to stay away from the route until stability is better ascertained. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;(&lt;a href=\"http://www.climbing.com/news/big-section-of-half-dome-route-falls-off/\"&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;br&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_2\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Overview&lt;/h2&gt;When most people think of Yosemite, an image of Half Dome\'s &lt;a href=\"/mountains/photo_link.pl?photo_id=2011&amp;amp;object_id=305&amp;amp;type=mountain&amp;amp;mountain_id=305&amp;amp;route_id=\"&gt;sheer northwest face&lt;/a&gt; towering over the valley immediately comes to mind. The inspiring view and hiker accessible \"Cables Route\" to the summit has made Half Dome one of the must do hikes for visitors coming to Yosemite National Park (YNP) from California, other parts of the United States, and indeed from around the world. Half Dome has inspired many people to take up hiking, climbing, and has even seen BASE jumpers (see Red Tape section below) and snowboarders take off from its summit. The end of 2000 saw the first two snowboard descents of Half Dome\'s east side by Jim Zellers. Unfortunately, all this attention has also made this summit extremely crowded, especially between Memorial Day and Labor Day. If you plan to hike the &lt;a href=\"/mountains/route_link.pl/route_id/1534/object_id/221\"&gt;Cables Route&lt;/a&gt; (see below) during the high season, be sure to get an early start (as well as a permit; see Red Tape below) as you can often get stuck in gridlock on the narrow cables section during the middle of the day (Ref: &lt;a href=\"/mountains/user_link.pl?user_id=1237\"&gt;BranchWhitney&lt;/a&gt;). The park doesn\'t keep official numbers of visitors, but Jim Snyder, the park\'s historian, says \"\"On Memorial Day in 1972, more than 700 people went up. It was horrendous.\" While people have been known to spend an hour on the Cables each way during the high season, climbing &lt;a href=\"/mountains/route_link.pl/route_id/79/object_id/221\"&gt;Snake Dike&lt;/a&gt; on a popular summer weekend may be even worse with reports of parties waiting 5 hours at the base of the route before getting on the rock. To get away from the crowds and enjoy fine views of the valley, try &lt;a href=\"/mountains/mountain_link.pl/mountain_id/279\"&gt;Clouds Rest&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"/mountains/mountain_link.pl/mountain_id/305\"&gt;North Dome&lt;/a&gt;. These peaks also have excellent views of Half Dome itself.  &lt;p&gt;  The majority of Half Dome ascents are made via the \"Cables Route\" via the Yosemite Valley or Happy Isles Approach. This 8.2 mile route follows the John Muir Trail (JMT) from the valley\'s Happy Isles Trailhead (4,105 feet) for 6.2 miles before branching off to the Half Dome summit trail. This route is often good at intimidating for the first time hiker due to the last 840 feet of the ascent which are assisted by &lt;a href=\"/mountains/photo_link.pl/p/photo_id__1119__object_id__2__type__user__mountain_id____route_id____user_id__\"&gt;steel cables&lt;/a&gt; attached to the dome\'s east side. Many people choose to use work gloves on the cables portion of the route to get a better grip. During the high season there is often a pile of work gloves at the base of the cables for your use, however, it may be a good idea to bring your own gloves just in case. Hikers using the JMT from the valley also have an option to take the more strenuous Mists Trail variation which gets its name from the fine spray flowing over the trail from Nevada Falls. The Mists Trail connects to the JMT on both ends so you won\'t have to worry about getting lost.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;  Warning from &lt;a href=\"/mountains/user_link.pl/user_id/305\"&gt;mconnell&lt;/a&gt; (edited): Many inexperienced hikers attempt this summit unprepared and wind up running out of water or coming down in the dark without. Basic essentials that should be considered include: enough water (2+ liters / person recommended), water filters or purification tablets, flashlights and jackets for late night descents, etc. Don\'t depend on rangers to escort you down, since they won\'t do this unless you\'re seriously injured.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;  Half Dome\'s steep NW face is home to dozens of classic rock climbs, including the Regular and Direct NW Face, all being fairly serious. There are also a number of rock climbs on its lower angle SW and South faces including the ultra popular Snake Dike route. The Regular NW Face is probably the third most popular route on the dome after the Cables Route and Snake Dike.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;table border=\"1\" cellspacing=\"0\"&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;table border=\"0\" cellspacing=\"2\" cellpading=\"1\"&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr bgcolor=\"#c0c0c0\"&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;font style=\"font-weight: bold;\"&gt;Map Name&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

You can reach Yosemite Valley via CA SR-120, CA SR-140, and CA SR-41 which enter the park at the Big Oak Flat, Arch Rock (aka El Portal), and Wawona (aka South) Entrances to the park.  &lt;p&gt;  TENAYA LAKE APPROACH (via CLOUDS REST): Drive to CA SR-120 and park at the Sunrise Trailhead just south of the lake from where you can take the trail south towards Clouds Rest. In 9.9 miles (including a summit of Clouds Rest) you will reach the JMT. Continue southwest for 0.5 miles before joining the 2 mile Half Dome summit trail. This stretch of CA SR-120 is closed during the winter. See the Road Closure Status with the link under the Mountain Conditions section.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;  TUOLUMNE MEADOWS APPROACH (via JMT): Park at Tuolumne Meadows off of CA SR-120 and head southwest on the JMT for 14.4 miles before heading northwest at the 2 mile Half Dome summit trail. This stretch of CA SR-120 is closed during the winter. See the Road Closure Status with the link under the Mountain Conditions section.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;table class=\"inline_image_thumbs\"&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=15789\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/15789.JPG\" unselectable=\"on\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=7530\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/7530.jpg\" unselectable=\"on\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=3577\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/3577.JPG\" unselectable=\"on\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=15790\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/15790.JPG\" unselectable=\"on\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=111631\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/111631.jpg\" unselectable=\"on\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_5\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Red Tape&lt;/h2&gt;PARK ENTRANCE FEE (MANDATORY): Yosemite National Park is part of the US NPS and an entrance fee is charged. The most common way to enter the park is by vehicle for a $20 entrance fee good for 7 days. Check the &lt;a href=\"http://www.nps.gov/yose/pphtml/feespermits.html\"&gt;NPS web site&lt;/a&gt; for the latest fees. As with all US National Parks, you also have the option of purchasing an annual National Parks Pass.  &lt;p&gt;  OVERNIGHT TRIP PERMIT (OPTIONAL): If you are planning an overnight trip outside established campgrounds, you will need a Wilderness Permit since YNP has a trailhead-based quota system in place. At least 40% of the permits are available on a day-of or day-before basis. See the &lt;a href=\"http://www.nps.gov/yose/wilderness/permits.htm\"&gt;YNP Wilderness Permits Page&lt;/a&gt; for more information on how to reserve these permits by the Internet, phone (209-372-0740), or mail. While the permit itself is free, if you wish to make an advance reservation, there is a non-refundable $5 per person processing fee.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;  BASE JUMPING (ILLEGAL): This activity is no longer allowed in YNP. If you get caught the penalties can include: fines up to $5000, confiscation and destruction of equipment, probation up to 3 years, as well as jail time up to 3 days. Just ask French BASE jumpers Jean-No&euml;l Itzstein and J&eacute;r&ocirc;me Ruby who experienced this first hand in 1998. Conveniently, YNP has its own court and jailhouse. This is a dangerous activity and jumpers have been killed in YNP (while running away from rangers).  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;  HALF DOME CABLES PERMIT: See below.&lt;a name=\"chapter_6\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;New and Improved: The Half Dome Via The Cables While The Cables Are Up Permit&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gone are the good ol&rsquo; days, when one could wake up, arrive at the trailhead, and set forth with 1,000 or so of ones newfound closest friends to set forth and conquer the mighty Half Dome. Likely due in no small part to the combination of the ever-increasing throngs attempting The Cables, subsequent associated environmental degradation, and not to mention a few well-publicized fatalities, the almighty National Park Service (NPS) has decreed that once the cables are &ldquo;up,&rdquo; a permit shall henceforth be required for any person desiring to hike Half Dome. It should be noted that this permit is required: 1. Only for the Cables route (other routes are unaffected), &amp;amp; 2. Only when the cables are up (check with Yosemite to see if this is the case or not). Now for the fun part of figuring out how to get the permits- yay!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;When the cables are up, you want to hike Half Dome, &amp;amp; you need a permit to do so, there are currently 3 ways by which the NPS allows you to obtain this prized commodity:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;1.Register via &lt;a href=\"http://www.recreation.gov/\"&gt;Recreation.gov&lt;/a&gt; during a preseason lottery in March (the whole month, EST if you&rsquo;re really pushing it). Through this process, 225 of these bad boys are allotted to lucky hikers per day. Notification will be sent to applicants in April telling them if they&rsquo;re winners or losers. Or, if you just can&rsquo;t take the suspense, you can also request results by checking online or calling recreation.gov.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;2.&ldquo;Daily&rdquo; lottery. Feel lucky? It&rsquo;s really more like a &lsquo;2-days before&rsquo; lottery. Too lazy or ineffectual to apply in a timely manner, months before you want to do the hike? This option is meant for you. Apply 2 days in advance (from midnight to 1 PM Pacific time). For instance, to hike on Saturday, you&rsquo;d apply on Thursday &amp;amp; receive an email notification of whether you won or lost on Thursday night. Approximately 50 permits are available daily through this system, depending on how the stars happen to line up. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;3.Backpackers. Prefer to disassociate yourself from the day-hiking riff raff, &amp;amp; want a more pristine &ldquo;wilderness&rdquo; experience? Backpack in, &amp;amp; apply for your Cables permit with the &ldquo;wilderness&rdquo; permit (i.e. separate from the day-hiking Cables permit system). There are 75 of these available daily (50 by reservation &amp;amp; 25 available 1 day in advance). Get the skinny &lt;a href=\"http://www.nps.gov/yose/planyourvisit/hdwildpermits.htm\"&gt;here.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;$$$&lt;br&gt;If applying for the daily permit, there is a (currently; it will rise soon enough) $4.50/$6.50 online/phone application fee. Those lucky enough to get the coveted permit will pay (currently) an additional $8. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;Make sense? Great! Want even more beta? Read about all the fun rules, regulations, and specificities &lt;a href=\"http://www.nps.gov/yose/planyourvisit/hdpermits.htm\"&gt;here.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_7\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;When To Climb, Ski &amp;amp; Snowboard&lt;/h2&gt;Summer time has the best weather (though most people) for hiking up the Cables Route. Rock climbers will find the spring and autumn weather more agreable. However, climbing during high season weekends can often mean long waits. On June 29, 2002 when I climbed Snake Dike for the first time, there were 22 people climbing Snake Dike and about 200 on the Cables route, spending about an hour each way on the cables. Also during 2002, Ron Karpel and Arun Mahajan spent 5 hours waiting at the base of Snake Dike before getting on the route. The reason? There were groups of 4 and 5 climbing together on the route - how crazy is that?  &lt;p&gt;  If you\'re planning on hiking up the Cables Route, you should know that the cables are usually put up in late May or June and taken down in October with the first snow storm. All this means is that the posts and the boards that make the walk-way are removed. The cables are still there, and are not at all difficult to use in their \"down\" state (if there\'s no snow/ice). In fact, during October and the spring, it\'s almost easier because there isn\'t a &lt;a href=\"http://www.summitpost.com/mountains/photo_link.pl?photo_id=14630&amp;amp;object_id=221&amp;amp;type=mountain&amp;amp;mountain_id=221&amp;amp;route_id=\"&gt;huge line of tourists&lt;/a&gt;! For even more (extreme) fun, winter snow and ice also make it possible to climb this route with an ice axe and crampons as well as enjoy challenging ski and snowboard descents.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;  &lt;font style=\"font-weight: bold;\"&gt;WINTER CONSIDERATIONS&lt;/font&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;  Depending on conditions, Half Dome can often be climbed during the winter. During low snow years such as 2003, Snake Dike will often be snow free allowing for some solitude during the climb. The cables route often has snow and an ice axe and crampons are useful for ascending this route. For the descent, you can either prussik/rap the cables route or rap Snake Dike (which can be done with a pair of 50m ropes from anywhere on the route). Conditions may warrant an ice axe and crampons for a Cables route descent if you climb Snake Dike as well.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;  &lt;a href=\"http://www.summitpost.com/mountains/user_link.pl?user_id=370\"&gt;Snwburd&lt;/a&gt; visited this peak during the winter and adds: \"the cables do little good when the snow falls. The cables are mostly buried under snow and ice and are frozen hard to the rock. You can\'t just lift them up and shake the snow off. The whole route is plastered with a veneer of snow/ice that is frightening to the average climber [...] Should you fall or the veneer give way, you\'ve got a 1,000 ft+ fall down the north face.\" Know what you\'re doing if you attempt this in winter - \'nuff said :-) Of course, this is before we climbed Snake Dike and descended the Cables route on March 8, 2003. The next task is to climb the Cables route during the winter!  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;  &lt;font style=\"font-weight: bold;\"&gt;WARNING ON SKIING &amp;amp; SNOWBOARDING&lt;/font&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;  Skiing and snowboarding from the summit is a dangerous activity with Jim Zellers making unsuccessful attempts over several years before making the first successful snowboard descent in 2000. It is not uncommon for snowslabs to slide down the 47+&deg; East Face (along the Cables Route) which would quickly sweep an unsuspecting skier / boarder down to a certain death.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;table class=\"inline_image_thumbs\"&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=8173\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/8173.jpg\" unselectable=\"on\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=8172\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/8172.jpg\" unselectable=\"on\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=18260\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/18260.jpg\" unselectable=\"on\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=54392\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/54392.jpg\" unselectable=\"on\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_8\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Camping&lt;/h2&gt;There are numerous places to camp in the park, however, during peak periods, you may not want to if you are seeking solitude. The valley can fill up with so many cars, RVs, and tents that you\'d think you were at a Boy Scout Jamboree.  &lt;p&gt;  Of the many campgrounds in Yosemite Valley, the cheapest one is Camp 4 (aka Sunnyside or climber\'s camp), a walk-in campground which is open year-round. There\'s no reservations here and everything is first-come, first-served basis so grab a spot early as they tend to go fast. Along the JMT, the Little Yosemite Campground is also popular. See the &lt;a href=\"http://www.nps.gov/yose/camping.htm\"&gt;Official YNP Campgrounds page&lt;/a&gt; for other campgrounds, permit, and reservation information. See the Red Tape section above for backcountry camping wilderness permit information.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;  Hint from &lt;a href=\"http://www.summitpost.com/mountains/user_link.pl/user_id/2\"&gt;Josh&lt;/a&gt; (edited): To save money you can always stay in the USDA National Forest Service land just outside of the park. Approximately 1.3 miles west of the Big Oak Flat Entrance on CA SR-120, there\'s a dirt road near the Yosemite Gatehouse Lodge that leads into the woods (passable by any car). Just drive down a mile or so and voila, you\'ll have a great place to camp.&lt;br&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_9\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Mountain Conditions&lt;/h2&gt;Check the &lt;a href=\"http://www.nps.gov/yose/news.htm\"&gt;Official YNP Conditions Update webpage&lt;/a&gt; or call 209-372-0200 for the current weather and road closure status. &lt;a href=\"http://forecast.weather.gov/MapClick.php?lat=37.74655746554895&amp;amp;lon=-119.53330993652344&amp;amp;site=sto&amp;amp;smap=1&amp;amp;marine=0&amp;amp;unit=0&amp;amp;lg=en\"&gt;Here&lt;/a&gt; is a link for the forecast as given by NOAA. &lt;p&gt;  Also check out the following web cams:  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;  &lt;a href=\"http://www.yosemite.org/vryos/TurtlebackCam.htm\"&gt;View from Turtleback Dome Web Cam&lt;/a&gt;: by &lt;a href=\"http://www.yosemite.org/vryos/index.htm\"&gt;Virtual Yosemite&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://www.yosemite.org/vryos/sentinelcam.htm\"&gt;View from Sentinel Dome Web Cam&lt;/a&gt;: by &lt;a href=\"http://www.yosemite.org/vryos/index.htm\"&gt;Virtual Yosemite&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;  For summer 2005 trail closure information, see the Red Tape section above.&lt;br&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_10\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Historical Timeline&lt;/h2&gt;Below is a timeline of significant events at Half Dome including a few early FA\'s.

The name South Dome was latter transferred to Half Dome, and then later still it reverted to Half Dome. South Dome was then given to what is now Mount Starr King before dropping from use altogether.   &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;  EXCERPT: The following is an excerpt from: ERWIN GUDDE, \"&lt;a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0520213165/summitpost-20\"&gt;California Place Names&lt;/a&gt;,\" 1998, ISBN: 0520213165 (Ref: &lt;a href=\"http://www.summitpost.com/mountains/user_link.pl?user_id=370\"&gt;snwburd&lt;/a&gt;):  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;  \"The name was given by the Mariposa Battalion in 1851 to the split mountain that is also known as South Dome.\"   &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;  EXCERPT: The following are two excerpts from: FRANCIS P. FARQUHAR, \"&lt;a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0520015517/summitpost-20\"&gt;History of the Sierra Nevada&lt;/a&gt;,\" 1989, ISBN: 0520015517 (Ref: &lt;a href=\"http://www.summitpost.com/mountains/user_link.pl?user_id=370\"&gt;snwburd&lt;/a&gt;):  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;  \"Name given by Bunnel and the Mariposa Battalion at the time of their visits and remaining unchanged are Mirror Lake, Clouds Rest, Little Yosemite, Yosemite Falls, Vernal Falls, Nevada Fall, Three Brothers, El Capitan, and Tenaya Lake (except for spelling).\"   &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;  \"The great Half Dome in Yosemite Valley had been pronounced by Professor Whitney in his most pontifical manner to be \'perfectly inaccessible.\' \'It never will be trodden by human foot.\' he added. He weakened a little, however, when an attempt to climb it nearly succeeded, and introduced \'perhaps\' in a new edition of his Yosemite Guide-Book. John Muir gives a lively account of this attempt. \'John Conway, a resident of the Valley, has a flock of small boys who climb smooth rocks like lizards. He sent them up the Dome with a rope, hoping they might be able to fasten it with spikes driven into fissures, and thus reach the top. They took the rope in tow and succeeded in making it fast two or three hundred feet above the point ordinarily reached, but finding the upper portion of the curve impracticable without laboriously drilling into the rock, he called down his lizards, thinking himself fortunate in effecting a safe retreat.\' Sound mountaineering on the part of Mr. Conway!   &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;  It remained for another resident of the Valley, George C. Anderson, whom Muir was happy to acknowledge as a fellow Scot, to complete the climb and be the first to set foot upon the summit of Half Dome. \'Anderson began with Conway\'s old rope,\' says Muir, \'and resolutely drilled for the next above. Occasionally some irregularity in the curve or slight foothold would enable him to climb fifteen or twenty feet independently of the rope, which he would pass and begin drilling again, the whole thing accomplished in a few days.\' Muir himself hastened to be among the first to follow. \'Our first winter storm had bloomed,\' he writes, \'and all the mountains were mantled with fresh snow. I was therefore a little apprehensive of danger from the slipperiness of the rock, Anderson refusing to believe that anyone could climb his rope in the condition it was then in.\' But Muir went up, alone, and \'gained the top without the slightest difficulty.\' In characteristic fashion he goes on to describe the view and particularly the botany. Spiraea and Pentstemon were there, and several species of grasses and sedges. There were three species of pines, \'repressed and storm beaten.\' He never gets around to telling us how he got down, but it may be presumed that he did not spend the night there.   &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;  Others soon followed, including \'four English gentlemen, then sojourning in the Valley. A day or two afterwards, Miss S. L. Dutcher, of San Francisco, with the courage of a heroine, accomplished it, and was the first lady that ever stood upon it.\' There were other early ascents of Half Dome, and there is one that deserves special mention, for it introduces an advance upon Clarence King\'s riata method. During the winter of 1883-1884 ice and snow had carried away most of Anderson\'s rope and some of his eyebolts. \'Just after sunset, one evening of the ensuing summer,\' writes Hutchings, \'every resident of the Valley, familiar with the fact of the ropes removal, was startled by the sight of a blazing fire upon the crest of the Dome.\' It turned out that two young men had made the perilous climb. One of them, Alden Sampson of New York, a few days later gave Hutchings a vivid account of their experiences; the other Phimister Proctor, of Colorado, writing sixty years afterwards, added some interesting details. To read the whole story leaves one limp with vicarious fatigue, as may be conceived from the following abridgement: \'I made the climb barefoot,\' says Proctor. \'Sampson had nailed boots. I was a pretty fair hand with a lariat, so, tying a loop on a lash rope, I made a throw. After several false pitches I got the range. As we proceeded we found that some of the pins had been bent and were difficult to rope. Often my loop would roll over a ring twenty times before I caught it. Several of the pins pulled out when I put my weight on the rope. When I reached a pin I would climb up on it, leaning against the wall of the mountain, and hook my big toe over the pin.\' Now let Sampson take up the tale: \'After a while we came to a clean stretch of a hundred feet where every pin had been carried away; yet at this point a difficult corner of the ledge had to be turned. In the hardest place of all, a little bunch of dwarf Spiraea, six or eight inches high, which was growing in a crevice, gave me friendly assistance.\' At the end of the first day they had made but half the distance. The second day was even more perilous than the first, but they made the top at last and just at sunset built the fire that was seen from below. \'Relunctantly we left,\' writes Proctor, \'slid down the cable and reached safety just at dark.\' \"&lt;br&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_12\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;External Links&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://www.outsidemag.com/magazine/200011/200011disp10.html\"&gt;Jim Zellers\' First Snowboard Descent of Half Dome&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;Outside Online\'s article and photo of this amazing feat.

When viewed from the north or northeast, Wilson Peak does indeed strike a mighty profile; similar actually, to that of Mt. Sneffels in that [each] very singular mountain almost lords over their respective ridgeline by what seems like thousands of feet. &lt;br&gt;Wilson Peak is a frightfully beautiful mountain. The aspen forests below set the wilderness on fire come autumn. Snow often lingers well into summer inside the more deeply etched couloirs and runnels and the grey and white rock that make up the shifting alpine, throws the mountain into a splendid relief against the blue and violet sky of dusk. &lt;br&gt;The whole concept of what exactly constitutes the &ldquo;Colorado Rocky Mountain High&rdquo; is writ all over Wilson Peak. &lt;br&gt;&lt;noformat&gt;&lt;img src=\"http://www.felixfineart.com/Tracy%20gallery/images/Wilson%20Peak.jpg\" alt=\"Oil Painting by Tracy Felix\" align=\"right\" border=\"0\" height=\"300\" width=\"412\"&gt;&lt;/noformat&gt;&lt;br&gt;This mountain, if the Maroon Bells didn&rsquo;t feel up to it, could come to represent what Colorado is. And the fact that it does take some effort to travel to this part of the state also coincides in that Colorado has so much more than what tourists only see within the comfy confines of the Metro Denver area. Wilson Peak is the reason why some of us leave the pavement and trade our loafers for hiking boots. It&rsquo;s no wonder that Adolf Coors choose this mountain to represent his beer in 1873. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;At 14,017, Wilson Peak is certainly not the highest Fourteener nor is it the most prominent. It is the highest point in San Miguel County and the 48th highest Fourteener. Wilson Peak makes up â…“ of the trifecta commonly known as &lsquo;The Wilsons&rsquo;; the other two peaks being El Diente and Mt. Wilson. To some degree, a forth mountain known as Gladstone Peak is typically included in this massif. Gladstone Peak is a centennial (top-100 highest). &lt;br&gt;Having two mountains to such proximity to each other, Wilson Peak is only 1.5 miles north of Mt. Wilson, there&rsquo;s usually some confusion in keeping the two separate. However, if one commits to memory that Wilson Peak is featured by Coors (peak=beer, 4 syllables), one might do ok in remembering. Another feature to point out in keeping these two mountains separate is that Wilson Peak is the EASIEST of these three to climb, Mt. Wilson being the hardest. Fact, many people climb Wilson Peak first in preparation for the other two. &lt;br&gt;Wilson Peak was named for a fellow by the name of A.D. Wilson who was in 1874, the chief topographer/cartographer on the famous Hayden Surveys. Wilson Peak lies within the Lizard Head Wilderness and the San Juan National Forest and the Uncompaghre National Forest Area. The Lizard Head Wilderness Area is approximately 41,193 acres (16,670ha) in size and is widely known throughout Colorado for the aspens. &lt;br&gt;Wilson Peak may be one of the lowest Fourteener&rsquo;s in the state but it still has a decent amount of prominence, about 877&rsquo;. It is located within the &lt;a href=\"http://www.listsofjohn.com/Quads/Quads.php?q=11591\"&gt;Mt. Wilson Quadrangle&lt;/a&gt; and consequently, Mt. Wilson is its&rsquo; proximate parent.       &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;center&gt;Norwood Ranger District&lt;br&gt;Uncompaghre National Forest&lt;br&gt;1150 Forest Street&lt;br&gt;Norwood, Colorado 81423&lt;br&gt;970.327.4261&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;u&gt;USGS Maps&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/b&gt;: Mt.

The wilderness act when signed into law by President Lyndon B. Johnson on September 3rd, 1964, legally defined what exactly constitutes a wilderness area. This act protected at its&rsquo; onset, some 9.1 million acres&hellip;Lizard Head Wilderness is but a pence in a huge coffer of coin. There are four distinct Federal agencies that have, to varying degrees, jurisdiction over the existing wilderness areas and the new ones waiting to be established. These agencies are in order of scope: National Park Service, U.S. Forest Service, U.S. Fish and Game and the BLM.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Since the laws governing wilderness areas are typically more strict and cumbersome than National Forest or BLM Lands, the following regulations pertain to climbing, camping, hiking and simple visits specific to Lizard Head:&lt;br&gt;1.)	Motorized equipment is not allowed.&lt;br&gt;2.)	In 1986, regulators expanded the definition of &lsquo;motorized&rsquo; to include mountain bikes. &lt;br&gt;3.)	Hang Gliders, carts or any vehicle with wheels are not allowed.&lt;br&gt;4.)	Groups can be no more than 15 people in size, 25 with livestock.&lt;br&gt;5.)	It is prohibited to build a fire within 100ft. of Navajo Lake, near any source of water or above tree line. &lt;br&gt;6.)	All domesticated pets must be in control whether that means via voice command or leash.&lt;br&gt;7.)	It likewise, is prohibited to camp within 100ft of Navajo Lake or any water source.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And of course, as a compliment to future campers and hikers, please be considerate and remember to practice &lt;a href=\"http://www.lnt.org/\"&gt;&ldquo;Leave No Trace&rdquo;&lt;/a&gt; ethics while backcountry. &lt;br&gt;Other than that, all the red tape is pretty much non-existent!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;To access Wilson Peak (or the other 14ers) legally using the Silver Pick Trailhead thus, avoiding the private property owned by Rusty Nichols, the new trailhead is located about 3.1 miles up Elk Creek Road. &lt;br&gt;This is near where the old Wilson Mesa Trailhead is directly on Silver Pick Road. Once one leaves the trailhead (10,383ft), &lt;i&gt;The Rock of Ages Trail&lt;/i&gt; (&lt;b&gt;#429&lt;/b&gt;) will start out at a moderate incline before switch-backing frequently up and out of Elk Creek Drainage. The trail crests the ridge and drops into Silver Pick Basin high up on the far western edge ABOVE the private property. &lt;br&gt;It is well at the head of Silver Pick Basin that the new spur segment connects with the old traditional route. This is the shortest approach to access Wilson Peak as it comes in at around 3.8 miles RT from the trailhead to the Rock of Ages Saddle (~13,335ft).&lt;br&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_3\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Getting There&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;noformat&gt;&lt;table align=\"left\" border=\"7\"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://www.summitpost.org/wilson-peak-as-seen-from/131159/c-150382\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"http://images.summitpost.org/original/131159.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr align=\"left\" valign=\"top\"&gt;&lt;td colspan=\"3\"&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;center&gt;Wilson Peak from the north.&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/noformat&gt; Wilson Peak has two main approaches plus a minor third. The first is from the highly publicized, Rock of Ages (Silver Prick). The second main approach is via Sunshine Mesa (Bilk Basin). A longer but in my opinion, prettier approach is from Woods Lake located to the west. There are other approaches of course but generally speaking, these are farther and predominantly used for El Diente and Mt. Wilson. In terms of proximity and ease of access, Rock of Ages, Sunshine Mesa and Woods Lake will be detailed.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_4\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;ROCK OF AGES&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;br&gt;Also known as the Silver Pick approach stemming from the mine located at the head of Fall River Creek, the Silver Pick Mine, this is the most efficient and direct route to gain the summit of Wilson Peak. It is class 2 the entire way to the Rock of Ages Saddle (13,000ft) and thanks to some very hard and ongoing work by the CFI in surmounting the obstacles that local land owner, Rusty Nichols made difficult for the climbing community, this approach can be considered a viable avenue again with some minor detours along the way including an entirely new trailhead (opened in August of 2011). This approach is roughly 3.75 miles roundtrip to the saddle. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The new approach directions as listed below are taken from 14ers.com with Bill Middlebrooks&rsquo;s permission. For a more detailed description that includes associated pictures, please visit &lt;a href=\"http://www.14ers.com/routemain.php?route=silv0&amp;amp;peak=Mt.+Wilson%2C+Wilson+Peak%2C+and+El+Diente+Peak\"&gt;Bill&rsquo;s page (14ers.com)&lt;/a&gt; on this subject. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;&ldquo;From Ridgway, leave U.S. 550 and take Colorado 62 towards Telluride. Drive over Dallas Divide and down to the town of Placerville. Turn left onto Colorado 145. Drive 6.5 miles and turn right on the Silver Pick road. It is 6.8 miles from here to the trailhead. From the start of the road, drive 3.1 miles to an intersection. The sign says \"Silver Pick Basin - 5\". Stay left. After another 0.7 mile, there is a confusing intersection. Do not continue on the road that goes straight. Turn right a bit to see the road that you want. Do not take the road that takes a hard right (it has a Private Property sign). Drive into the National Forest after another 2.2 miles (6.0 miles since you left Colorado 145). After another 0.1 mile, turn right onto FR 645 and continue approx. 2.25 miles (there are some possible campsites along the way) to the new Rock of Ages trailhead near 10,350&rsquo;.&lt;br&gt;From the new Rock of Ages trailhead, hike south and then southeast on the Rock of Ages (#429) trail to enter Silver Pick Basin near 11,300\'. Continue southeast up into the basin. Continue on the road as it climbs south into the basin.&lt;br&gt;Near 11,500\', cables (on the ground) from an old ariel tramway become evident. The road parallels the cables for a while and briefly turns right (west) near 11,800\'. The road soon leads back to the center of the basin. Stay on the road as it climbs east and then south to the top of a small hill with the remains of a rock house. From the rock house, you will need to do some brief route finding. Look directly south up on the steep slope to see the remnants of the Silver Pick mine. Just to the left of the mine, locate a dirt \"trail\" that leads up to the mine. From the rock house, walk across and then up some talus. There\'s not a great trail here, just continue south up talus until you spot the best way to reach the base of the slope. Locate the loose trail and climb approximately 450\' to the left side of the mine. Near the mine, find a better trail that heads left (southeast). Follow the trail across the steep slope to reach the \"Rock of Ages\" saddle near 13,000\'.&rdquo;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_5\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;SUNSHINE MESA/BILK BASIN&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;br&gt;Leaving the town of Telluride, head west on Co 145 for about 2.5-2.6 miles. They&rsquo;ll be a sign for South Fork Road on the left side (south) and a tourist outdoors camp called Camp Ilium. Head down and cross over the San Miguel River on a small wooden bridge after 0.2 mile. Simply follow the road as it courses south. After 2.0 miles, look for the Sunshine Mesa Road turnoff (FR 623). Turn right (west). The road will climb gradually for roughly 7.6 miles with a couple of descents thrown in. Sunshine Mesa Road will dead-end at the trailhead at mile 7.7. This trailhead is at 9,800ft. This approach accesses Wilson Peak&rsquo;s east flanks and is not maintained in winter. &lt;br&gt;For a description of the entire trail from the &lt;b&gt;Bilk Creek trailhead&lt;/b&gt;, go &lt;a href=\"http://gorp.away.com/gorp/resource/us_national_forest/co/unc_trails/lizardhd.htm\"&gt;here.&lt;/a&gt;	&lt;br&gt;This trailhead can also be used to climb Gladstone Peak.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_6\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;WOODS LAKE&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;br&gt;From the junction of Co 145 and Co 62, drive east for 2.7-2.8 miles on Co 145 passing through Placerville. Look for a signed road on the right side saying Fall Creek Road (57-F Road). This will be your exit. Turn south crossing the San Miguel River at 0.1 mile and set your odometer. Continue driving south and southwest for roughly 4.0 miles. At mile 4.0, turn right and continue to drive straight ignoring the side roads. Pass a small intersection at mile 6.0 and again at 7.8. At roughly 9.0 miles, there will be a forest service sign indicating Woods Lake Campground. Pull into the campground and look for the separate area used for trailhead parking (it&rsquo;s quite ample). This trailhead starts at 9,352ft and provides access to El Diente, Wilson Peak and Mt. Wilson via Navajo Lake/Basin. The trail (#406) winds around Woods Lake within a quarter-mile or so of the trailhead then zigzags across a few small streams in its first 3 miles through the thick forest. The climbing initially is steep and somewhat steady until the Woods Lake Trail meets the Elk Creek Trail in an open hillside just above treeline &lt;i&gt;(make sure you have your camera!)&lt;/i&gt;. The flies and mosquitos on this very green and tranquil approach can be horrendous in late summer but the view of El Diente as one finally crosses the saddle that descends into Navajo Basin is intoxicating!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_7\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;KILPACKER TRAILHEAD&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;br&gt;Sitting at a respectable 10,060ft, Kilpacker is the trailhead of choice for most El Diente ventures and ascents because of its relative proximity to the mountain. Kilpacker provides access to the southern routes for El Diente and the southwestern slope for Mt. Wilson. Convenience is high for this portal.&lt;br&gt;Travel south from Lizard Head Pass on Co. 145 for roughly 5.5 miles. Turn right (west) onto FR 535 (Dunton Road). The drive from the trailhead from this point can be a bit convoluted but persist!&lt;br&gt;The dirt road will slowly climb in a northwestern direction. There will be a bit of a &lsquo;rough intersection&rsquo; at mile 4.2. Keep driving straight through this. At 5.0 miles, turn right onto FR 207. The trailhead is only another 0.3 miles. Dunton Road is NOT plowed or maintained in winter but the frequent snowmobilers will make life easier for a short while! Parking can be tight.&lt;br&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_8\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Route Options&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;noformat&gt;&lt;img src=\"http://i167.photobucket.com/albums/u135/doumall/Wilsons%20Ski/for%20TR/WilsonPeakSki2.jpg\" alt=\"Jordan White skiing some sick terrain off Wilson Peak!\" align=\"left\" border=\"0\" height=\"400\" width=\"532\"&gt;&lt;/noformat&gt; &lt;b&gt;There are a few different options available to climb Wilson Peak&lt;/b&gt;. The Southwest Ridge is the most common and standard route on this peak. It can be accessed from either Rock of Ages, Navajo Lake or Bilk Basin. &lt;br&gt;A couple other common options are the Northwest Face and the Northwest Ridge. As a ski descent, Wilson Peak is an advanced to extreme ski trip. Most folks ski the Northface Face but the Southeast Face can also be skied. &lt;br&gt;Check out the links on the left as to these routes. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;14ers.com has some killer write-up\'s on these routes. Very well written, tons of helpful pictures and beta.

Wilson and El Diente can all be day-tripped from every trailhead, I&rsquo;ll explain a little about the most centered/convenient or oft-used areas for camping.&lt;br&gt;Probably hands down the one area most people use to camp for these three peaks is Navajo Lake located at 11,120ft. This pristine lake located just below treeline is situated 0.3 west of El Diente and 0.45 miles west of Mt. Wilson. Wilson Peak (and the Rock of Ages saddle) is roughly 0.7 miles from Navajo Lake. &lt;br&gt;There are ample sites available to camp at around the lake with additional sites located 0.1 mile &lsquo;up-valley&rsquo; from the lake on its&rsquo; northern fringe. Most of the sites are located across the outlet where the trail first meets Navajo Lake on its western end. Just look for and utilize existing fire rings to avoid degradation of the forest since this is a wildly popular destination in summer. A few camping sites don&rsquo;t allow fires but these, the last time I was up there were signed as such. Just remember to practice ethical camping habits so future campers can equally enjoy this beautiful and sheltered basin.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Camping of course is also an option at Woods Lake Campground. Hiking and climbing these Fourteener&rsquo;s in a day from Woods Lake will be a bit of a stretch but is quite doable as a long day. &lt;br&gt;The campground, located 0.4 miles from Woods Lake and 0.75 miles from Lizard Head Wilderness is situated in multiple thick stands of Aspen.  It is comprised of three loops, one of which is designed for horses.  This horse loop has a corral with five paddocks and a watering trough.  A large parking lot is available for parking horse trailers.  The campground is an excellent base camp for hikers and horses to access Lizard Head Wilderness. There are incredible views looking south from the campground of mountains in Lizard Head Wilderness.  And, of course, the \"quaking\" leaves and majestic fall colors from the Aspen, add to the draw of this campground.&lt;br&gt;The campground is $14.00 per day with a 2 week maximum stay. This is a seasonal campground opening its gates around late May and closing mid-September. Tables and grilles are available, vault toilets and fishing is allowed (Cutthroat and Rainbow).  There are four water spigots but no public phone or flush toilets. This is a first come- first serve campground. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There is also car-camping at the Kilpacker Trailhead but this is limited to the spaces available. I&rsquo;ve yet to ever run into a problem (twice) doing this. &lt;br&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_10\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Mountain Conditions&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p align=\"center\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"http://www.summitpost.org/images/original/129177.jpg\" border=\"12\"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p align=\"center\"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Wilson Peak shines in its winter coat on a glorious fall day in the San Juan Mountains&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Digital photo by Todd Caudle&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p align=\"left\"&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://www.14ers.com/php14ers/weather.php?ltype=1#\"&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;font color=\"blue\"&gt;&lt;font size=\"4\"&gt;7-day outlook&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;b&gt;Temperature Conversions&lt;/b&gt;:&lt;br&gt;&lt;form name=\"inputForm\"&gt;&lt;script language=\"JavaScript\" src=\"http://www.metric-conversions.org/temperature/fahrenheit-to-celsius.js\"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;table width=\"53%\" border=\"1\" bordercolor=\"#000000\"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td colspan=\"2\"&gt;&lt;font size=\"-2\" face=\"Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Convert &deg;F to &deg;C&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td width=\"72%\"&gt;&lt;table width=\"100%%\" border=\"0\"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td width=\"56%\"&gt;&lt;font size=\"-2\" face=\"Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif\"&gt;Enter &deg;F&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td width=\"44%\"&gt;&lt;font size=\"-2\"&gt;&lt;input name=\"arguement\" type=\"text\" id=\"arguement\" size=\"10\" maxlength=\"10\"&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td width=\"28%\"&gt;&lt;input type=\"button\" name=\"Button\" value=\"convert\" onclick=\"javascript:convert()\"&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td colspan=\"2\"&gt;&lt;table width=\"100%%\" border=\"0\"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td width=\"66%\"&gt;&lt;font size=\"-2\" face=\"Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif\"&gt;Value in &deg;C&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td width=\"34%\"&gt;&lt;font size=\"-2\"&gt; &lt;/font&gt;&lt;font size=\"-2\" face=\"Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif\"&gt;&lt;input name=\"result\" type=\"text\" id=\"result\" size=\"10\" maxlength=\"0\"&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td colspan=\"2\"&gt;&lt;div align=\"center\"&gt;&lt;font size=\"-2\" face=\"Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://www.metric-conversions.org\"&gt;provided by metric conversions&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/form&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;span style=\"display:block !important; width: 488px; text-align: center; font-family: sans-serif; font-size: 12px;\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://www.wunderground.com/cgi-bin/findweather/getForecast?query=Placerville,%20CO\" title=\"Placerville, CO Weather Forecast\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"http://weathersticker.wunderground.com/weathersticker/bigwx_cond/language/english/US/CO/Placerville.gif\" alt=\"Find more about Weather in Placerville, CO\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://www.wunderground.com\" title=\"Get latest Weather Forecast updates\" style=\"font-family: sans-serif; font-size: 12px;\"&gt;Click for weather forecast&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_11\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Mining&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;font size=\"3\"&gt;&ldquo;Colorado men are we. From the peaks gigantic,&lt;br&gt;From the great Sierra&rsquo;s and the plateau&rsquo;s,From the mine and from the gully, from&lt;br&gt;The hunting trail we come.&lt;br&gt;Pioneers! O Pioneers!&rdquo;&lt;br&gt;&lt;font color=\"brown\"&gt;-Walt Whitman&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There are multiple words instantly associated with Colorado: Outdoors, skiing, John Denver, climbing, hunting, Aspen and Vail, Pikes Peak and of course, mining. &lt;br&gt;Colorado owes its expansion and pioneering envelopment to the miners and fortune-seekers that trekked into the unknown valleys and on high looking for the future. The industry of mining opened up Colorado to a far larger extent than other places than say, California, Nevada or even Alaska. &lt;br&gt;&lt;noformat&gt;&lt;img src=\"http://www.miningartifacts.org/Colorado_Fuel___Iron_Co._Sunshine__Mine_-_Glenwwod_Springs__CO_1.jpg\" alt=\"Smuggler Mine near Telluride\" align=\"left\" border=\"0\" height=\"370\" width=\"512\"&gt;&lt;/noformat&gt;	&lt;br&gt;There are over 300+ ghost and mining towns sprinkled over the Rockies and another ~212 give or take, over the eastern plains. One could probably make the case that mining is a &ldquo;gateway industry&rdquo; of sorts in that the digging, blood, whisky and tears of failed and half-realized dreams paved the way for other industries such as ranching (cattle &amp;amp; sheep), general commerce, the Railroad and homesteading. Through this progression, the unknowns of Colorado became, known. &lt;br&gt;Other than the staple ores of gold and silver, other minerals were mined throughout Colorado&rsquo;s history: nickel, lead, molybdenum, uranium, iron, tellurium and marble to name a few. However, it was gold and silver and that eventually uplifted some on the broken backs of others. &lt;br&gt;Many towns and cities like: Silverton, Silverplume, Silver Dale and Argentine took their name from the element that was by the late 1860&rsquo;s, in short supply. Roughly ten years later around 1870, gold was starting to come into its own and in 1874, the San Juan Mountains experienced a sizeable gold rush that lasted well neigh of 30 years. Most mining towns saw their birth between 1858 and 1902. Most however, died quietly and faded back into the mountain sides like strewn Aspen leaves. The only life remaining in these lonely places is the barks of curious marmots or the occasional throttle of an ATV or Jeep. Nature is slowly taking back what was always rightfully hers. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Rising costs, weather, declining profits from supply and demand and two World Wars effectively ended Colorado&rsquo;s mining era. The skeletons of these orphaned dreams and lost passions however, still remain. Of all the mountain ranges and sub-ranges in Colorado that supported mining (keep in mind, not all areas are pocked and torn from mining), the San Juan Mountains were unequivocally of the largest. &lt;br&gt;Below is just a small sample of what lies within the vicinity of the Wilson Peak, Mt. Wilson and El Diente.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;SAWPIT&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;A Blacksmith was the driving reason why Sawpit came into existence. The &lsquo;smithie&rsquo;, James Blake, found relatively high-grade ore in the placer and further up on the mountainside while on a scouting trip in 1895. Once a mine was dug and validated, he named him stake the &ldquo;Champion Belle&rdquo;. The first three loads of ore alone netted him almost $1,800 to say nothing of the following 35 loads. The floodgates opened once word got out and other would-be prospectors permeated the valley. By 1896, another major mine was opened within shooting distance of the Belle&hellip;the Commercial Mine. Saw Pit became incorporated.  &lt;br&gt;I&rsquo;ve read how Saw Pit was named for a nearby creek but I&rsquo;ve also read how the name was derived from a rather &lsquo;larger than usual&rsquo; saw pit on site. Saw Pits were used by the miners to basically half felled trees and lumber. One miner would hold one end of a large saw atop the pit while the other would jump down into the hole and grasp the other end and hope he didn&rsquo;t get crushed. The fortune days of Saw Pit last until roughly 1905 before things started to dwindle. Now, all that&rsquo;s left is some rag-tag buildings and perhaps the odd, covered foundation. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;PLACERVILLE&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Placerville was named for the obvious placer gold found here. Even after the gold dwindled and disappeared from the creek, the small town kept battling for life through the years, holding onto its name; fact, a small contingent of people still live here.&lt;br&gt;A prospecting party in 1876 from Del Norte led by Colonel S.H. Baker is generally credited with finding gold here. Come 1877, the rudimentary beginnings of a mining camp began to take hold. But Placerville&rsquo;s start wasn&rsquo;t as cut and dry as most other mining towns. If anything, the growth and movement of Placerville illustrated how flexible the miners could be gold, whisky and supplies were on the table. &lt;br&gt;Even though some cabins and various foundations were either already built or laid down, the progenitor of the saloon and general store didn&rsquo;t like the original location. There was a better spot about 1.5 miles further up-valley that this gentleman liked better. So he tore what infrastructure he had down and moved his businesses up-valley. Ordinarily, this wouldn&rsquo;t have been a problem since more than one individual usually built a saloon or gaming hall. However, this was Placerville&rsquo;s ONLY saloon and General Store. So since going without supplies or libations simply wasn&rsquo;t an option, the miners pulled up their stakes and relocated 1.5 miles further up-valley to be in the vicinity of the saloon and commerce. &lt;br&gt;&lt;noformat&gt;&lt;img src=\"http://www.miningartifacts.org/8_Liberty_Bell_Mine_-_Telluride__CO.jpg\" alt=\"Liberty Bell Mine\" align=\"left\" border=\"0\" height=\"370\" width=\"512\"&gt;&lt;/noformat&gt;&lt;br&gt;Placerville grew slowly but steadily throughout the late 1800&rsquo;s. Another odd twist is that Placerville&rsquo;s &lsquo;growth spurt&rsquo; didn&rsquo;t come for nearly another 10-12 years and it wasn&rsquo;t gold that spurned the influx but rather, ranching. &lt;br&gt;Cattlemen came first seeing the potential in the area&rsquo;s fields, meadows and high plateau&rsquo;s. A few years later, the real problems began&hellip;sheep herders came to town. The cattlemen hated the sheepherders. There were about 3-4 years in the early 1900&rsquo;s where the violence between these two groups threatened to override the town. Fighting became a daily occurrence over the pastures. Eventually, the two learned to live with one another. &lt;br&gt;In 1904, a massive flood nearly wiped out the entire town (probably due to spring snowmelt). To give you a small comparison, this same year, 1904, F.O. Stanley and his wife (Flora) had just moved to the small town of Estes Park for the summer. The Stanley Hotel would come after another five years.  &lt;br&gt;A fire nearly destroyed much of Placerville in 1919 but resiliency took over and the town was rebuilt. Due to the large parcels of private land that surround Placerville now, expansion is guaranteed to never happen. The town will never grow beyond its current borders. There are a few stragglers whom still call Placerville home and slightly more ramshackle buildings and ghosts of buildings that dot the valley.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;FALL CREEK&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Also referred to as Seymore and Silver Pick, during the 1890&rsquo;s, Seymore was a busy mining camp located on Fall Creek. It served as the main hub for all the ore coming out of the Silver Pick Mine further up Fall Creek near Wilson Peak. It supported multiple buildings including a post office, a few saloons, general mercantile and even a small hotel. For whatever reason in 1894, the post office was actually moved TO the Silver Pick Mine. Two years later, it was relocated to the town of Saw Pit. &lt;br&gt;The officially changed its name to Fall Creek in 1922.  The name, &lsquo;Fall Creek&rsquo; is simply a general term for a river or creek that seems to have an overabundance of waterfalls. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;SAN MIGUEL&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Located a few miles down-valley from Telluride, San Miguel (Spanish for Saint Michael) rivaled Telluride for a short spell in terms of rowdiness, population and popularity. The town had a very decent gold and silver mine located nearby and cattle were a daily aggravation that just had to be tolerated. Telluride never really suffered this problem at least, not to the extent that the lower altitude towns did. What San Miguel did have going for it were excellent foundations. The town was laid down very smartly and conservatively. Not too many trees were cut down nor was the creek diverted.  However, in the end, Telluride won out. San Miguel was a bit too much on the quieter side and placid.&lt;br&gt;&lt;noformat&gt;&lt;img src=\"http://www.miningartifacts.org/5_Creede__CO_Miners.jpg\" alt=\"Group Photo. Unnamed Location\" align=\"right\" border=\"0\" height=\"270\" width=\"412\"&gt;&lt;/noformat&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;OMEGA&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;A one-time and short lived settlement located near Placerville but its exact location is sketchy at best. The town&rsquo;s odd name (for a mining camp) came from some of the settlers opinions that &ldquo;this was it&rdquo;. &lt;br&gt;Being the last letter in the Greek alphabet, the connotations that Omega was the last town for gold were apparent. It lasted roughly 10 years.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;VANADIUM&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Located up-valley from the Belle Champion Mine, Placerville and Fall Creek, Vanadium was little more than a rag-tag, rough mining camp. The town grew around a huge mill operated by the U.S. Vanadium Corporation. Like Omega, it too experienced a tragically short lifespan but buildings still exist including the old post office. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I&rsquo;ve seen other town names mentioned in some of my readings like: &lt;b&gt;Hangtown&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;Dry Diggings&lt;/b&gt; but I have yet to actually come across any information on these &lsquo;towns&rsquo;. This is a common theme in the mining years throughout Colorado. Towns will literally spring up overnight only to disappear after 6 months to a year, give or take. &lt;br&gt;Usually the gold will play out, the claim(s) end up proving unfruitful, weather or snow will force people out or distances needed to travel to attain supplies is too great. In such instances, I&rsquo;m inclined to think that these homesteaders/miners set up nothing more than small encampments.&lt;a name=\"chapter_12\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The Rusty Nichols Debacle...&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;noformat&gt;&lt;p align=\"center\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"http://wideeyedimages.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/Wilson-Detail1.jpg\" width=\"650\" height=\"370\"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p align=\"center\"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/noformat&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_13\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;b&gt;Conflict and Resolution at Wilson Peak&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;Wilson Peak is one of Colorado\'s famed \"Fourteener&rsquo;s\"&mdash; the 54 peaks in the state that top 14,000 feet. In a state where mountain climbing is approached with almost religious fervor, many climbers make it a life\'s goal to summit all of the Fourteener&rsquo;s. \"They have a huge mountain feel,\" says Weihenmayer, who has climbed nearly 30 of them himself.&lt;br&gt;Even in such lofty company, Wilson Peak seems special. Its thrusting summit is one of the best-known Colorado mountain images, used frequently in posters and advertisements, most notably for Coors beer. In recent years, however, the most accessible trail up Wilson Peak has been mostly off-limits to climbers. While most of the mountain lies within the Lizard Head Wilderness of the Uncompahgre National Forest, the summit trail traverses historic mining claims that remained private when the national forest was created early in the last century. As the number of climbers has increased in recent years, tensions have built between them and the landowner, Rusty Nichols. At first, Nichols began requiring mountaineers to sign a liability waiver and pay $100 to cross his land. Then, in 2007, he closed the trail entirely.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Nichols hoped to resolve the access issue by persuading the U.S. Forest Service to buy the land, or take it in exchange for valuable parcels nearby, but negotiations went nowhere. To break the impasse, TPL stepped in to option the property and facilitate an agreement that would reestablish climbing access to the peak. On hearing of this opportunity, Eric Weihenmayer offered to lead a climb that would call attention to TPL\'s efforts to protect access not only to Wilson Peak, but also to other Colorado Fourteener&rsquo;s and recreation sites.&lt;br&gt;In Colorado, one sign of this demand is the number of climbers seeking out 14,000-foot peaks. About 60,000 people climbed a Fourteener in 1984, according to the Colorado Fourteener&rsquo;s Initiative, a nonprofit that works to preserve the natural integrity of these iconic peaks. By 2004 the number had swelled to half a million annually, and the group predicts there will be one million Fourteener climbs by 2011. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\"The biggest problem with the increasing numbers is that Colorado\'s trails are not designed to meet that demand,\" says James Ashby, interim executive director of the Fourteener&rsquo;s Initiative. Heavily used routes become widened, incised, and braided. Sometimes hikers strike out across fragile tundra and alpine vegetation, which can take decades and even centuries to recover.&lt;br&gt;In the face of this demand, groups like the Colorado Fourteener&rsquo;s Initiative have helped to reroute or rebuild worn-down trails. The Forest Service also works to mitigate the impact of hikers on sensitive alpine environments. But one of the biggest management issues arising from increased visitation is maintaining any kind of access, especially where trails cross private land.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Trailheads, climbing approaches, or in a few instances the summits of six Colorado Fourteener&rsquo;s are located on privately owned mining claims. To encourage economic development in the West, 19th-century mining laws made it easy to \"patent\" a claim for a few dollars. And while most small, high-country claims are no longer worked for minerals, many of them could be developed into second-home or cabin sites, blocking access to areas that help support Colorado\'s $10 billion outdoor recreation economy.&lt;br&gt;Historically, Fourteener hikers and climbers have trespassed across private mining claims&mdash;trespasses that were largely ignored when visitor numbers were low. But the recent tidal wave of peak-baggers has caused some landowners, like Rusty Nichols, to worry about vandalism and theft&mdash;and about liability in an increasingly litigious society. At several Fourteeners, tensions between hikers and landowners gradually built, coming to a head in 2005 when a handful of landowners in the Mosquito Range, southwest of Denver, announced they were shutting off access to their peaks. Then, in 2007, Rusty Nichols closed the popular Wilson Peak trail.&lt;br&gt;Nichols, a Texas real estate developer, bought his first mining claims beneath Wilson Peak in 1978, as a getaway location. The parcels included a miner\'s cabin from the turn of the 20th century, when as many as 500 gold miners worked in the Silver Pick Basin, on the northwest side of the mountain. \"I was looking for privacy and a place I could take my kids camping,\" Nichols says.&lt;br&gt;He eventually bought up several other patented claims, initially to buffer his property from other potential mining operations. But he also hired a geologist to assess the land\'s mineral value and learned that remaining gold veins might make mining worthwhile. \"Mining was always an option, and a lucrative one,\" Nichols adds.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In the years following Nichols\'s land purchases, Telluride\'s growing reputation as a recreation destination attracted skiers, hikers, climbers, and other outdoor enthusiasts. Demand for second homes fed a steep rise in real estate prices.&lt;br&gt;\"Early on, I would go up there with my sons for a week at a time and maybe see three or four people,\" Nichols says. But by the late 1980s, he estimates, more than 100 people a week were coming through his land during the summer. That\'s also when the trouble started. He says now that vandals cut hydraulic tubes on his vehicles, filled gas tanks with gravel, and even burned down a small cabin. The sheriff\'s office was called several times to mediate disputes.&lt;br&gt;Based on his estimate of the mineral value, Nichols had been trying without success to swap or sell his land to the Forest Service. Frustrated by this stalemate and the vandalism&mdash;and even as he began to charge climbers to cross this land and then bar them entirely&mdash;he let it be known that he was considering mining in the Silver Pick Basin, which would have severely limited access and potentially caused significant environmental damage.&lt;br&gt;&lt;div align=\"center\" class=\"image-right\" style=\"width: 506px;\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"/red-light-of-sunrise/538697\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Red Light of Sunrise\" height=\"325\" width=\"500\" src=\"/images/medium/538697.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=\"caption\"&gt;&lt;b&gt;First Light&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br&gt;Staffers for TPL-Colorado had been observing the conflict from a distance. Since 2001, TPL had been partnering with the Forest Service to acquire 8,000 acres of patented mining claims in the area of Red Mountain Pass, 20 miles east of Wilson Peak. \"This gave us incredible experience tackling thorny title issues,\" says TPL project manager Justin Spring, who has worked to retire former mining claims both at Red Mountain and in the High Elk Corridor, near Gunnison, where TPL has helped add more than 1,700 acres to White River National Forest.&lt;br&gt;\"We always wondered if there was a way for TPL to jump in and be the hero at Wilson Peak,\" Spring says. In 2006, former TPL project manager Jason Corzine reached out to Rusty Nichols to see if a way could be found around the impasse at Wilson Peak. As an independent nonprofit, TPL was able to raise donated funds for the project. For Nichols, one of the keys to the eventual agreement to protect climbing access was that TPL \"recognized the value of minerals that are still out there. They did everything they said they would. I have very high praise for their professionalism.\"&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As part of its initial agreement, TPL optioned 230 acres&mdash;23 mining claims, including the summit of Wilson Peak. Then the staff began the hard work of surveying, getting appraisals and environmental assessments, and conducting negotiations and fundraising. In October 2007, TPL bought the property, using donated funds and a crucial loan from the Colorado Conservation Trust, and hopes to transfer it to the Forest Service within the next few years. Nichols will retain 77 acres, including his cabin site, under a deed restriction that prohibits mining and limits residential development.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\"Bringing in a partner like TPL brings a couple of things to a project,\" says Corey Wong, a Forest Service public service staff officer for the Grand Mesa, Uncompahgre, and Gunnison National Forests. \"They do have more tools than we do and more relationships.\" With its ability to leverage donations, TPL acted with a swiftness that a government agency could not, Wong says, adding that the organization also acted as intermediary in the strained relationship between Nichols and the Forest Service.&lt;br&gt;Support for TPL\'s $3.25 million purchase of the land came from the Colorado Mountain Club Foundation, Coors Brewing Company, Lynne and Joe Horning, Dan and Sheryl Tishman, San Miguel Conservation Foundation, the Telluride Foundation, and numerous other individual donors.&lt;br&gt;&lt;div align=\"center\" class=\"image-left\" style=\"width: 381px;\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"/wilson-peaks-false-summit/538707\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Wilson Peaks False Summit\" height=\"500\" width=\"375\" src=\"/images/medium/538707.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=\"caption\"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Wilson Peak\'s False Summit&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br&gt;\"The permanent protection of Wilson Peak has inspired generosity from local donors and from people who\'ve only seen the mountain\'s image,\" said Tim Wohlgenant, TPL\'s Colorado State Director. \"Now we are working with our partners in the U.S. Forest Service and the climbing and mountaineering communities to relocate the main trail and officially restore access.\"&lt;br&gt;One key project supporter was the Colorado Conservation Trust (CCT), a statewide community foundation for conservation. Doug Robotham, former director of TPL\'s Colorado office and a deputy director at (CCT), says that TPL\'s work to protect the Fourteener&rsquo;s will further the recently launched Colorado Conservation Partnership Project. \"TPL and CCT are working with other groups to protect 24 of Colorado\'s most cherished natural and cultural landscapes&mdash;the best of the best,\" he says. \"The Wilson Peak region and the Mosquito Range are included, in part because access to the 14,000-foot peaks is so critical to experiencing what it means to live in or visit Colorado.\"&lt;br&gt;Wilson Peak is the first Colorado Fourteener where access has been purchased from a private landowner and will be restored to the public. TPL hopes to duplicate the effort elsewhere in the state. &lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;(The Trust for Public Land, May 1st. 2008)&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_14\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Recent Developments&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;u&gt;Release Date&lt;/u&gt;: Aug 3, 2011 &lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Contact(s)&lt;/b&gt;: Judy Schutza, District Ranger, U.S. Forest Service, 970-327-4261, Jason Corzine, Project Manager, The Trust for Public Land, 303-501-5570&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Norwood, CO., (August 3, 2011) &ndash; The Forest Service announces the opening of the new Rock of Ages Trail, located about 15 miles southwest of Telluride, Colorado. Opening this 3.7-mile hiking trail concludes a seven-year effort by the Forest Service and other organizations to restore public access to Wilson Peak, a popular &ldquo;fourteener&rdquo; in the Lizard Head Wilderness. A trail map and directions to the new Rock of Ages trailhead are posted on the Grand Mesa, Uncompahgre, and Gunnison National Forest website at www.fs.usda.gov/gmug under &ldquo;Highlights&rdquo;. &lt;br&gt;&ldquo;We are thrilled to open this new trail that will allow climbers to hike through Silver Pick Basin on their way to Wilson Peak&rdquo; said Judy Schutza, Norwood District Ranger. &ldquo;Public access would not have been restored without the efforts of The Trust for Public Land who purchased key private parcels on Wilson Peak and in Silver Pick Basin.&rdquo; &lt;br&gt;In July of 2004, a traditional route to Wilson Peak through private lands in Silver Pick Basin was closed. During the ensuing years, the Forest Service joined forces with The Trust for Public Land (TPL) to restore public access. San Miguel County, the Telluride Mountain Club and the Colorado Mountain Club were also key players in this effort.&lt;br&gt;In October of 2007, TPL took a significant step toward restoring public access by purchasing 230 acres of private land in Silver Pick Basin, including key parcels on the southwest ridge of Wilson Peak. The Forest Service made further progress in August of 2009 by completing the environmental analysis for the Rock of Ages Trail, however a trail easement across a private parcel in the upper basin was still needed to fully restore access. In May of 2011, the Forest Service obtained the needed trail easement. Construction of a new trailhead parking facility and access road were completed this week.&lt;br&gt;\"We\'re very excited to have reached this most important stage in the process,\" said Jason Corzine, Senior Project Manager with TPL. \"Restoring and preserving public access to this iconic peak has been TPL\'s main goal from the beginning.\" TPL continues to own the property they purchased in 2007 and is working to convey that land to the Forest Service.&lt;br&gt;Wilson Peak is among three 14,000-plus foot peaks in the Lizard Head Wilderness that annually draw thousands of climbing enthusiasts. The new Rock of Ages Trail provides a shorter route to these peaks than is currently offered by existing trails.&lt;br&gt;(USDA Website)&lt;br&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_15\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Topographic/Terrain Map&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;iframe width=\"825\" height=\"550\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\" marginheight=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" src=\"http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&amp;amp;source=s_q&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;geocode=&amp;amp;q=wilson+peak&amp;amp;aq=&amp;amp;sll=37.0625,-95.677068&amp;amp;sspn=46.764446,69.960938&amp;amp;ie=UTF8&amp;amp;hq=&amp;amp;hnear=Wilson+Peak&amp;amp;t=p&amp;amp;ll=37.860218,-107.984791&amp;amp;spn=0.074541,0.141621&amp;amp;z=13&amp;amp;output=embed\"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&amp;amp;source=embed&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;geocode=&amp;amp;q=wilson+peak&amp;amp;aq=&amp;amp;sll=37.0625,-95.677068&amp;amp;sspn=46.764446,69.960938&amp;amp;ie=UTF8&amp;amp;hq=&amp;amp;hnear=Wilson+Peak&amp;amp;t=p&amp;amp;ll=37.860218,-107.984791&amp;amp;spn=0.074541,0.141621&amp;amp;z=13\" style=\"color:#0000FF;text-align:left\"&gt;View Larger Map&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_16\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Current Access Map&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;iframe src=\"http://www.fs.usda.gov/Internet/FSE_DOCUMENTS/stelprdb5320677.pdf\" style=\"width:818px; height:700px;\" frameborder=\"0\"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/center&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_17\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Miscellaneous&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://www.14ers.org/\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"http://www.outdoorepic.com/uploads/9/5/9/1/9591026/9769757.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://www.listsofjohn.com/PeakStats/Climbers.php?Id=60\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"http://www.listsofjohn.com/board/styles/progray/imageset/site_logo.gif\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://www.14ers.com\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"http://s3.amazonaws.com/quarkbase_test.com/14ers.com-logo.gif\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://www.cmc.org/\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"http://www.climbing.com/community/events/CMC_logo.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;    &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://www.tetongravity.com/search/wilson%20Peak/\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"http://www.traceyknutson.com/images/logo_tgr.gif\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://www.14ers.com/php14ers/tripreport.php?trip=9876&amp;amp;parmpeak=Wilson+Peak&amp;amp;cpgm=tripmain&amp;amp;ski=Include\"&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;font color=\"green\"&gt;Awesome ski report from Ben Conners&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://www.14ers.com/php14ers/tripreport.php?trip=10565&amp;amp;parmpeak=Wilson+Peak&amp;amp;cpgm=tripmain&amp;amp;ski=Include\"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Great report from the Bilk Basin Approach.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;i&gt;-TONS of pictures!&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://14ers.com/php14ers/tripreport.php?trip=5837\"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Great ski report from Doumall of all three peaks.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;i&gt;-Wilson Peak, Mt.

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;Mount Temple is a giant that dominates the view south of Lake Louise. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Temple was the first peak in the Canadian Rockies over 11,000 feet to be climbed.  It was in 1894 a group of three trekked up the SW ridge.  In the present day that route sees a lot of traffic each year. It\'s a great way to spend a day in the mountains with a pleasant approach to Sentinel Pass and then some good sweating up the ridge to the summit.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For the mountaineer searching for more of a challenge, the East Ridge is considered to be one of the 50 classic climbs in North America.  It\'s an aesthetic line that drops right down towards the Trans-Canada Highway.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;Elevation gain from the trailhead 1,690 metres&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_2\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Getting There&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;div align=\"center\" class=\"image-left\" style=\"width: 206px;\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"/mount-temple-from-saddle-mountain/462463\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Mount Temple from Saddle Mountain\" height=\"112\" width=\"200\" src=\"/images/small/462463.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=\"caption\"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;You will have to get yourself to Lake Louise. From Calgary take the Trans Canada (1) west through Canmore, Banff, then Drive to Lake Louise along the #1. After driving by the Samson Mall area continue along the road up towards the Chateau. Take the signed left turn towards Moraine Lake.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For the SW ridge, take the road to Moraine Lake. Note you should get there early as the parking lot is not very large and tends to fill up early. The trail head is found 100 yards along the lake to the right. Follow the obvious trail up the switchbacks up to Larch Valley. Then once you have passed the trees at the point where you will find two benches, from here follow the obvious trail that winds its way gently to Sentinal pass then continues up, to the right winding its way through the scree to the summit. Depending on the weather there can be a couple of slippery sections but nothing in the way of great difficulty. This is an excellent day of hiking/scrambling.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For climbers attempting the East Ridge start at either the Paradise Valley Parking Lot for the Ammer Couloir start or for the more direct \'Big Steps\' start park at a pullout on the south side of the road about 2 km from Moraine Lake. Both starts join the East Ridge just below the Black Towers.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_3\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Red Tape&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;table class=\"thumb\"&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div style=\"width:770px;height:330px;overflow:auto;\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"http://www.summitpost.org/images/original/556741.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=\"magnify\" style=\"float: right; margin-top: 5px;\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=556741\" title=\"View Pano\"&gt; &lt;img src=\"/images/layout/abby/magnify.gif\" alt=\"Enlarge\" style=\"\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;font color=\"black\"&gt;Summit view from Mount Temple&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;You will need a Parks pass. This can be picked up as you enter the Park on the highway near Banff. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Rates for Parks Canada as of July 1, 2009:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Wilderness Backcountry: $9.80/night&lt;br&gt;Wilderness Pass: $68.70/year&lt;br&gt;Reservation Fee: $11.70&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Park Entry:&lt;br&gt;$16/group/day&lt;br&gt;$136.40/year&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;One other item of note. Due to bear activity, to go up from the parking lot to Larch valley. You now have to travel in groupes of 4 or more. Wait at the trail head for the correct amount of people and then proceed as a group. You have to do the same at the benches upon your return. This may seen like a hassle but there are so many people that groups are formed easily and everyone is aware of the rule. One thing is try and ensure that everone is of the approximate level of speed and fitness as the groups will break up on the way up or down and you could be hassled or even fined by the park personal.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Call the Banff Information Center for current news (403) 762-4256.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This is a very sensitive area. It sees a lot of traffic. Please obey all of the signs.  Stay on the trails and of course pack out all of your garbage, including apple cores and banana peels (they can attract animals).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_4\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;When To Climb&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;div align=\"center\" class=\"image-left\" style=\"width: 206px;\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"/mt-temple-s-normal-route-from/128134\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Mt Temple s normal route from...\" height=\"150\" width=\"200\" src=\"/images/small/128134.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=\"caption\"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;The summer months are the most popular. This route and many others are well described in the guidebook &lt;a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0921102674/summitpost-20/104-3172218-8275929\"&gt;Scrambles in the Canadian Rockies&lt;/a&gt; by Alan Kane.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Temple has seen winter ascents.

But there are many campsites in the Lake Louise area. One place that is recommended is the ACC/Hostel in Lake Louise. This place has a small cosy restaurent with good food as well as kitchen facilities and lots of room for approx 36$ Canadian a night. While this is twice as much as the ACC lodge in Canmore it is still a bargin when compaired to the cost of hotels in the area.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There is no camping allowed on the mountain or in the Larch Valley area.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For Lake Louise Area camping spots call (403) 762-3600.&lt;br&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_6\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Mountain Conditions&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;div align=\"center\" class=\"image-left\" style=\"width: 206px;\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"/mount-temple/192273\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Mount Temple\" height=\"149\" width=\"200\" src=\"/images/small/192273.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=\"caption\"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;Check with the Rangers in Lake Louise. You can sign in and out (probably wise to do so.. but remember to sign out!) Beware of the the weather conditions and dress accordingly. If the weather turns trails can ice up and people can get into trouble because they went up in nice weather then the slabs and scree iced up in the snow or rain and made the route very dicy for the decent. Excellent scramble.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;www.weatheroffice.com or (403) 762-2088 for weather conditions.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Banff Warden Office 403 762 1470 for route info.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Lake Louise Warden Office 403 762 1470&lt;br&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_7\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The Alpine Club of Canada&lt;/h2&gt;Try this for activities in the area&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://www.banfflakelouise.com\"&gt;Banff Lake Louise Tourist Bureau&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Joining a club such as The Alpine Club of Canada is recommended when climbing in Canada. While it is not obligatory, useful information can be had at any of their main Clubhouse in Canmore, or at their website which is open to everyone.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://www.alpineclubofcanada.ca/\"&gt;http://www.alpineclubofcanada.ca/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Staying at the club in Canmore is 15$ Canadian for members and 19$ for non-members. It can get quite crowded in the summer so a reservation is recommended. Staying at the hostel in Lake Louise is more at 36$ Canadian but is good value for the money.&lt;br&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_8\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;External Links&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://alpineclub-edm.org/accidents/location.asp?where=58\"&gt;Accident History&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://www.summitpost.org/mountains/trip_report.pl?trip_report_id=1760&amp;amp;mountain_id=2217\"&gt;World\'s Best Alpine Climbing Trip...(ver. 2003)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_9\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Images&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div align=\"center\"&gt;&lt;table id=\"my_images\"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/mount-eiffel-and-pinnacle/488763/c-150408\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Mount Eiffel and Pinnacle\" src=\"/images/square/488763.JPG\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/mount-temple-from-saddle-mountain/462463/c-150408\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Mount Temple from Saddle Mountain\" src=\"/images/square/462463.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/moraine-lake-at-dusk/766164/c-150408\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Moraine Lake At Dusk\" src=\"/images/square/766164.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/mt-temple-s-normal-route-from/128134/c-150408\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Mt Temple\\\'s normal route from...\" src=\"/images/square/128134.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/mount-temple-panorama-2/556742/c-150408\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Mount Temple Panorama 2\" src=\"/images/square/556742.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/surrounding-giants/766338/c-150408\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Surrounding Giants\" src=\"/images/square/766338.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/pinnacle-mtn-and-eiffel-peak/472136/c-150408\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Pinnacle Mtn and Eiffel Peak\" src=\"/images/square/472136.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/deltaform-and-mount-allen/555523/c-150408\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Deltaform and Mount Allen\" src=\"/images/square/555523.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/mt-temple-s-east-ridge-left/111599/c-150408\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Mt.

It is easily seen from the town of Big Pine, the Sherwin grade north of Bishop, and the White and Inyo Mountains. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Joseph LeConte named the peak in memory of Edward Rowland Sill, a poet and teacher in the Oakland area and at the University of California. Before Europeans came along it was known to the local Paiute, who worship it in their ceremonies, as &lt;i&gt;Nee-ma-mee-shee&lt;/i&gt; (Guardian of the Valley).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Mount Sill is the second-highest peak in the Palisade Range (North Palisade is 89 feet higher). The first recorded ascent was in 1903 by Joseph LeConte, James Moffitt, James Hutchinson, and Robert Pike, who ascended the &lt;a href=\"http://www.summitpost.org/route/157070/southwest-slope.html\"&gt;Southwest Slope&lt;/a&gt;. Mount Sill has attracted climbers since the earliest days of mountaineering in the Sierra, including such luminaries as Walter Starr Jr, John Mendenhall, and Norman Clyde. There are at least 10 established routes on the peak, ranging in difficulty from class 2/3 to 5.10. The classic route is the 1938 &lt;a href=\"http://www.summitpost.org/route/156548/swiss-ar-te.html\"&gt;Swiss Arete&lt;/a&gt;, which ascends the rib above Glacier Notch.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Its summit provides a &lt;a href=\"http://www.hikinglasvegas.com/panoramas/sill.html\"&gt;commanding view&lt;/a&gt; of the entire Palisade range and surrounding peaks. Indeed, R.J. Secor opines that, \"Mount Sill has the best summit view of any peak in the Sierra.\" While such a judgment is certainly subjective, it is indicative of the reward awaiting those who reach its summit.&lt;br&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_2\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Getting There&lt;/h2&gt;There are many ways to get to Mount Sill, but most routes begin either from Glacier Lodge or South Lake. Glacier Lodge is at the end of Glacier Lodge Road, which heads west from the town of Big Pine on US 395. South Lake is reached by driving west on Highway 168 out of Bishop until you come to the intersection with South Lake Road. Turn left on South Lake Road, and follow it to the hiker parking area at the end above the dam.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Below are three possible approaches starting from Glacier Lodge. A topo sketching out a few more options is &lt;a href=\"http://www.summitpost.org/view_object.php?object_id=59000\"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;1) Hike the North Fork of Big Pine Creek, camp just below the Palisade Glacier. Glacier Notch - which separates Mount Gayley from Mount Sill - may be a bit harder to reach from this side because it involves crossing a bergschrund and some class 3 rock below the notch. However, the hike in is easier than the cross-country South Fork approach. Glacier Notch is the start of the Swiss Arete and North Couloir routes. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;2) An enjoyable and less crowded approach to Mt Sill follows the South Fork of Big Pine Creek (cross country, class 2), to base camps somewhere below Mount Gayley and Temple Crag.  Much talus is encountered on this approach.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;3) To gain the Southwest slope of Mount Sill, you may hike the SF of  Big Pine Creek up to Elinore Lake and then on over Scimitar Pass (~13,200ft). Follow the crest past Mt. Jepson into the basin at the base of Sill and Peak 13961. Polemonium Glacier terminates in this basin. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;From South Lake hike over Bishop Pass, skirt the Palisades\' Western aspect over Thunderbolt Pass and Knapsack Pass to gain the Southwest slope of Mount Sill.&lt;br&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_3\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Routes&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;noformat&gt;&lt;table align=\"CENTER\" cellspacing=\"1\" cellpadding=\"5\" bgcolor=\"#000000\" width=\"90%\"&gt;     &lt;tr valign=\"TOP\"&gt;  &lt;th bgcolor=\"#FFFFFF\"&gt;Route&lt;/th&gt;  &lt;th bgcolor=\"#FFFFFF\"&gt;Grade&lt;/th&gt;  &lt;th bgcolor=\"#FFFFFF\"&gt;Notes &lt;/th&gt;  &lt;/tr&gt;    &lt;tr valign=\"TOP\"&gt;  &lt;td bgcolor=\"#DDDDCC\" nowrap&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt; &lt;a href=\"http://www.summitpost.org/route/157070/southwest-slope.html\"&gt;Southwest Slope&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; &lt;/td&gt;  &lt;td bgcolor=\"#DDDDCC\"&gt; Class 2/3 &lt;/td&gt;  &lt;td bgcolor=\"#DDDDCC\"&gt; FA 1903 by Joseph LeConte, James Moffitt, James Hutchinson, and Robert Pike.

While there is nothing to match the solitude, quiet, and incomparable beauty of the winter, avalanches are a reality. Be prepared for difficult conditions and to assess avalanche potential if you head up in the winter. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Spring and early summer can offer good travel conditions on South Fork approaches, as the copious talus is largely buried. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There are many resources available to find out current conditions in the area:  &lt;p&gt;  Staff at the White Mountain Ranger Station can provide &lt;a href=\"http://www.fs.fed.us/r5/inyo/conditions/index.shtml\"&gt;current conditions&lt;/a&gt; during the summer months (though they may be a bit on the conservative side if asked about the need for foul weather gear, crampons, etc.) Information on winter/spring snow conditions can also be found on the web: &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://cdec.water.ca.gov/snow/current/snow/\"&gt;Snowpack conditions&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://www.csac.org/Bulletins/Calif/esierra.php\"&gt;Avalanche Hazard (winter only)&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a name=\"chapter_6\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Camping&lt;/h2&gt;There are several Forest Service campgrounds along the road to South Lake as well as in the Big Pine Creek area. Check out the Forest Service &lt;a href=\"http://www.fs.fed.us/r5/inyo/recreation/campgrounds.shtml\"&gt;website&lt;/a&gt; for details.

Marking the southern end of the Cascade Range, Lassen Peak is visible from throughout the region, particularly from the Sacramento Valley, which lies west of the mountain.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;While only a fraction of volume of Mount Shasta, and nearly 4,000 feet shorter, Lassen Peak is still a mountain that demands respect.  The peak is the second highest summit in the northern part of California (after Mount Shasta, of course), is the 9th highest summit in the entire Cascade Range (which extends from British Columbia in Canada to the area just south of Lassen Peak) and is one of the 57 ultra-prominence peaks (ranked 51st) in the contiguous United States.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Despite these impressive figures, Lassen Peak remains one of the most accessible volcanoes in the Cascades.  No technical climbing is required to reach the summit, and the numerous trails in the surrounding region provide a host of opportunities to view the mountain from a variety of perspectives.  The two most popular vantage points are from the Manzanita Lake area northwest of the mountain, and from Lake Helen, due south of the summit.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;While Lassen Peak was a central landmark in the region prior to 1914, the mountains\' eruption brought added attention to the mountain.  Prior to the mountains\' awakening, no volcanoes had erupted in any of the states of that time.  A particularly massive eruption occurred in 1915, which prompted the creation of Lassen Volcanic National Park the following year.  The mountain and its volcanic legacy are the obvious centerpieces of the park, though numerous other volcanic features such as cinder cones and lava flows are worthy additions to the National Park.  The park also boasts excellent wilderness backcountry.&lt;br&gt;&lt;div align=\"center\" class=\"image-right\" style=\"width: 506px;\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"/lassen-peak/511117\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Lassen Peak\" height=\"375\" width=\"500\" src=\"/images/medium/511117.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=\"caption\"&gt;Lake Helen from the southern flank of Lassen Peak&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br&gt;Geothermal activity around Lassen Peak provides potent testimony to the violent past that created the volcano.  The Sulphur Works and Bumpass Hell are easily accessed from the main road around the base of Lassen Peak.  All geothermal features except geysers can be observed here, particularly at Bumpass Hell.  The Drakesbad area also features substantial geothermal activity.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Lassen Peak actually formed along a side vent of Mt. Tehama that eventually collapsed in on itself, becoming a \"plug-dome\" volcano.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;During the winter and spring Lassen is popular ski mountaineering and snowboard destination.  Summer to autumn hiking on this peak is straight-forward following a tourist trail which asends the Southeast Ridge to the summit from the 8,500\' Lassen Peak trailhead. Due to its location, Lassen Peak may receive more snow than any other part of California, often with 30+ foot snow drifts above 8,000 feet, making it an ideal mountain summit for ski mountaineering, backcountry snowboarding, and general mountaineering. After the road is plowed in late spring it is even possible to hike up the south side in sandals to ski / snowboard down.

Geologists believe the old mountain rose in excess of 12,000 feet, prior to its final eruption.  It is believed that its final eruption decimated much of the mountain, greatly diminishing its height and bulk. Following the eruptive period, substantial glaciation further reduced the mountain to a series of ridges and smaller peaks.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Today, all that remains of the original Mount Tehama is Brokeoff Mountain and Mount Diller.  They constitute what would have been the southwestern flank of the prehistoric volcano.  While the original mountain my have been ruined, the forces beneath the earth that both created and destroyed it are still at work.  The abundance of geothermal activity is living testimony to this.  More dramatic still, Lassen Peak itself is evidence of the volcanic power still surging beneath the mountain.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_4\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Formation of Lassen Peak&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In the wake of the destruction of Mount Tehama, the forces that obliterated the mountain, volcanism and glaciation remained active.  Over time, the lava beneath Mount Tehama began pushing its way through the wreckage of the former mountain, uplifting the earth above it.  Ultimately, it broke through the rocky debris left over from Tehama\'s eruption.  Once it reached its current height, glaciers went to work scouring its sides and giving the mountain its present shape.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_5\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Eruptions: 1914-1921&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Beginning in 1914, Lassen Peak began a period of eruptive activity.  Minor eruptions occurred intermittently for a year.  On May 22, 1915 the mountain experienced massive eruption.  The ash plume rose over 30,000 feet and spread ash over 200 miles to the east.  The area immediately to the east of the volcano was destroyed, striped of its trees and soils and massive rocks were strewn throughout the area.  Many of these rocks were too hot to touch for days after the eruption.  While the 1915 eruption was the peak of the activity, smaller eruptions continued for six more years, finally ceasing in 1921.  It was because of the events during this period that Lassen Volcanic National Park was created.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;May 1915 Eruption Images:&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;table class=\"inline_image_thumbs\"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=410110\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/410110.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=410108\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/410108.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=410109\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/410109.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br clear=\"ALL\"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_6\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Geography&lt;/h2&gt;Coming soon...&lt;br&gt;&lt;div align=\"center\" class=\"image-right\" style=\"width: 506px;\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"/this-is-looking-east-from-the/130113\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"This is looking east from the...\" height=\"375\" width=\"500\" src=\"/images/medium/130113.JPG\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=\"caption\"&gt;The east buttress of Lassen Peak from the summit&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br clear=\"ALL\"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_7\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Lassen Peak Map&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div align=\"center\" class=\"image\" style=\"width: 460px;\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"/lassen-peak/814286\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Lassen Peak\" height=\"500\" width=\"454\" src=\"/images/medium/814286.JPG\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=\"caption\"&gt;Lassen Peak&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_8\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Lassen Volcanic National Park&lt;/h2&gt;Coming Soon...&lt;br&gt;&lt;div align=\"center\" class=\"image-left\" style=\"width: 506px;\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"/lassen-peak/511112\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Lassen Peak\" height=\"375\" width=\"500\" src=\"/images/medium/511112.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=\"caption\"&gt;Lassen Peak from Helen Lake&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br clear=\"ALL\"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_9\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Lassen Volcanic National Park Map&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div align=\"center\" class=\"image\" style=\"width: 506px;\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"/lassen-volcanic-national-park/814285\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Lassen Volcanic National Park\" height=\"429\" width=\"500\" src=\"/images/medium/814285.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=\"caption\"&gt;Lassen Volcanic National Park&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_10\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Routes Overview&lt;/h2&gt;During the summer, the only route to the summit that is permitted is the Lassen Peak Trail, however, during the winter and spring many other routes are open for climbing and skiing / boarding.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Going counter clockwise from the south:&lt;br&gt;&bull; &lt;a href=\"http://www.summitpost.com/mountains/route_link.pl/route_id/172/object_id/271\"&gt;South Face&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&bull; &lt;a href=\"http://www.summitpost.org/route/410106/lassen-peak-trail.html\"&gt;Lassen Peak Trail&lt;/a&gt; (Southeast Ridge)&lt;br&gt;&bull; Southeast Face (aka East Face)&lt;br&gt;&bull; &lt;a href=\"http://www.summitpost.com/mountains/route_link.pl?route_id=662&amp;amp;object_id=271\"&gt;Northeast Face&lt;/a&gt; (aka North Face)&lt;br&gt;&bull; &lt;a href=\"http://www.summitpost.com/mountains/route_link.pl/route_id/642/object_id/271\"&gt;North Ridge&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&bull; West Face&bull; Southwest Face&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For a great map of the area showing most climbing and skiing routes, take a look at &lt;a href=\"http://www.skimountaineer.com/CascadeSki/Lassen/LassenSkiRoutesMap.jpg\"&gt;Amar Andalkar\'s Lassen Topographic Route Map&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_11\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Current Conditions&lt;/h2&gt;-&lt;b&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://forecast.weather.gov/MapClick.php?lat=40.48873742102281&amp;amp;lon=-121.50569915771484&amp;amp;site=mfr&amp;amp;smap=1&amp;amp;marine=0&amp;amp;unit=0&amp;amp;lg=en\"&gt;Current NOAA / National Weather Service Forecast for Lassen Peak&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_12\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Getting There&lt;/h2&gt;Year round trailheads to this peak are on the Lassen Loop Road whether you are driving to the Lassen Peak trailhead on the South Side or cross-country skiing from the Manzanita Lake or Mineral entrances to Lassen Volcanic National Park.&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;LASSEN PEAK TRAILHEAD FROM NORTH: To reach this summer trailhead, leave I-5 at Redding heading East on California SR-44. Continue South on to California SR-89 at the junction and drive another 22 miles past the Manzanita Lake park entrance to the trailhead.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;LASSEN PEAK TRAILHEAD FROM SOUTH: Leave I-5 at Red Bluff heading East on California SR-36 towards Mineral. Turn north at the SR-89 junction and continue 12 miles into the park to reach the trailhead.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;EMIGRANT PASS / DEVASTATED AREA (6,446\'): There is a gate on CA SR-89 at Emigrant Pass that is just south of the Devastated Area parking lot. This is about 10 miles from the northern entrance of the park. When the road is plowed this is a popular trailhead for the North Ridge, Northeast Face, and Southeast Face routes.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;WINTER VISITS: Most of the Lassen Loop Road is not plowed during the winter, however, the south Mineral entrance is plowed to the Lassen Chalet and visitor center including the relatively large parking lot from where you can ski into the park. To the North, SR-89 is plowed until the Manzanita Lake trailhead from where you can ski in.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_13\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Red Tape&lt;/h2&gt;Lassen Volcanic National Park is part of the US National Parks Service and a park entrance fee is charged. As of June 2008, a 7-Day vehicle entry pass is $10 and an annual pass to just this park is $25.  You also have the option of purchasing an American the Beautiful - National Parks and Federal Recreational Lands Annual Pass for $80.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As fees and information may change, please take a look at the following links for the latest and greatest:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&bull; &lt;a href=\"http://www.nps.gov/lavo/planyourvisit/feesandreservations.htm\"&gt;Lassen Volcanic National Park Fees&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&bull; &lt;a href=\"http://store.usgs.gov/pass/general.html\"&gt;America the Beautiful Pass Info&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_14\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;When To Climb and Ski&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;div align=\"center\" class=\"image-right\" style=\"width: 206px;\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"/ascending-during-solid/4743\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Ascending during solid...\" height=\"133\" width=\"200\" src=\"/images/small/4743.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=\"caption\"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br&gt;Generally, people climb June to October, but ascents are possible year round. The ski season is typically from February to early June. During the winter the most of the Lassen Loop Road isn\'t plowed which means you\'ll have a much longer approach. See the Getting There Section above for more information. This often means that people will opt to ski &lt;a href=\"http://www.summitpost.com/mountains/mountain_link.pl/mountain_id/900\"&gt;Brokeoff Mountain&lt;/a&gt; and other peaks closer to the south Mineral entrance station.&lt;a name=\"chapter_15\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Camping&lt;/h2&gt;If all you\'re interested in doing is climbing up the trail to the summit, then camping probably isn\'t required.

With its distinctive \"cross\" of snow rising directly above the southwest corner of Lake Tahoe, Mount Tallac commands attention.  While neither the highest peak in the area nor the hardest to summit, Mount Tallac nonetheless serves up enough adventure to satisfy nearly everyone.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Compared to the giants of the southern Sierra Nevada, Mount Tallac is a mere child, standing at only 9735 feet above sea level.  Still, it stands over 3,500 feet above the surface of Lake Tahoe, and from the summit, one may take in panoramic views of that amazing lake, as well as the enchanting peaks of Desolation Wilderness area.  (&lt;a href=\"http://www.tahoebackcountry.net/features/tallac02/images/tallacsummitpano.jpg\"&gt;Click here&lt;/a&gt; to see a 270 degree panorama from the summit).  The views from the summit, as well as the mountain\'s proximity to highway 89 and its wide selection of terrain types, make Mount Tallac one of the top hiking and backcountry skiing destinations in California.   &lt;div align=\"center\" class=\"image-left\" style=\"width: 206px;\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"/cresting-the-top-of-tallac-s/38381\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Cresting the top of Tallac s...\" height=\"150\" width=\"200\" src=\"/images/small/38381.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=\"caption\"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Geologically, Mount Tallac is situated roughly on the boundary between the granites of the Sierra Nevada batholith, and the earlier metamorphosed sedimentary rocks.  The southern and eastern slopes, especially Cathedral Peak, are crumbly, clinky \"metaseds\", while the other parts of the mountain are a bit more solid, but not Sierran granite, quite like Mount Ritter.   &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_2\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Overview of Principal Climbing Routes on Mount Tallac&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div align=\"center\" class=\"image\" style=\"width: 481px;\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"/annotated-topo-map-showing/8581\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Annotated Topo Map showing...\" height=\"500\" width=\"475\" src=\"/images/medium/8581.JPG\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=\"caption\"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;1) &lt;a href=\"http://www.summitpost.com/mountains/route_link.pl/route_id/377/object_id/289\"&gt;Northeast Ridge&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/b&gt; - This is the most direct (and thus the steepest) route to the summit.  However, this route is really only feasible in winter, when the snow blankets the insanely thick and prickly bushes that grow like wildfire on the lower half of this route.  Not surprisingly, the NE Ridge is the most popular route with skiers, snowboarders and snowshoers during prime season.  It provides quick access to the summit, it usually contains a \"boot pack\" step trail, and it parallels the popular northeast bowl ski descent.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;2) &lt;a href=\"http://www.summitpost.com/mountains/route_link.pl/route_id/378/object_id/289\"&gt;Glen Alpine Trail&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/b&gt; - A long (5.4 mile) route up the south side of Tallac, starting at the popular Lily Lake trailhead.  Great views into Desolation Wilderness and of Gilmore Lake. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;3) &lt;a href=\"http://www.summitpost.com/mountains/route_link.pl/route_id/381/object_id/289\"&gt;Mount Tallac (Cathedral Lake) Trail&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/b&gt; - In some circles, this is the \"official\" summer trail up Mount Tallac.  Shorter (4.99 miles) than the Glen Alpine Trail, with equally beautiful views of Fallen Leaf Lake and Lake Tahoe on the ascent.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;4) &lt;a href=\"http://www.summitpost.com/mountains/route_link.pl/route_id/274/object_id/289\"&gt;Southeast Chutes&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/b&gt; - A more fun (IMHO) variation on the Mount Tallac Trail, this route follows the main trail for the first 1/3rd, then involves some easy class 2/3 scrambling up the chutes above Floating Island Lake to the summit ridge.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div align=\"center\" class=\"image-right\" style=\"width: 206px;\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"/may-12-2004-the-way-to-the/53002\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"May 12, 2004.

Not as convenient as Sacramento or Reno-Tahoe, but it would be a better option for international travelers. Other options in the Bay Area are Oakland International and San Jose International Airports.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&middot;	&lt;b&gt;Sacramento International Airport &lt;/b&gt;: is located north west of Sacramento, and is the biggest airport within  two hours drive of Lake Tahoe.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&middot;	&lt;b&gt;Reno-Tahoe International Airport&lt;/b&gt;: is located in Reno and is the closest major airport to Mount Tallac and the whole Lake Tahoe Basin.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&middot;	&lt;b&gt;Lake Tahoe Airport&lt;/b&gt;: is located in Tahoe Valley between Meyers and the city of South Lake Tahoe. It can actually be seen from the summit of Mount Tallac, but it is a small airport and probably more expensive to fly into.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Public Transportation:&lt;/b&gt; Greyhound buses from Reno, Sacramento, and San Francisco to either Truckee, California, or South Lake Tahoe, California.  Local bus transit between South Lake Tahoe and Truckee.  Amtrak trains from Reno/San Francisco/Sacramento to Truckee.  &lt;p&gt;  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Private Vehicle:&lt;/b&gt; Follow the above airport links to get from major metropolitan areas to the vicinity of Camp Richardson, California, on State Highway 89 (&lt;a href=\"http://maps.yahoo.com/py/maps.py?Pyt=Tmap&amp;amp;addr=&amp;amp;csz=Camp+Richardson,+CA&amp;amp;country=us&amp;amp;name=\"&gt;detail map&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_5\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Mount Tallac Trailheads&lt;/h2&gt;There are three main trailheads with reasonable access to Mount Tallac:  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;1) Lily Lake trailhead&lt;/b&gt; is at the end of Fallen Leaf Lake Road, which has signs from 89, 1/2 mile north (toward Truckee) from Camp Richardson.  You\'ll find a paved parking lot here.  Access point for &lt;a href=\"http://www.summitpost.com/mountains/route_link.pl/route_id/378/object_id/289\"&gt;Glen Alpine Trail&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;2) Mount Tallac trailhead&lt;/b&gt; is located about 3/4 mile north on CA 89 from Camp Richardson, directly across the highway from Baldwin Beach.  The turnoff is well-signed.  If you are coming from the north, this is first right turn after Spring Creek Road (just after the \"25 MPH\" right hand curve).  If you are coming from the south, it is a left turn about 3/4 mile past the Lake Tahoe Visitor Center.  Once you are heading east on this paved road, follow the signs to \"Mount Tallac Trailhead\".  This trailhead is used for the &lt;a href=\"http://www.summitpost.com/mountains/route_link.pl/route_id/381/object_id/289\"&gt;Mount Tallac Trail&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"http://www.summitpost.com/mountains/route_link.pl/route_id/274/object_id/289\"&gt;Southeast Chutes&lt;/a&gt; variation   &lt;div align=\"center\" class=\"image-left\" style=\"width: 506px;\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"/mount-tallac/548851\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Mount Tallac\" height=\"375\" width=\"500\" src=\"/images/medium/548851.JPG\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=\"caption\"&gt;Tallac from Gilmore Lake&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;3) The Spring Creek trailhead&lt;/b&gt;, located in the subdivision NW of Fallen Leaf Lake, provides the shortest route to the summit.   To get here, follow Highway 89 north from Camp Richardson towards Emerald Bay, then turn left (west) on Spring Creek Road.  Coming from the north, the right-hand turnoff is just past the long Emerald Bay switchback.  Coming from the south, it is the first left turn after the Baldwin Beach/Tallac Trailhead turnoff.  Follow Spring Creek Road up into the neighborhood, always bearing left at the forks until you get to Wiyot Road, where you bear right and run into a dead end.  Park here in one of the two turnouts, or park off the road back on Spring Creek.  If you are coming on the weekend, get here early.  If you\'re coming after 9 am on a powder day, fuhgeddaboudit...  This trailhead accesses the &lt;a href=\"http://www.summitpost.com/mountains/route_link.pl/route_id/377/object_id/289\"&gt;Northeast ridge&lt;/a&gt; route.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_6\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Mount Tallac Camping &amp;amp; Red Tape&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;div align=\"center\" class=\"image-right\" style=\"width: 206px;\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"/a-view-of-the-trail/309836\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"A View of the Trail\" height=\"150\" width=\"200\" src=\"/images/small/309836.JPG\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=\"caption\"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;Probably because it is so close to population centers and easy to access from major highways, the Desolation Wilderness is one of the most heavily used wilderness areas in the country.  To preserve its natural beauty, the Forest Service has restricted use to hikers, horses, llamas and the like. In Desolation Wilderness there are no buildings or roads. Bicycles and motorized vehicles are not permitted. Further, no wood fires are allowed -- you must use a camp stove.   &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;You must have a permit for either day-use or overnight camping in Desolation.  There are fees for overnight camping year-round. From the Friday before Memorial Day to September 30th, a quota of 700 overnight users entering each day is in effect.  Under the quota, each trailhead has its own allowance of overnight visitors who enter each day. It is wise to call ahead. Your permit is good at only the trailhead you reserve, only on the date of entry and only for the number of people specified.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The maximum group size for a permit is 12, and stays are limited to 14 consecutive days. During the off-quota season there is no limit to the number of overnight users.  &lt;p&gt;  Day-use is currently not limited any time of year; however, the Forest Service may change this policy in the future if usage gets out of hand.  Self-issue day use permits are available at most popular trailheads (but not the Spring Creek trailhead).   &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This &lt;a href=\"http://www.fs.fed.us/r5/ltbmu/recreation/wilderness/desowild/fees.shtml\"&gt;USFS page&lt;/a&gt; on fees outlines the complicated (and excessive, IMO) fee schedule for overnight permits in the Desolation Wilderness.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div align=\"center\" class=\"image-left\" style=\"width: 139px;\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"/tallac-s-rocky-summit-20/8772\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Tallac s rocky summit, 20...\" height=\"200\" width=\"133\" src=\"/images/small/8772.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=\"caption\"&gt;Get an early start.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;According the this &lt;a href=\"http://www.fs.fed.us/r5/ltbmu/recreation/wilderness/desowild/permits.shtml\"&gt;USFS\'s page&lt;/a&gt; permits for overnight camping in Desolation Wilderness must be picked up at one of three locations:  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;1) Eldorado National Forest Information Center&lt;/b&gt;, located five miles east of Placerville on Highway 50.     3070 Camino Heights Drive, Camino, CA 95709       Phone: (530)644-6048       Open seven days a week, 8:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. with extended hours in the summer.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;2) Lake Tahoe Visitor Center&lt;/b&gt;, located three miles north of the Highway 50/89 junction at South Lake Tahoe, on Highway 89.  Open summer only.      Call for hours, phone: (530)573-2674  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;3) Lake Tahoe Basin Management Unit&lt;/b&gt;, located two blocks north of the Highway 50/89 junction in South Lake Tahoe on Highway 89.  Phone: (530)573-2694  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Note:&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;  Self issue permits are not available at the Spring Creek trailhead.  However, although I don\'t advocate lawlessness, not a single person I know has ever gotten a permit to do a backcountry ski tour on Mount Tallac.  In theory, you could get a permit at the visitor center prior to heading up the trail, so act according to your own ethic and sense of law &amp;amp; order.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_7\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Mount Tallac Conditions&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://www.dot.ca.gov/cgi-bin/roads.cgi\"&gt;Caltrans Current Highway Conditions&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://www.fs.fed.us/htnf/\"&gt; Humboldt-Toiyabe National Forest &lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://www.r5.fs.fed.us/ltbmu/\"&gt; Lake Tahoe Basin Management Unit &lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://www.fs.fed.us/r5/eldorado/\"&gt; El Dorado National Forest &lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://cdec.water.ca.gov/cgi-progs/iodir/WEAZCAIC\"&gt; Updated Weather Information&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;!-- Start WxSticker --&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;table cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" style=\"width: 271px; background-color: #FFF; border: 1px solid #999;\"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td colspan=\"2\"&gt;&lt;div style=\"height: 35px;\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://www.wunderground.com/US/CA/South_Lake_Tahoe.html?bannertypeclick=htmlSticker\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"http://banners.wunderground.com/weathersticker/htmlSticker1/language/www/US/CA/South_Lake_Tahoe.gif\" alt=\"\" height=\"35\" width=\"271\" style=\"border: 0px;\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style=\"vertical-align: top;\"&gt;&lt;div style=\"width: 101px;\"&gt;&lt;div style=\"height: 22px;\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"http://icons-pe.wxug.com/graphics/smash/htmlsticker/html_linkT.gif\" width=\"101\" height=\"22\"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=\"font-family: Geneva, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 10px; background-image: url(http://icons-pe.wxug.com/graphics/smash/htmlsticker/html_linkBG.gif); text-align: left;\"&gt;&lt;div style=\"padding-left: 10px;\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://www.wunderground.com/history/airport/KTVL/1972/1/1/PlannerHistory.html?bannertypeclick=htmlSticker\"&gt;Plan your trip&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=\"padding-left: 10px;\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://www.wunderground.com/radar/radblast.asp?ID=RGX&amp;amp;region=b1&amp;amp;lat=38.88500977&amp;amp;lon=-120.03504944\"&gt;Local Radar&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=\"padding-left: 10px;\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://www.wunderground.com/US/CA/South_Lake_Tahoe.html?bannertypeclick=htmlSticker\"&gt;Detailed Forecast&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=\"height: 12px;\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"http://icons-pe.wxug.com/graphics/smash/htmlsticker/html_linkB.gif\" width=\"101\" height=\"12\"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;form action=\"http://www.wunderground.com/cgi-bin/findweather/getForecast\" method=\"get\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 0px; text-align: center;\"&gt;&lt;input type=\"hidden\" name=\"bannertypeclick\" value=\"htmlSticker\"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;input name=\"query\" type=\"text\" value=\"Find Weather\" onfocus=\"this.value=\'\'\" style=\"width: 85px;\"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=\"padding-top: 5px;\"&gt;&lt;input name=\"GO\" type=\"submit\" value=\"GO\" style=\"width: 50px; background-color: #008; color: #FFF; font-size: 12px; font-weight: bold; border-top: 1px solid #CCC; border-left: 1px solid #CCC; border-right: 1px solid #000; border-bottom: 1px solid #000;\"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/form&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td style=\"vertical-align: top;\"&gt;&lt;div style=\"height: 139px;\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://www.wunderground.com/US/CA/South_Lake_Tahoe.html?bannertypeclick=htmlSticker\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"http://banners.wunderground.com/weathersticker/htmlSticker2_cond/language/www/US/CA/South_Lake_Tahoe.gif\" alt=\"\" height=\"139\" width=\"170\" style=\"border: 0px;\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;!-- End WxSticker --&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_8\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;When To Climb Mount Tallac&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;div align=\"center\" class=\"image-right\" style=\"width: 156px;\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view-of-tallac-from-the-ne-on/139674\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"View of Tallac from the NE on...\" height=\"200\" width=\"150\" src=\"/images/small/139674.JPG\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=\"caption\"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;Mount Tallac can be climbed year round. I think the best time to climb and hike in the Lake Tahoe area is late July to late October. But late July (in normal years) most of the snow is melted out and Mosquitoes have cleared out for the most part. During the summer months temperatures rarely get about 80&deg; F or drop below 40&deg; F at night. By November the weather changes dramatically with high temperatures around 47&deg; F and lows about 22&deg; F. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Usually the heavy snows start in November. Highways 89 and 50 generally stay opened, only closed during strong snowstorms. But secondary roads that lead up to the trailheads close shortly after the snow starts.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div align=\"center\" class=\"image-right\" style=\"width: 206px;\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"/climbing-up-towards-mt/5886\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Climbing up towards Mt....\" height=\"150\" width=\"200\" src=\"/images/small/5886.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=\"caption\"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_9\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Recommended Equipment for Mount Tallac&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_10\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h3&gt;For a Summer Trip I Recommend the Follow Equipment&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&middot;	Map &amp;amp; Compass &lt;br&gt;&middot;	Knife &lt;br&gt;&middot;	Matches/Lighter &lt;br&gt;&middot;	Sunglasses &lt;br&gt;&middot;	Sunscreen and Lip Balm  &lt;br&gt;&middot;	First Aid Kit &lt;br&gt;&middot;	Food (extra food for emergencies) &lt;br&gt;&middot;	Headlamp and extra batteries &lt;br&gt;&middot;	Signaling Device (whistle and/or mirror) &lt;br&gt;&middot;	Gloves and Mittens &lt;br&gt;&middot;	Beanie, Sun Hat &lt;br&gt;&middot;	Wool or Synthetic Clothing&lt;br&gt;&middot;	Sleeping Bag - comfortable to 30F or 10F (in Winter)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_11\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h3&gt;For Winter I Recommend The Above Equipment Plus the Follow Equipment&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;div align=\"center\" class=\"image-left\" style=\"width: 206px;\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"/snowboarding-above-lake-tahoe/34313\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Snowboarding above Lake Tahoe...\" height=\"138\" width=\"200\" src=\"/images/small/34313.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=\"caption\"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&middot;	Down or Synthetic Parka &lt;br&gt;&middot;	Ice Axe &lt;br&gt;&middot;	Helmet &lt;br&gt;&middot;	Boots &lt;br&gt;&middot;	Gaiters &lt;br&gt;&middot;	Crampons &lt;br&gt;&middot;	Down Parka, Pants, and Mittens &lt;br&gt;&middot;	Double Boots or Over Boots &lt;br&gt;&middot;	Avalanche Beacon &amp;amp; Probe &lt;br&gt;&middot;	Snow Shovel &lt;br&gt;&middot;	Snowshoes or Skis&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_12\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Backcountry Skiing&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;div align=\"center\" class=\"image-right\" style=\"width: 506px;\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"/mount-tallac-seen-from/34322\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Mount Tallac seen from...\" height=\"388\" width=\"500\" src=\"/images/medium/34322.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=\"caption\"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;Readers of Couloir Magazine rate Tallac one of the \"top 10\" backcountry skiing destinations in the US (#9 to be exact).   This is a justifiably popular skiing destination with a little something for everyone, so don\'t expect to have the mountain to yourself.  &lt;p&gt;  The most popular ski routes on Mt. Tallac are on the NE and SE faces of the mountain.  The NE bowl is the trade route and sees probably 90% of the traffic on any given winter day.  As a result, get there early on weekends and powder days if you want to get a parking space on Spring Creek and/or first tracks down the bowl.  The SE ramp of Tallac provides good spring corn descents, while the east face routes -- including \"the cross\" couloir -- are for the extreme crowd.  Finally, if long distance touring is your game, the Tallac-Dicks ridge is a great linkup with stuff in the central desolation wilderness. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Below is an overview of some of the main bc skiing routes on Mt. Tallac:  &lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div align=\"center\" class=\"image-left\" style=\"width: 206px;\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"/skiing-the-mellow-powder/34325\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Skiing the mellow powder...\" height=\"140\" width=\"200\" src=\"/images/small/34325.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=\"caption\"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt; 1) &lt;u&gt;NE Bowl&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This popular route is well described on Mpbro\'s page &lt;a href=\"http://www.summitpost.com/mountains/route_link.pl/route_id/377/object_id/289\"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.  Expert skiers can find variations on the standard NE Bowl theme by turning off to the right at various points on the descent, leading to (i) the east face chutes; (ii) the cross \"right arm\"; or (iii) the so-called \"front chutes\".  These are described in more detail on the east face ski descents page.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;2) &lt;u&gt;SE Ramp&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The SE ramp and its broad chutes are another good option for winter downhill fun.  This route is better late season or after a warmer spell when the snow has consolidated and corned up a bit.  Also, given the southerly exposure, this side tends to stablize more quickly after a dump.  If you ski this side of the peak, you probably will still start your tour at the Spring Creek trailhead (at the bottom of the NE Bowl route).  Thus, if you remember one thing, it is to be sure to traverse back towards your starting point before getting too low, or you will face a routefinding penalty and be forced to slog out of the Fallen Leaf Lake drainage.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;3) &lt;u&gt;East Face Routes&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;The direct east face of Mount Tallac provides hair raising descents for the more accomplished skiers and riders.  The most notable line is \"the cross\" couloir, which drops down the east face from a point just south of the summit.  This line is tough to miss when standing atop the SE ramp, or from anywhere in South Lake Tahoe for that matter, as it is the most prominent feature on the mountain.  Other descent options on the east side &lt;div align=\"center\" class=\"image\" style=\"width: 392px;\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"/mount-tallac-topo/594960\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Mount Tallac Topo\" height=\"500\" width=\"386\" src=\"/images/medium/594960.jpeg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=\"caption\"&gt;Mount Tallac Topo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;of the peak are the east face chutes and the front chutes.  These are described in more detail on the east face ski descents page.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_13\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Etymology&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;i&gt;\"Tallac, Mount [El Dorado]. The mountain is shown as Crystal Peak on the maps of the Whitney Survey, but the Wheeler Survey in 1877 applied the Indian name, which means simply \"large mountain\". According to Kirchkoff (p. 278) Tallac for for many years a famous resort after \"Lucky\" Baldwin built his hotel, The Tallac House, at the lake shore about 1875\"&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Erwin G.

Thus in 1844, when John C. Fremont&rsquo;s party first saw Lake Tahoe, they asked a Washo Indian what it was called, and the Indian said, d&aacute;&rsquo;aw &lsquo;a lake&rsquo;; this was written down in English as &ldquo;Tahoe.&rdquo; In 1877, in the same area, the Wheeler surveying party asked another Washo to identify a California mountain, and the Indian said dal&aacute;&rsquo;ak  &lsquo;a mountain&rsquo;; this became Mount Tallac\"&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;William Bright, Native American Place Names Of The United States&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_14\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Additional Mount Tallac Information&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_15\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Maps&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&middot;	USGS 7 &frac12;-minute &lt;i&gt;

It is truly awe-inspiring: rising 9,000 ft from the Owens Valley, it commands ones attention from great distances, overshadowing &amp;amp; overpowering everything surrounding it. Its incredible bulk is matched only by its complexity- steep facesare framed by seemingly never-ending, sinuous aretes; countless gullies &amp;amp; couloirs separate enormous buttresses; spires tower above the onlooker...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In addition to the true summit, the East (14,125\') &amp;amp; West Horns (14,160\'), the massif\'s subpeaks, intimidate the would-be climber; while diminutive when viewed from the summit, the opposite is the case when one is separated from the summit plateau by them! Precipitous drops beckon one (or not!) to the voids surrounding them, the sense of exposure enough to make the most seasoned of mountaineers balk. The scene is reminiscent of the Lord of the Rings. Traversing from the summit of the East Horn across the West Horn to the summit plateau requires 5th class climbing (or rappelling; it should be noted that even if rappelling, however, comfort with 5th class terrain should be mandatory here).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The most common way to climb Williamson is via the standard Class 3 West Face route. The climb itself is not overly difficult, but getting to the base of the climb is a different matter altogether. The most common approach involves an 11 mile hike to 12,040&rsquo; Shepherd Pass, followed by an arduous traverse of the glacially carved Williamson Bowl. The Williamson Bowl area may look fairly flat on your topo, but it has lots of small ups and downs. You have to weave around lakes and climb up and over many large boulder-strewn hills just to get to the base of the route.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It is important to note that hiking the trail to Shepherd Pass (12,040 ft) is not a casual outing! The trailhead is only at 6,299 ft! In addition, the people who built the trail must have been on crack because parts of it have switchbacks that gain about 3 ft in 100 yds, and at one point it descends almost 1000 ft when it should be going up!&lt;br&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_2\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Getting There&lt;/h2&gt;SHEPHERD\'S PASS TRAILHEAD (standard approach):From Independence, head west on Market Street for 4.2 miles. Turn left on Foothill Road, which is a gravel road. After driving on Foothill drive for 2.7 miles, you will pass a sign with a hiker symbol on the right and a &ldquo;Symmes Creek&rdquo; sign in the center. Keep left and continue for another 0.5 mile. Then, turn right at the intersection where the sign says &ldquo;Shepherd Pass Trailhead.&rdquo; Drive another 1.4 miles along a rough gravel road (but still passable with a low-clearance 2wd vehicle) until reaching the trailhead. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;According to &lt;a href=\"http://www.summitpost.org/cgi-bin/user_link.pl?user_id=1657\"&gt;Charles Altman&lt;/a&gt; (using GPS), the distance, from the trailhead, to: &lt;br&gt;* Anvil Camp = 8 1/4 miles&lt;br&gt;* Shepherd Pass = 10.3 miles&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;table class=\"inline_image_thumbs\"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=5912\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/5912.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=5915\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/5915.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=5913\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/5913.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=5914\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/5914.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=79054\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/79054.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;'),(26,150440,'/mount-humphreys/150440','/john-muir-wilderness/170988','Mount Humphreys','','','','13986','',62158,37.2706,-118.673,'California, United States, North America','','',170988,'John Muir Wilderness','','','','','','Mountain-Rock','content: &lt;article&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_1\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2 id=\"first_h2\"&gt;Overview&lt;/h2&gt;Mt. Humphreys is an outstanding Sierra peak having no easy route to the summit. Standing just shy of 14,000ft in elevation, it so dominates its surroundings that it is one of the 15 Sierra Emblem Peaks so designated by the Sierra Club. No other Sierra peak to the north rises higher, and there are expansive views from the summit. From Bishop, much of the mountain is hidden from view by &lt;a href=\"http:/mountains/mountain_link.pl/mountain_id/1392\"&gt;Mt. Tom&lt;/a&gt; in the foreground, with only its jagged summit visible. From the west and especially in Humphreys Basin, the mountain rises in such an impressive fashion as to demand one\'s gaze and attention. It was from this western vantage that it was first viewed by Joseph LeConte who made the first attempt on the peak in 1898. He failed, and it was six more years before Edward and James Hutchinson were to make the first ascent.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The easiest ascent, class 4 is from the western side, but there is much loose talus to be climbed first. There is a small glacier under its Northeast Face, and there are excellent ice/snow climbs be found on this face as well. Climbing Humphreys you will likely find yourself alone on the mountain and gazing out at an incredible view. Any route on Humphreys is a quality route and well worth the climb.&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;table class=\"inline_image_thumbs\"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=47709\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/47709.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=28273\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/28273.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=28332\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/28332.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=37018\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/37018.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=29061\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/29061.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_2\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Getting There&lt;/h2&gt;The usual approach is from the east over Piute Pass and on into Humphreys Basin to the west of the peak, a full day\'s hike if carrying a pack. SR168 out of Bishop leads to the beautiful lake basins above where you take the road to North Lake and the Piute Pass TH. Approachs from the west are often long multi-day hikes. There is a quick alternative approach via morrainal ridges just north of McGee Creek. This is accessed via Buttermilk Road off of SR168 and continuing on via unmarked roads until you come to a recently burned area and park at a cattle guard. Hike up and over the ridges you see to the west or continue on the dirt road to McGee Creek and follow it up. &lt;b&gt;This alternative is best in winter.&lt;/b&gt; In summer use the McGee Creek TH.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;From &lt;a href=\"http:/mountains/user_link.pl/user_id/4920\"&gt;asmrz&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;br&gt;Corrections to Buttermilk Road Description on page 301 of RJ Secor&rsquo;s Second Edition: &lt;br&gt;Presently Buttermilk Road has no street sign.

The 1982 Mt.Tom 7.5 minute map has the aqueduct drawn on it. The McGee Creek trail starts at this pipe. A high-clearance vehicle is definitely required, and in the worst of conditions, a four wheel drive will be necessary. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=\"http:/mountains/user_link.pl?user_id=5493\"&gt;Craig Peer&lt;/a&gt; adds:&lt;br&gt;If going to the McGee Creek trailhead for Humphreys or Checkered Demon I prefer the Dutch Johns Meadow Branch which starts behind the old wilderness permit kiosk a few minutes up 168 from Starlight Road. The topo map actually shows this road fairly accurately too. I then come out the other way you describe for the total scenic loop. From the kiosk, follow road 7S15 for about 4 miles and bear right at a fork onto 7S01. In about 2.2 miles you\'ll come to a clearing - bear left. Follow this for about 1 mile to another clearing and a three-way intersection. The route to the right ends at the aqueduct pipe described above. The center route dead-ends in a quarter mile. Take the left branch to the end in another 1/2 mile, park here.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;table class=\"inline_image_thumbs\"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=147229\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/147229.JPG\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_3\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Red Tape&lt;/h2&gt;Everything you need to know about permits and regulations can be found on the &lt;a href=\"http://www.summitpost.org/show/mountain_link.pl/mountain_id/4859\"&gt;Eastern Sierra - Logisitcal Center&lt;/a&gt; page.&lt;br&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_4\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;When To Climb&lt;/h2&gt;Most climbing activity occurs in the summer months of June-August.

As with most of the lakes in the basin, it is desolate with little vegetation, and exposed to the intense summer rays. Still, it provides probably the easiest jumping off point to tackle Mt. Humphreys, whose Southwest Face looms high above, only a short walk away. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;One caveat for those travelling to Humphreys Basin: the fishing is poor. With little vegetation, there is little biomatter to support an ecosystem here, and the fish remain small and few.&lt;br&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_6\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Etymology&lt;/h2&gt;\"Andrew Atkinson Humphreys (1810-1883), soldier and engineer, the grandson of Joshua Humphreys, who designed the \'Constitution\' and other frigates of the War of 1812.

It is one mass of cracked and broken blocks, thrown loosely together in such a way as to warn one to move cautiously lest the whole top should break off and fall into the great abyss to the eastward. ... Probably no one has ever stood where we then were, unless perhaps during the early Jurassic period, before the mountain was fully sculptured. Then the mariners of that age (if there were any) might have sailed upon the waters of the Pacific close to the base of the mountain, and, there landing, have climbed up its then gently sloping sides.\' (SCB 5, no. 3, Jan. 1905: 171-72.) &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Humphreys Lakes were first named on the Mt. Tom 15\' quad, 1949.\" &lt;br&gt;- &lt;b&gt;Peter Browning, &lt;i&gt;Place Names of the Sierra Nevada&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Clarence King, a member of the Whitney Survey under William Brewer, was later (1867) named U. S. Geologist in charge of the Geological Exploration of the Fortieth Parrallel under Brigadier General A. A. Humphreys, the U. S. Chief of Engineers. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\"[Joseph N.] LeConte\'s first significant mountaineering venture outside his familiar haunts came in 1898, when he and Clarence Cory decided to explore the possibility of a true high mountain route between Yosemite and Kings Canyon. During the early part of their month-long journey, the two men closely followed the pioneering route of their predecessor, Theodore Solomons, even to the extent of visiting the upper reaches of Mono Creek. From a camp near the junction off this stream and the Second Recess, the pair made the first ascent of Red Slate Mountain, the towering sentinel of this part of the Sierra. A few days later, from the top of Seven Gables, they were awestruck by the sight of unclimbed Mount Humphreys, a solitary monolith nine miles to the east. At that moment the men resolved to try for its tapered summit. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;LeConte and Cory attempted to lead their pack animals toward the huge peak, but, finding no practical route, they returned to Blaney Meadows, a lush parkland on the South Fork of the San Joaquin River. Leaving their stock behind, the pair knapsacked into Humphreys Basin, a wild and austere region dotted with dozens of rockbound lakes. On July 7 they made their bid for the summit. After several false starts on various ridges, the men finally reached a small prominence on the mountain\'s northwest ridge, 500 feet below the top. The view upward was discouraging, as evidenced by LeConte\'s later description: \"I have never felt so impressed, so utterly overpowered, by the presence of a great mountain as when standing amongst the crags of Mt. Humphreys looking up that smooth wall to its airy summit, and again down ten thousand feet into the depths of the Owen\'s Valley.\" So intimidated were the two men that they fled down the mountainside without even attempting the summit pinnacle. The immense landmark of the central Sierra would remain unascended for several more years.\" &lt;br&gt;- &lt;b&gt;Steve Roper, &lt;i&gt;Sierra High Route&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;James Hutchinson, pleased with his ascents in the Palisades the previous year, was also active during the summer of 1904. The San Francisco attorney was the preeminent climber of the Sierra during the early years of this century, complementing his friend LeConte, who was unquestionably the range\'s most prominent explorer, mapmaker, and photographer. With his brother Edward and two other men, Hutchinson entered the mountains in mid-July with a bold goal: the ascent of the still unclimbed Mount Humphreys. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;At Blaney Meadows the group encountered Gilbert and LeConte, the latter welcoming his Bay Area Friends and begging to hear the news from home. \"All the afternoon,\" LeConte wrote in his diary, \"I talked with my friends, and smoked their cigars and drank their benedictine.\" The two parties traveled together as far as Colby Meadow, that exquisite spot at the head of Evolution Valley. (Readers familiar with Sierra geography may wonder why Hutchinson ignored Piute Creek, a far more direct route to Mount Humphreys. Lacking lightweight food and equipment, early travelers depended greatly on pack animals to transport their necessities; Piute Creek, extremely rugged in its lower reaches, was not feasible for stock.) &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Leaving LeConte and Gilbert to their explorations of the Goddard Divide, Hutchinson\'s group ascended a faint sheep path leading up the north wall of Evolution Valley. Soon they arrived at a superb campsite, a lake \"fringed with the exquisite alpine heather,\" as Hutchinson later wrote. In the background loomed a multitude of unclimbed peaks; closer at hand the men were amused by the antics of dozens of gray-crowned rosy finches, those hyperactive denizens of the subalpine zone. The beautiful lake, situated on a high bench overlooking Evolution Valley, was named Lake Frances, after one man\'s wife. It was to lose this name in later years, appearing on the map simply as Lake 11,106. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A reconnaissance by two of the men to the top of nearby Glacier Divide -- which they would have to cross to reach Mount Humphreys -- provided a dramatic view of their goal, only four miles to the north. But the forground terrain worried the men, for steep cliffs and ominous couloirs on the north side of the ridge looked difficult for humans and certainly impassable for stock. On the following day, having tethered their mules to shrubs along the shoreline of Lake Frances, the men were able, with only a few moments of apprehension, to cross the divide at what immediately was dubbed Snow-Tongue Pass. Four tired mountaineers set up camp that night in desolate Humphreys Basin. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;At dawn on July 18 the quartet set off toward one of the range\'s most spectacular summits. Wary of facing the difficulties of the route attempted by LeConte and Cory, Hutchinson led his team up a different side of the mountain. Sheer cliffs blocked the upper part of this route also, but the confident Hutchinson made a courageous -- or perhaps foolhardly -- effort and succeeded in surmounting a frightfully exposed wall [a 5.4 climb, no easy effort]. Edward Hutchinson managed to struggle up a rope cast down by his brother, but their companions demurred, contenting themselves with the ascent of a nearby pile of rocks they facetiously named Married Men\'s Point. A few minutes later, at precisely the moment LeConte strode alone onto the barren saddle of Muir Pass, the Hutchinson brothers clambered onto the exposed summit rocks of 13,986-foot Mount Humphreys. Another Sierra giant had fallen. &lt;br&gt;- &lt;b&gt;Steve Roper, &lt;i&gt;Sierra High Route&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\"Andrew A. Humphreys was not a magnetic leader. He had none of the charisma of Maj. Gen. Dan Sickles, his corps commander. As he led his division onto the field at Gettysburg on July 2, the men had no affection for him. He was called \'Old Goggle Eyes\' because of his reading spectacles, and at the age of fifty-three, they considered him an old man, though he was tall and slim and not yet gray. He was new to his division, and his men knew him only as a strict disciplinarian, exacting and precise, an unfeeling, bow-legged tyrant. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It was true that Humphreys was one of the most demanding officers in the army. When he advanced into a fight, he left no one behind. At the Battle of Fredericksburg, one colonel had detached six of his youngest, frailest soldiers to stay behind and guard the regiment\'s knapsacks, but Humphreys, swearing mightily, ordered them back into line with the rest. Two were killed. Charles Anderson Dana, the Assistant Secretary of War, thought him \'one of the loudest swearers\' he had ever known, a man of \'distinguished and brilliant profanity,\' much like the Second Corps\'s Maj. Gen. Winfield Hancock. But Dana also found Humphreys to be charming, a man completely without vanity in a profession swarming with prima donnas. Theodore Lyman of Meade\'s staff, who served under Humphreys later in the war, described him as a nice old gentleman who was boyish, with quick peppery ways, and extremely neat, \'continually washing himself and putting on paper dickeys.\' Another of his peers considered him \'eminent both as a scientist and a soldier, a man of broad and liberal views, of commanding intellect, and of the highest personal honor.\' Humphreys liked long conversations with his staff after meals and had knowledge of many things. He regarded the military profession as a \'godlike occupation,\' and developed a positive fondness for battle, once observing that war was a \'very bad thing in the sequel, but before and during a battle it is a damn fine thing!\' The division\'s provost marshal recollected Humphreys as \'without a superior on the field of battle--full of fire, and yet in absolute equipoise.\' Brig. Gen. Joseph Carr commented on the general\'s \'conspicuous courage and remarkable coolness.\' &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Humphreys was not gifted with the ability to inspire, so instead he led his men personally into battle, putting himself up front, writing later that \'for certain good reasons connected with the effect of what I did upon the spirit of the men and from an invincible repugnance to ride anywhere else, I always rode at the head of my troops.\' Lt. Cavada of the general\'s staff recalled that just before he took his troops up to the Stone Wall at Fredericksburg, Humphreys had bowed to his staff in his courtly way, \'and in the blandest manner remarked, \'Young gentlemen, I intend to lead this assault; I presume, of course, you will wish to ride with me?\'\' Since it was put like that, the staff had done so, and five of the seven officers were knocked off their horses. After his men had taken as much as they could stand in front of the Stone Wall on Marye\'s Heights, the next brigade coming up the hill saw Humphreys sitting his horse all alone, looking out across the plain, bullets cutting the air all around him. Something about the way the general was taking it pleased them, and they sent up a cheer. Humphreys looked over, surprised, waved his cap to them with a grim smile, and then went riding off into the twilight. In this way Humphreys had turned his first division\'s dislike of him into admiration for his heroic leadership, and he would do the same with his new division at Gettysburg. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Humphreys was descended from the famed Humphreyses of Philadelphia, the distinguished naval architects who designed the USS Constitution and Constellation and many other ships of the Old Navy. Andrew graduated from West Point 13th out of 33 students in the class of 1831, and served in the artillery in the Seminole War. His interest shifted quickly to engineering, however, and by 1838 he was serving in the Corps of Topographical Engineers, conducting hydrographic surveys on the Mississippi River (like Generals Lee and Meade.) His Report on the Physics and Hydraulics of the Mississippi River was published the year the Civil War began, a contribution so valuable to the knowledge of the hydraulics of great rivers that it was translated into foreign languages and permanently established Humphreys\'s scientific reputation. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;At the outbreak of the War, Humphreys was a man with military training but little experience with troops in the field. His health had never been good, and illness prevented him from joining the army until late 1861, when he was appointed as chief engineer to Maj. Gen. George B. McClellan; he served on McClellan\'s staff during the Peninsula Campaign. Just before the Battle of Antietam he was given command of a new Fifth Corps division of nine-month men, which were held in reserve in that battle. It was three months later, at the Battle of Fredericksburg, that he and his division won fame for their valor, known for getting closest to the Stone Wall of any Union division before being driven back. \'He behaved with distinguished gallantry at Fredericksburg,\' New Fifth Corps commander Maj. Gen. George Meade wrote afterward. Meade sympathized with Humphreys--even after such a performance, Meade said, Humphreys was omitted from a long list for promotion \'including such names as. . . Sickles . . . who have really done nothing,\' probably as a result of Humphreys\'s long association with the discredited McClellan. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;After the Battle of Chancellorsville, where his division was not heavily engaged, many of his men, whose terms of service had expired, were too tired or disgusted to re-enlist. Nearly a division in all evaporated from the Fifth Corps, so on May 23, about five weeks before Gettysburg, Humphreys was transferred to a Third Corps division to replace Maj. Gen. Hiram Berry, who had been killed at Chancellorsville. Humphreys would be the only West Point-trained career soldier in his new corps; although Third Corps chief Sickles--himself a political general--might not have fully appreciated it, Humphreys was a valuable addition to his command. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In mid-1863, Humphreys, though unfamiliar with his new division, was developing into a fine field officer. Meade considered him a \'splendid man,\' and when Meade became commander of the Army of the Potomac three days before Gettysburg, he asked Humphreys to be his chief of staff. Humphreys refused, not wanting to give up combat duty for a desk job.\" &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;- &lt;b&gt;&lt;a href=\"//www.rocemabra.com/roger/tagg/generals/\"&gt;Gettysburg: The Leaders of America\'s Greatest Battle&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_7\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;External Links&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://www.hikinglasvegas.com/panoramas/Humphreys1.html\"&gt;Panorama from Mt.

Tyndall sits right off of Shepherd\'s Pass, next to Mt. Williamson.  The mountain was named for the English glaciologist and mountaineer John Tyndall.  Most people try to climb both peaks together, as the approach via Sherpherd\'s Pass is one of the most difficult in California.  Mt. Tyndall is an easy mountain to summit from Shepherd\'s Pass by either the Class 2, Northwest Ridge or the more direct route straight up from the 2nd lake at Shepherd\'s Pass (Class 2+).  The summit affords excellent views.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Clarence King and Richard Cotter made the first ascent of Tyndall in 1864.  They were working on the Whitney Survey at the time and sighted Tyndall\'s mass from the summit of Mount Brewer.   They then set off on a five day expedition to conquer the summit.  King recounted their attempt in , Mountaineering in the Sierra Nevada. He stated,   \"If nature had intended to secure the summit from all assailants, she could not have planned her defenses better; for the smooth, granite wall which rose above the snow slope continued, apparently quite round the peak and we looked in great anxiety to see if there was not one place where it might be climbed.\"&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Tyndall\'s East Face is similar to the East Face of Whitney.  The first major route fell to Fred Beckey in 1970, when he and Charlie Raymond made the first ascent of the East Gully (III 5.8).  In 1972,  Mike Heath and Bill Sumner ascended the East Chimney (IV 5.8).  Mount Tyndall is most often climbed by the Northwest Ridge route via Shepherd\'s Pass.&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;table class=\"inline_image_thumbs\"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=60645\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/60645.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=61806\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/61806.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=16466\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/16466.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=25567\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/25567.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=16450\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/16450.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_2\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Getting There&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;br&gt;Shepherd\'s Pass Trailhead - Highway 395 to Independence.

Williamson cannot be climbed after July 15th, most people tend to climb Mt. Tyndall in late June and early July.  By the middle of July, most of the snow is gone (obviously a heavy snow year would delay this a couple of weeks) and therefore if one wishes to climb with crampons and ice axe, I would recommend climbing in June.&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;table class=\"inline_image_thumbs\"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=59068\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/59068.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=59063\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/59063.JPG\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_5\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Camping&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;br&gt;The best place to camp is the 2nd lake at Shepherd\'s Pass, which is at the base of the most direct route to the summit of Mt.

Anvil seems to be especially nice because is about 2 miles from the top of the pass (2 miles in) and there are quite a few sites and a nice stream to get water from.  Also, the first lake at the pass is generally prefered because it offers some protection from the wind and it\'s really unnecessary to gain the extra 200+\' up to the next lake.  The 2nd lake was looking quite dry in late June so I wouldn\'t count on it being a reliable source for water later in the year.&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td valign=\"bottom\" style=\"padding-top: 6px;\" colspan=\"2\"&gt;&lt;span style=\"font-size: 9px; color: #888;\"&gt;Posted Jul 2, 2004 10:23 pm&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;table border=\"0\" width=\"775\" class=\"messages\"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td width=\"110\" align=\"left\" valign=\"top\" style=\"padding-top: 6px;\"&gt;&lt;a name=\"120493\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a class=\"dis_user_lnk\" href=\"/users/bob-burd/276\"&gt;Bob Burd&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td valign=\"top\" style=\"padding-top: 6px;\"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Untitled Comment&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td align=\"right\" valign=\"top\" nowrap style=\"font-size: 10px;\"&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td valign=\"top\" rowspan=\"2\" align=\"left\" style=\"padding-top: 6px;\"&gt;&lt;p class=\"disc_avatar\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"/users/bob-burd/276\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Bob Burd\" width=\"50\" height=\"50\" border=\"0\" src=\"/images/avatars/1177.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=\"font-size: 9px; color: #888;\"&gt;Voted 10/10&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td colspan=\"2\" style=\"padding-top: 6px;\"&gt;&lt;i&gt;The 2nd lake was looking quite dry in late June &lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r&lt;br&gt;That wasn\'t my impression.

It is part of a twin peak with &lt;a href=\"http://www.summitpost.com/show/mountain_link.pl/mountain_id/2540\"&gt;Montgomery Peak&lt;/a&gt;. Montgomery Peak is 200 feet higher but is located in California. Boundary Peak derives its name from the proximity to the boundary between the two states that runs down the saddle between the two peaks and was likely named by surveyors who were working in the West in the mid 1800s. The actual boundary between the two states was finally legally settled in 1980. The controversy stemmed from a survey done in 1873 by Alexey VonSchmidt. His survey placed placed the border from Lake Tahoe to the Colorado River askew with that established by the U.S. Coast and Geodetic Survey between 1893 and 1899, putting Boundary Peak in California. If the USGS had not changed the border, &lt;a href=\"http://www.summitpost.com/mountains/mountain_link.pl/mountain_id/5\"&gt;Wheeler Peak &lt;/a&gt; in Great Basin National Park, would be Nevada\'s high point. Many still consider Wheeler a more spectacular peak, I\'ll leave that to you.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Most people who climb this peak are doing so trying to gain another in their quest to gain the high point in as many states as possible. The most climbed route, Trail Canyon, is a strenuous walk up through a tremendous amount of scree with some minor scrambling near the summit. &lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;table class=\"inline_image_thumbs\"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=31684\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/31684.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=8319\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/8319.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=1189\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/1189.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=8320\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/8320.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=11167\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/11167.JPG\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_2\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Getting There&lt;/h2&gt;No matter what direction one is coming from, you must get to Nevada Highway 264. About 200 yards south of the junction of Nevada Highway 264 and Nevada Highway 773 is a rough dirt road heading west. A 4-wheel drive is not required, but a high clearance vehicle is recommended, especially for the last mile or so. There are also a couple of small streams/washes to be crossed. Follow this road for approximately 14.7 miles to the trail head. At 2 miles continue straight at a cross road and again at 2.4 miles. At about 11 miles you will come upon the B &amp;amp; B Mine, here you will turn right and the quickly left. Going straight instead of the right will take you to a parking area, two rights take you to the mines buildings. At mile 12.1 there is another road junction but plainly signed. Proceed up the canyon which is a right hand turn. At about 13 miles you will pass a small reservoir and possibly some fishermen. Here the road narrows and gets quite rough.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Some people do use the Queen Canyon Road off U.S. Highway 6 just east of the California - Nevada border. It is a very rough road but passable to the Queen Mine at 9200 feet.&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;table class=\"inline_image_thumbs\"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=20365\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/20365.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=135390\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/135390.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_3\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Red Tape&lt;/h2&gt;There are no wilderness permits required for passage into or camping in the Boundary Peak Wilderness. There is a sign-in / sign-out log in a wood box on a post at the trailhead. If you plan on camping, a campfire permit is required.

Some have camped at the trail head. One can also camp up in Trail Canyon, but there are very few level places to place a tent.. Be sure to bring plenty of water as this is a desert. The only water is a small stream with a spring up Trail Canyon but there are also alot of cows grazing, drinking the water and doing their thing in it, so be sure to treat any water from this spring / stream.&lt;br&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_6\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Mountain Conditions&lt;/h2&gt;For current conditions call the White Mountain Ranger District Office at (760) 873 - 2500&lt;br&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_7\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Ancient Bristlecone Pines&lt;/h2&gt;There is a nice bristlecone pine forest on the northslopes of the East Ridge of Boundary Peak maybe a mile southwest of the trailhead.

If you continue on the left hand trail you work your way into a narrow canyon and find that the trail more or less peters out.

Only ran into one other person who summited and a few others who got lost and were looking for the trail up. For anyone reading this who hasn\'t done this peak, when you make your way up the gulch you want to aim at the low saddle on the right. Myself and the other climbers that day spent a good portion of the way back trying to find the correct trail for the ascent but had little luck. Basically when you get out of the hedges and your about to enter the sage brush (I built a rock pile at this location), turn right and follow the creek bed to the saddle. When you get close the saddle there will be a faint trail on the left hand slope, marked by little pieces of ribbons. Take the left slope and traverse to the saddle (you will find the left slope has much firmer ground than the right). Once you reach the saddle your golden, there is a pretty obvious trail that heads off to the left and follows the ridge line to the summit. On the way back you can shortcut the descent by taking the saddle over the drainage that flows into the sage brush field (a word of caution, this can be a little hard on the ankles since the slope is so loose).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Hope this helps.&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td valign=\"bottom\" style=\"padding-top: 6px;\" colspan=\"2\"&gt;&lt;span style=\"font-size: 9px; color: #888;\"&gt;Posted Aug 5, 2008 8:26 pm&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;table border=\"0\" width=\"775\" class=\"messages\"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td width=\"110\" align=\"left\" valign=\"top\" style=\"padding-top: 6px;\"&gt;&lt;a name=\"382953\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a class=\"dis_user_lnk\" href=\"/users/moogie737/22269\"&gt;Moogie737&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td valign=\"top\" style=\"padding-top: 6px;\"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Road between Queen Canyon mine TH and the \"real\" TH&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td align=\"right\" valign=\"top\" nowrap style=\"font-size: 10px;\"&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td valign=\"top\" rowspan=\"2\" align=\"left\" style=\"padding-top: 6px;\"&gt;&lt;p class=\"disc_avatar\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"/users/moogie737/22269\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Moogie737\" width=\"50\" height=\"50\" border=\"0\" src=\"/images/avatars/188943.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=\"font-size: 9px; color: #888;\"&gt;Hasn\'t voted&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td colspan=\"2\" style=\"padding-top: 6px;\"&gt;As of 6-25-10 the road up to the \"real\" TH is much improved over what it was before.

The road from Hwy 6 to the Queen Mine has deteriorated a little over the last few years and would be more difficult with a low-clearance passenger car, but could be done with very careful and slow driving (someone made it in a fairly low clearance vehicle while I was out there but I wouldn\'t have wanted to be driving that vehicle). The road from Queen Mine to Kennedy Saddle (Also known as Queen Mine Saddle) is in better shape than it was a few years ago when I last drove it and easy to drive in a stock Toyota Tacoma with 4WD. It might be do-able with high-clearance 2WD except that one tight turn might create a bit of a problem trying to get going again or backing up to negotiate the turn. So, if you have a truck with 4WD keep on driving up to the saddle and save yourself the extra walking.&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td valign=\"bottom\" style=\"padding-top: 6px;\" colspan=\"2\"&gt;&lt;span style=\"font-size: 9px; color: #888;\"&gt;Posted Sep 3, 2012 9:08 pm&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;table border=\"0\" width=\"775\" class=\"messages\"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td width=\"110\" align=\"left\" valign=\"top\" style=\"padding-top: 6px;\"&gt;&lt;a name=\"474046\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a class=\"dis_user_lnk\" href=\"/users/bscott/73237\"&gt;bscott&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td valign=\"top\" style=\"padding-top: 6px;\"&gt;&lt;b&gt;road conditions to queen mine&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td align=\"right\" valign=\"top\" nowrap style=\"font-size: 10px;\"&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td valign=\"top\" rowspan=\"2\" align=\"left\" style=\"padding-top: 6px;\"&gt;&lt;p class=\"disc_avatar\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"/users/bscott/73237\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"bscott\" width=\"50\" height=\"50\" border=\"0\" src=\"/images/avatars/923074.jpeg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=\"font-size: 9px; color: #888;\"&gt;Hasn\'t voted&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td colspan=\"2\" style=\"padding-top: 6px;\"&gt;drove the road on 8/10/13. the lower end (the part to queen mine) is in pretty good shape; in fact, someone in our party made it to the mine in a toyota camry! the road beyond that was very loose scree, and a two wheel drive high clearance toyota truck could not maintain traction on the road and eventually had to go back down.&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td valign=\"bottom\" style=\"padding-top: 6px;\" colspan=\"2\"&gt;&lt;span style=\"font-size: 9px; color: #888;\"&gt;Posted Aug 13, 2013 4:07 pm&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;table border=\"0\" width=\"745\" class=\"messages\" style=\"margin-left: 30px;\"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td rowspan=\"4\" valign=\"top\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/styles/layout/reply_arrow.gif\"&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td width=\"110\" align=\"left\" valign=\"top\" style=\"padding-top: 6px;\"&gt;&lt;a name=\"474780\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a class=\"dis_user_lnk\" href=\"/users/bruce-christensen/34441\"&gt;Bruce Christensen&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td valign=\"top\" style=\"padding-top: 6px;\"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Re: road conditions to queen mine&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td align=\"right\" valign=\"top\" nowrap style=\"font-size: 10px;\"&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td valign=\"top\" rowspan=\"2\" align=\"left\" style=\"padding-top: 6px;\"&gt;&lt;p class=\"disc_avatar\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"/users/bruce-christensen/34441\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Bruce Christensen\" width=\"50\" height=\"50\" border=\"0\" src=\"/images/avatars/369408.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=\"font-size: 9px; color: #888;\"&gt;Hasn\'t voted&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td colspan=\"2\" style=\"padding-top: 6px;\"&gt;We drove (well, tried to drive) the road from US 6 to Queen Mine on 23 Aug 2013 in a Hyundai Elantra passenger car.

Hike was awesome, started at 230am with a full moon, light wind and about 10 degrees. Trail had about 5-6 inches of snow. Don\'t be fooled, the hike only gets harder as you keep going. The last 0.5 mile is nothing but large boulders covered in black ice, very tricky. It was very difficult to get around them and find the route to the summit. Scree was not bad at all, I am thinking probably because it was frozen in place. Had a great time and would rate the hike as intermediate.

It is a prominent peak on the eastern boundary of Yosemite National Park, whose vertical southwest wall (one of the best spots for big wall climbing in the Tuolumne Meadows area) is visible from many points on Tioga Pass Road (Hwy-120). On the Sierra Nevada crestline, Mount Conness is the first high ridge at the head of the vast and low Tuolumne basin, a position that bears the brunt of winter snow storms. Hence it has the second largest glacier in Yosemite after &lt;a href=\"http://summitpost.com/mountains/mountain_link.pl/mountain_id/358\"&gt;Mount Lyell&lt;/a&gt;, and the entire area retains much snow for most of the summer. Northeast of Mount Conness is the enchanting Twenty Lakes Basin fed by its glacier. Accessed by the high trailhead of Saddlebag Lake (10060 feet), the basin is popular for fishing, and allows short, easy approaches to the Conness crest peaks.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The summit of Mount Conness is class 2 from Young Lakes on the west side (easiest route), which requires a long approach from &lt;a href=\"http://summitpost.com/mountains/mountain_link.pl/mountain_id/759\"&gt;Tuolumne Meadows&lt;/a&gt; trailhead in Yosemite National Park. The east side approach is shorter but a bit more difficult. Mount Conness offers challenging technical rock routes on its north ridge and southwest wall. Nearby &lt;a href=\"http://www.summitpost.com/mountains/mountain_link.pl?mountain_id=495\"&gt;North Peak&lt;/a&gt; has two steep couloirs popular for ice-climbing. For those interested in less technical scrambles, Mount Conness crest area is paradise. The relatively gentle terrain, clean granite and lack of vegetation make for many thrilling off-trail routes. In winter and spring, the abundant snow cover on the gentle Mount Conness crest make for ideal skiing conditions; the area south to Tioga Pass is especially popular.&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;table class=\"inline_image_thumbs\"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=24489\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/24489.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=24600\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/24600.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=24595\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/24595.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=29432\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/29432.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=49664\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/49664.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_2\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Getting There&lt;/h2&gt;Eastside trailhead: Saddlebag Lake, elevation 10060 ft. Take California Highway 120 (Tioga Pass Road)  to about 2 miles east of the east entrace of Yosemite National Park (Tioga Pass), turn to Saddlebag Lake Road on north side of highway, proceed to the end. There is a resort there at the lake. Saddlebag Lake Road is partly a dirt road but does not require high clearance vehicles. The shortest route from here to the summit of Conness is approx. 3.3 miles, elevation difference is 2600 feet.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Westside trailhead: &lt;a href=\"http://summitpost.com/mountains/mountain_link.pl/mountain_id/759\"&gt;Tuolumne Meadows&lt;/a&gt;., in Yosemite National Park about 8 miles west of Tioga Pass, the east entrance to the park.

Camping is not allowed in Hall Natural Area, which encompasses an area roughly within 3 miles of the crest on the east side, including areas around Alpine Lake, Conness Lakes, and Conness Glacier. If backcountry camping in Yosemite National Park or Hoover Wilderness, permits are required (see Red Tape section).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Roadside camping is generally prohibited in the area except in &lt;b&gt;fee campgrounds&lt;/b&gt; such as Saddlebag Lake and Sawmill campgrounds off Saddlebag Lake Road, or Tioga Lake, Ellery Lake, or Lee Vining Creek campgrounds along Highway 120 east of the park.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;You can also stay in &lt;b&gt;cabins&lt;/b&gt; in Yosemite National Park along Tioga Road, around &lt;a href=\"http://www.summitpost.com/mountains/mountain_link.pl/mountain_id/759\"&gt;Tuolumne Meadows&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;b&gt;Commercial lodging&lt;/b&gt; can be found at the Tioga Pass resort just outside Yosemite National Park, and in the towns of Lee Vining (closest), June Lake, or Mammoth Lakes (furthest).&lt;br&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_6\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;External Links&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://www.tahoebackcountry.net/features/skitioga02/\"&gt;Richard Steeleman\'s May 2002 ski tour&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://www.tahoebackcountry.net/features/conness/default.htm\"&gt;June 2002 climb/ski via the Glacier Route&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://www.snwburd.com/bob/trip_reports/white_n_1.html\"&gt;White &amp;amp; Conness - Aug 1, 1993&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://www.snwburd.com/bob/trip_reports/ragged_3.html\"&gt;Ragged/Conness/White dayhike - June 10, 2004&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://www.saracino.com/Summer2005/Conness/\"&gt;Mt Conness -- Photos of climb up the East Ridge via Alpine Lake, 8/17/2005&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;                                                               &lt;div align=\"center\"&gt;&lt;a name=\"messages\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_7\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Additions and Corrections&lt;/h2&gt;[ &lt;a href=\"/object_discussion.php?type=vote_comments&amp;amp;object_id=150473&amp;amp;is_addition=1#vote_form\"&gt;Post an Addition or Correction&lt;/a&gt; ]&lt;table cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" style=\"width: 775px;\"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;table cellpadding=\"2\" cellspacing=\"2\" width=\"100%\"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;&lt;span class=\"pagertext\"&gt;Viewing: &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;-&lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt; of &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td align=\"center\"&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td align=\"right\"&gt;    &lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;table border=\"0\" width=\"775\" class=\"messages\"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td width=\"110\" align=\"left\" valign=\"top\" style=\"padding-top: 6px;\"&gt;&lt;a name=\"120327\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a class=\"dis_user_lnk\" href=\"/users/chris-r/18272\"&gt;chris_r&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td valign=\"top\" style=\"padding-top: 6px;\"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Untitled Comment&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td align=\"right\" valign=\"top\" nowrap style=\"font-size: 10px;\"&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td valign=\"top\" rowspan=\"2\" align=\"left\" style=\"padding-top: 6px;\"&gt;&lt;p class=\"disc_avatar\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"/users/chris-r/18272\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"chris_r\" width=\"50\" height=\"50\" border=\"0\" src=\"/images/avatars/757170.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=\"font-size: 9px; color: #888;\"&gt;Hasn\'t voted&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td colspan=\"2\" style=\"padding-top: 6px;\"&gt;The fine and time honored S.W. face route (Harding) is beautiful.

Sawtooth Ridge is the northernmost group of Sierra peaks to exceed 12,000 feet elevation; its sharp relief contrasts dramatically with the generally rounded Sierra crestline to the north, thus Sawtooth Ridge is commonly considered the beginning of \"High Sierra\".&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The entire Sawtooth Ridge area is a paradise for technical rock climbing and ski mountaineering, having a short approach from the year-round Twin Lakes resort. Matterhorn Peak also has the distinction of being the mountain Jack Kerouac attempted to climb in a spiritual quest. His unsuccessful ascent of Matterhorn Peak was dramatized in his novel \"Dharma Bums\".&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Matterhorn Peak only resembles the original Matterhorn of Switzerland when viewed from below its north face. Matterhorn Peak has class 2 routes on its SW and SE slopes, yet its north side offers class 5 technical rock routes and steep snow couloirs. (Info by &lt;a href=\"http://summitpost.com/mountains/user_link.pl?user_id=254\"&gt;John&lt;/a&gt;) The classic ski descent of this peak is along the East Couloir. The West Couloir is also a possibility as is a route called Ski Dreams just a little east of the peak. &lt;a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1560449136/summitpost-20/002-0295754-0002443\"&gt;Moynier\'s Backcountry Skiing California\'s High Sierra&lt;/a&gt; has a 1 page description and 2 photos. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;table class=\"inline_image_thumbs\"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=15958\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/15958.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=31739\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/31739.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=31763\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/31763.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=2535\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/2535.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=2534\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/2534.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_2\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Getting There&lt;/h2&gt;The nearest trailhead to Matterhorn Peak is Twin Lakes, elevation 7000 feet. To get there take Twin Lakes Road off Highway 395 in the town of Bridgeport. At the end of 13 mile long Twin Lakes Road is the Mono Village resort, where there is a fee for overnight parking. From Mono Village the shortest route to the summit of Matterhorn is approx. 5 miles, elevation difference is 5280 feet (1 mile).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Several other trailheads require longer approaches than Twin Lakes trailhead, but you will also lose the crowds. South of Bridgeport on US-395 one can take the Green Lakes or Virginia Lakes trailhead, both of which have trails that lead into Virginia Canyon in Yosemite National Park. One must then cross the class 3 ridge between Virginia and Stanton Peaks in order to reach Spiller Canyon, which leads to the south side of Matterhorn Peak. The approach from Green Lakes is described in the &lt;a href=\"http://www.summitpost.com/mountains/mountain_link.pl/mountain_id/290\"&gt;Stanton Peak&lt;/a&gt; page. The &lt;a href=\"http://summitpost.com/mountains/mountain_link.pl/mountain_id/532\"&gt;Whorl Mountain&lt;/a&gt; page also describes the alternative approach route from Tuolumne Meadows in Yosemite national Park.&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;table class=\"inline_image_thumbs\"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=71685\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/71685.JPG\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=6114\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/6114.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=25019\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/25019.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=6110\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/6110.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=31926\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/31926.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_3\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Red Tape&lt;/h2&gt;The trailhead is privately owned by the Mono Village resort, which charges an overnight parking fee ($10 for up to 7 days as of March 2009).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If backcountry camping, a free permit is required for Hoover Wilderness (north of Horse Creek Pass) or Yosemite National Park. The ranger office for this part of Toiyabe National Forest is on Highway 395 1 mile south of Bridgeport. Maximum party size is 8 in the Sawtooth Ridge zone, including Horse Creek canyon. Since the permits are on a quota system from the last Friday in June through September 15, it can be difficult to obtain during popular summer weekends. Advance reservation of wilderness permits is a good idea (fee charged).&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;table class=\"inline_image_thumbs\"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=53040\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/53040.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=104710\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/104710.JPG\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=52767\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/52767.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_4\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;When To Climb&lt;/h2&gt;Although summer (June to September) offers the best weather for climbing, Matterhorn Peak is one of the most popular ski-mountaineering peaks in California.&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;table class=\"inline_image_thumbs\"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=31736\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/31736.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=19957\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/19957.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=24977\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/24977.JPG\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=17034\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/17034.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=27420\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/27420.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_5\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Camping&lt;/h2&gt;A free permit is required for &lt;b&gt;backcountry camping&lt;/b&gt;. See Red Tape section for the location of ranger office. No campfires are allowed. Bear boxes are required for food storage to deter black bears. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Roadside camping is generally prohibited except in the &lt;b&gt;fee campgrounds&lt;/b&gt; along Twin Lakes Road. There is a coin-operated &lt;b&gt;shower facility&lt;/b&gt; a short ways east of Twin Lakes. Near the Green Lakes and Virginia Lakes trailheads there are also fee campgrounds.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Commercial lodging&lt;/b&gt; can be found in the Mono Village resort at the Twin Lakes trailhead, or in the town of Bridgeport.&lt;br&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_6\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;External Links&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://www.stanford.edu/~holliman/hiking/matterhorn_100502/index_web.html\"&gt;October \'02 day hike&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://www.tahoebackcountry.net/features/matterhorn2003\"&gt;Ski Dreams Couloir on Matterhorn Peak, April 19, 2003&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;

It lies along the Sierra Crest, at the southeast end of one of the highest portions of the High Sierra encompassing the Palisade range, home to 6 other 14ers. Split Mtn can be easily recognized from US395 by the &lt;a href=\"http://www.summitpost.org/show/route_link.pl/route_id/549/object_id/357\"&gt;East Couloir&lt;/a&gt; that splits the twin summits. The north summit is the high point. It is also easily identified from the Big Pine area and highway 168 leading to Glacier Lodge.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The easiest route is via the class 2 North Slope and Red Lake on the east side. There are many other routes to the summit of varying technical difficulties. There are snow/ice routes on the east side in the East Couloir and &lt;a href=\"http://www.summitpost.org/st-jean-couloir/679529\"&gt;St. Jean Couloir&lt;/a&gt;. There are also extended arete routes that rival Temple Crag for the longest such climbs in the Sierra. The west side is a jumble of spires, aretes and gullies that make routes difficult to describe and impossible to follow. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Secor claims Split is the easiest 14er after Whitney, but that claim is hard to justify unless only considering Sierra peaks (White Mtn in the Inyos, 14 mi roundtrip on a dirt road is the easiest 14er) and further considering only technical difficulty (Mt. Muir, just off the Mt. Whitney Trail is far easier, but has a class 3 rating for the portion just below the summit). And Mt. Langley via Old Army Pass (or New Army Pass) and the SW Slope is also much easier than an ascent of Split Mtn.&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;table class=\"inline_image_thumbs\"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=15998\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/15998.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=1477\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/1477.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=15173\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/15173.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=129140\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/129140.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_2\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Getting There&lt;/h2&gt;This is the hard part. Of all the California 14ers, Split Mtn has the most difficult access, which may or may not require 4WD with good clearance, depending on road conditions and how much you care about the underside of your vehicle. There are two ways to reach the Red Lake Trailhead, the first being that most often used:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;From Big Pine on US395, head west on Glacier Lodge Rd, which heads to the Big Pine Creek Trailheads. Steve Eckert provides comprehensive directions from here at: &lt;a href=\"http://www.climber.org/DrivingDirections/redlake.html\"&gt;climber.org&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A second approach, purported to be shorter and easier (but I haven\'t actually tried),  is via the Tinemaha Campground several miles south of Big Pine.&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;Oct, 2002: I have seen at least two posts from folks attempting this route this summer, both giving it up as a waste of time and going the first route.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;Jul, 2003: &lt;a href=\"http://www.summitpost.com/mountains/user_link.pl/user_name/ScottyS\"&gt;ScottyS&lt;/a&gt; adds the following upon successfully negotiating the Tinemaha route in 2002:&lt;br&gt;Last year I successfully navigated the Tinemaha Campground route in a Subaru Legacy at night. I didn\'t even attempt the McMurray route.&lt;br&gt;Beta --- Basically, continue past the gravel plant (after Tinemaha) taking the north fork in the road along the edge of the hill. The road bends north around the hill and ends up in a gravel pit. After the curve and before the pit look for a light track turning left (west) through the sand to a fenceline about 100yds off the gravel road. Follow the track for about 1/2 mile along the fenceline (heading directly towards the mountains) until reaching the road from McMurray Meadows. Turn left (south) and proceed to the trailhead.

This is a great location that makes for an easy hike to the summit the following day, and the sunrises on Split Mtn can be grand. Be sure to follow rules for camping away from lakes and streams in the Wilderness, and follow proper disposal procedures for human and food waste. Bears are definitely in this area, so be sure to follow good food storage practices - use a bear canister if you have any doubts about your ability to keep food away from bears and marmots (also a hungry pack of these in the locale).&lt;br&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_6\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Etymology&lt;/h2&gt;\"\'To the north of this gap the crest rises into a huge mountain with a double summit ... which I called Split Mountain.\' (Bolton C.

However, in the interest of distance, if I was driving a high-clearance machine, I would still go for the \"fencline\" road.  Of course, the biggest question would still be \"is the Red Lake trail worth all of this?\"  Of course not ;-)&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td valign=\"bottom\" style=\"padding-top: 6px;\" colspan=\"2\"&gt;&lt;span style=\"font-size: 9px; color: #888;\"&gt;Posted Jul 21, 2004 1:28 pm&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;table border=\"0\" width=\"775\" class=\"messages\"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td width=\"110\" align=\"left\" valign=\"top\" style=\"padding-top: 6px;\"&gt;&lt;a name=\"37057\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a class=\"dis_user_lnk\" href=\"/users/matthew-holliman/10534\"&gt;Matthew Holliman&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td valign=\"top\" style=\"padding-top: 6px;\"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Untitled Comment&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td align=\"right\" valign=\"top\" nowrap style=\"font-size: 10px;\"&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td valign=\"top\" rowspan=\"2\" align=\"left\" style=\"padding-top: 6px;\"&gt;&lt;p class=\"disc_avatar\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"/users/matthew-holliman/10534\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Matthew Holliman\" width=\"50\" height=\"50\" border=\"0\" src=\"/images/avatars/14489.JPG\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=\"font-size: 9px; color: #888;\"&gt;Hasn\'t voted&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td colspan=\"2\" style=\"padding-top: 6px;\"&gt;Well, I took your directions, the ones from 395.com, and the ones from climber.org, and although all were accurate, I still failed.

I made it to the end of the mine road, headed down a couple of wrong options, walked around with my headlamp for a bit looking for the fence, before the absurdity of the situation hit me and I gave up.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r&lt;br&gt;Although the road is rockier, I think the boulders may be slightly smaller on the fenceline road than the section of McMurray Meadows Road after the pipe, so the shortcut may be preferred for lower clearance vehicles.

In my opinion, a 7.5\' and/or GPS may be necessary to negotiate this at that time of day--although they\'re accurate, I found the written directions alone to be insufficient.  I eventually gave up, and headed back to Big Pine to take the McMurry Meadows Road (this little diversion cost me an hour).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r&lt;br&gt;The McMurry Meadows Road is easy to follow, especially with the Forest Service directions (the Bishop ranger station office has a good information sheet on the Red Lake/Birch Lake trailheads).  The road may have been improved compared to past trip reports; the infamous pipe is now mostly buried under gravel, and there were no fords required at the stream crossings.  The road is nonetheless quite rough for about a mile or so after the pipe, with some large rounded rocks buried in the road, but it was passable by a Subaru Forester (7.5\" ground clearance).  This is the worst section of the road.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r&lt;br&gt;I was able to find the infamous shortcut on my way back in daylight, using the reverse directions from climber.org.  This shortcut was also negotiable by my Subaru.  Below are GPS waypoints I took on the return for the shortcut:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r&lt;br&gt;TOPO!

At the mine, the pavement ends and the road turns to a good graded dirt road, which winds its way west around the base of a hill.  The road peters out amidst piles of gravel, but a sandy track (see map below) leads shortly to a &lt;i&gt;very&lt;/i&gt; rocky \"road\"--this rocky track might also be followed directly from the mine road.  The rocky \"road\" runs alongside a fence, but the fence isn\'t too useful as a landmark for finding the track (especially at night), as it doesn\'t start until a little way along the track.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r&lt;br&gt;By the way, the drive to the trailhead from Big Pine took 60 minutes at night (stuck behind a slow car for the last few miles), while the drive back to Big Pine in daylight via the shortcut took 45 minutes.  Both drives were more exciting than the climbs.  I would probably just take McMurry Meadows Road again if I were heading to the trailhead at night.&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td valign=\"bottom\" style=\"padding-top: 6px;\" colspan=\"2\"&gt;&lt;span style=\"font-size: 9px; color: #888;\"&gt;Posted Jul 21, 2004 9:59 am&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;table border=\"0\" width=\"775\" class=\"messages\"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td width=\"110\" align=\"left\" valign=\"top\" style=\"padding-top: 6px;\"&gt;&lt;a name=\"329024\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a class=\"dis_user_lnk\" href=\"/users/dons/54807\"&gt;donS&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td valign=\"top\" style=\"padding-top: 6px;\"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Approach&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td align=\"right\" valign=\"top\" nowrap style=\"font-size: 10px;\"&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td valign=\"top\" rowspan=\"2\" align=\"left\" style=\"padding-top: 6px;\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=\"font-size: 9px; color: #888;\"&gt;Hasn\'t voted&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td colspan=\"2\" style=\"padding-top: 6px;\"&gt;The dirt road approach really isn\'t that complicated (in daylight anyway).  Exit 395 at S. Fish Springs Rd.  Take a left on Tinemaha Rd, to the campground.  Then a right on Fuller Road, going past the gravel mine.  there are a couple forks, but they all basically rejoin each other in a mile or so.  if you hit a locked gate, no big deal, just follow the road along the fence line till you can get through.  I know it sounds complex like a lot of turns, but basically if you just look up and see the peak and canyon, then aim for that point you will arrive.  you dont need 4wd, just some clearance... a subaru should be able to make it with careful driving.  20min highway to trailhead going fast in a truck, prob double that time if your going carefully in a lower vehicle.&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td valign=\"bottom\" style=\"padding-top: 6px;\" colspan=\"2\"&gt;&lt;span style=\"font-size: 9px; color: #888;\"&gt;Posted Jul 7, 2009 3:23 pm&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;table border=\"0\" width=\"775\" class=\"messages\"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td width=\"110\" align=\"left\" valign=\"top\" style=\"padding-top: 6px;\"&gt;&lt;a name=\"471360\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a class=\"dis_user_lnk\" href=\"/users/steve-pratt/2221\"&gt;Steve Pratt&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td valign=\"top\" style=\"padding-top: 6px;\"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Route warning&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td align=\"right\" valign=\"top\" nowrap style=\"font-size: 10px;\"&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td valign=\"top\" rowspan=\"2\" align=\"left\" style=\"padding-top: 6px;\"&gt;&lt;p class=\"disc_avatar\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"/users/steve-pratt/2221\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Steve Pratt\" width=\"50\" height=\"50\" border=\"0\" src=\"/images/avatars/186478.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=\"font-size: 9px; color: #888;\"&gt;Hasn\'t voted&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td colspan=\"2\" style=\"padding-top: 6px;\"&gt;Coming down the north slope:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Stay full to the left to return to the John Muir trail or full right to return to Red Lake.

In our early season descent we found a snowfield at the bottom of the slope leading to a significant cornice which was not visible from above.  Not a problem in good conditions, but in poor visibility this hazard has true death fall potential.

I can tell you for sure, as accessible as this Split Mt. might look, it was a pain to make it to the trailhead and also to the top. I ran into a lot of conflicting info from the start. Fist of all, the Fuller Rd is the way to go. Take it until the asphalt ends. Follow the dirt road to the first split that has a sign NO PASSING PRIVATE PROPERTY. Make a right there and follow the road. Without a GPS I\'ve never made it. I made the mistake of taking McMurry Rd back to the street and I drove for almost an hour and 30 minutes. That road it is in a way worst shape then Fuller Rd, at least for a sedan. I also need to point out I drove a sedan Nissan Sentra.&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td valign=\"bottom\" style=\"padding-top: 6px;\" colspan=\"2\"&gt;&lt;span style=\"font-size: 9px; color: #888;\"&gt;Posted Aug 7, 2013 4:36 pm&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;table border=\"0\" width=\"775\" class=\"messages\"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td width=\"110\" align=\"left\" valign=\"top\" style=\"padding-top: 6px;\"&gt;&lt;a name=\"491155\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a class=\"dis_user_lnk\" href=\"/users/lifer99/127601\"&gt;lifer99&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td valign=\"top\" style=\"padding-top: 6px;\"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Beautiful Hike, Easy Drive from South&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td align=\"right\" valign=\"top\" nowrap style=\"font-size: 10px;\"&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td valign=\"top\" rowspan=\"2\" align=\"left\" style=\"padding-top: 6px;\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=\"font-size: 9px; color: #888;\"&gt;Hasn\'t voted&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td colspan=\"2\" style=\"padding-top: 6px;\"&gt;We had a wonderful hike up to Red Lake, then to the crest of the Eastern Sierras. Driving in from the South, pick up your permit at the Eastern Sierra Interagency Visitors Center a couple of miles south of Lone Pine. There is a kiosk outside with a lockbox and you can request your pass to be left there at night (paid reservations only I think).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Continue up 395 and turn left onto Fish Springs Rd., then left again onto Tinemaha Rd. The paved road winds through a campground and becomes Fuller Rd. The pavement ends at the site of an unfenced commercial mining operation, and the good gravel road easily winds North then West along the base of a large red mound then meandering mostly North of Fuller Creek. The dirt road is a little rough with round rocks studding many spots at least 4\" high but easily driven over with a standard ground clearance car. At GPS coordinate 37.057053, -118.326544 on Google Maps, take a sharp left turn to the South and you will be on the McMurry Meadows Rd. which is the same as the way in from Big Pine. Continuing South, turn right at the Tinemaha Creek Rd. and follow the Forest Service signposts to the  Red Lake trailhead.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This way will easily save you 2 hours vs. driving up to Big Pine and taking McMurry Meadows Rd. We did this at midnight in a crewcab truck and had no trouble going in or out.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The actual trailhead is at the North fork of the last bit of dirt road ending at GPS coordinates 37.036612, -118.360028 on Google Maps. The trail begins going uphill West along a group of low trees near a creek then switchbacks a few times before heading South West high above Red Mountain Creek. If you were unfortunate enough to go to the other trailhead at the end of the South fork (which has a nice overhead sign announcing you are at Red Lake Trailhead), you will add several hours of bouldering along the creek before being forced to bushwack up the 45 degree hillside to rejoin the real trail.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;With 40 pound packs, we made it to Red Lake in 9 hours. Coming down was about the same amount of time, with the last 3 hours using headlamps at night.&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td valign=\"bottom\" style=\"padding-top: 6px;\" colspan=\"2\"&gt;&lt;span style=\"font-size: 9px; color: #888;\"&gt;Posted Jul 2, 2015 9:00 pm&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;table border=\"0\" width=\"775\"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;table cellpadding=\"2\" cellspacing=\"2\" width=\"100%\"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;&lt;span class=\"pagertext\"&gt;Viewing: &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;-&lt;b&gt;8&lt;/b&gt; of &lt;b&gt;8&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td align=\"center\"&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td align=\"right\"&gt;    &lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_10\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Images&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div align=\"center\"&gt;&lt;table id=\"my_images\"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/split-mountain-east-face/35826/c-150493\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Split Mountain East Face...\" src=\"/images/square/35826.JPG\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/split/331016/c-150493\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Split\" src=\"/images/square/331016.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/split-mountain/36720/c-150493\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Split Mountain\" src=\"/images/square/36720.JPG\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/from-green-red-lake/854660/c-150493\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"From Green Red Lake\" src=\"/images/square/854660.JPG\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/the-southeast-side-of-split/101421/c-150493\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"The Southeast side of Split...\" src=\"/images/square/101421.JPG\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/split-mountain-from-red-lake/126632/c-150493\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Split Mountain from Red Lake.\" src=\"/images/square/126632.JPG\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/split-from-cardinal/291571/c-150493\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Split from Cardinal\" src=\"/images/square/291571.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/from-boeing-electronic-news/31656/c-150493\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"From Boeing Electronic News\" src=\"/images/square/31656.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/split-mountain/890667/c-150493\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Split Mountain\" src=\"/images/square/890667.JPG\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/the-east-aspects-of-split/101420/c-150493\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"The East aspects of Split...\" src=\"/images/square/101420.JPG\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/red-lake-from-above-enroute/1479/c-150493\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Red Lake from above, enroute...\" src=\"/images/square/1479.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/split-mountain/435671/c-150493\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Split Mountain\" src=\"/images/square/435671.JPG\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/split-mountain/494355/c-150493\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Split Mountain\" src=\"/images/square/494355.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/morning-alpenglow-on-split/502542/c-150493\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Morning Alpenglow on Split\" src=\"/images/square/502542.JPG\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td colspan=\"7\" align=\"center\"&gt;[ &lt;a href=\"/split-mountain/images/p-150493\"&gt;View Gallery - 72 More Images&lt;/a&gt; ]&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/article&gt;date:difficulty:'),(32,150494,'/mount-lyell/150494','/yosemite-national-park/171226','Mount Lyell','','','','13114','',86706,37.7394,-119.271,'California, United States, North America','','',171226,'Yosemite National Park','','','','','','Mountain-Rock','content: &lt;article&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_1\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2 id=\"first_h2\"&gt;Overview&lt;/h2&gt;Mt. Lyell is the highest peak in Yosemite National Park. Located near the southeast boundary, it is a very popular destination despite its long distance (13.5 mi) from the nearest trailhead. It is easily recognizable from the summit of most peaks in Yosemite, thanks to the prominent Lyell Glacier on its northern flank, the largest in the park. An ancient metamorphosed slate tops the summit, which overlays a younger granite base.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Mt Lyell stands at the triple divide between two great Sierra rivers (the Merced and Tuolumne Rivers) and Rush Creek (which feeds Mono Lake).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For highpoint seekers, Mt. Lyell is the highest point in Tuolumne county, one of the more difficult of the 58 California county highpoints. It is most easily approached via Lyell Canyon from Tuolumne Meadows.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;table class=\"inline_image_thumbs\"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=49317\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/49317.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=20263\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/20263.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=10497\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/10497.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=62867\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/62867.JPG\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=23368\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/23368.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_2\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Getting There&lt;/h2&gt;The closest and most popular trailhead is at &lt;a href=\"http://www.summitpost.com/mountains/mountain_link.pl?mountain_id=759\"&gt;Tuolumne Meadows&lt;/a&gt;, off US120. Just east of the Tuolumne Meadows campground, there is a turnoff for the Tuolumne Lodge and Wilderness Permits. Pass the large lot for Wilderness permits (unless you need to get one!), and drive past the Ranger Station on the left side of the road. Before you reach the Tuolumne Lodge, there is a large parking lot on the left side. There are bear boxes there that you can leave food items that you do not take with you. Use them! Bears are rampant in these parts and will happily destroy your car to get a meal.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The trailhead is on the south side of the road, opposite the parking lot.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Alternatively, you can approach Mt. Lyell from the east via Rush Creek at Silver Lake Resort (near June Mtn Ski area) or Agnews Meadow near Mammoth Lakes (this is the longer of the two). Take the JMT to Donohue Pass to reach the Lyell Fork drainage. From a map it may be enticing to try approaching from the east via Marie Lakes instead of Donohue Pass, but be warned this is a class 4 route, and will certainly take longer. These routes are longer than approaching from Tuolumne Meadows and require more elevation gain.&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;table class=\"inline_image_thumbs\"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=23548\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/23548.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=42541\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/42541.JPG\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_3\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Red Tape&lt;/h2&gt;$20 fee to enter Yosemite NP. Good for seven days. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Wilderness permits are required for overnight camping. These can be obtained at any Ranger Station in Yosemite, including the station at Tuolumne Meadows (on the right as you turn off to park for the trailhead). Permits for the Lyell Fork of the Tuolumne Meadows are very popular and likely to be unavailable on weekends unless you arrive early to stand in line. Consider stopping at the entrance station on US120 if arriving from the west and getting a permit the night before.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For eastern approaches see the &lt;a href=\"http://www.summitpost.org/show/mountain_link.pl/mountain_id/4859\"&gt;Eastern Sierra - Logisitcal Center&lt;/a&gt; page.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Campfires are not permitted above 10,000 feet. Also, YNP regulations state the following: &lt;i&gt;You must camp at least four trail miles from Tuolumne Meadows, Yosemite Valley, Glacier Point, Hetch Hetchy, and Wawona, and at least one air mile from any road. Camping is prohibited in the Dana Fork of the Tuolumne River.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_4\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;When To Climb&lt;/h2&gt;Climbing is usually done May-Oct when the Tioga Road (US120) through Tuolumne Meadows is open. After Oct 15 the road is sometimes open, but overnight parking is no longer permitted. &lt;br&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_5\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Camping&lt;/h2&gt;Overnight camping is allowed in the Yosemite Wilderness with a valid permit (see above). For a climb of Mt. Lyell most parties camp in the upper portion of Lyell Canyon (where there are still trees), or in the sparser flat areas in the smaller canyons to the west of the JMT along the route.&lt;br&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_6\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Etymology&lt;/h2&gt;\"Named on July 2, 1863, by William H. Brewer and Charles F. Hoffmann of the California Geological Survey. &lt;br&gt;\'Mount Lyell, for Sir Charles Lyell (1797-1875), whose admirable geological works have been well known to students of this branch of science, in this country, for the past thirty years.\' (Whitney, Yosemite Guide-Book, 1870, 100.) &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Mount Lyell is the highest peak in Yosemite National Park. The first ascent was by John Boies Tileston of Boston, on August 29, 1871. \'I was up early the next morning, toasted some bacon, boiled my tea, and was off at six. I climbed the mountain, and reached the top of the highest pinnacle (\"inaccessible,\" acording to the State Geological Survey), before eight. I came down the mountain, and reached camp before one, pretty tired.\' (SCB 12, no. 3, 1926: 305.)\" &lt;br&gt;- &lt;b&gt;Peter Browning, &lt;i&gt;Place Names of the Sierra Nevada&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\"July 2 we are up early. First, a hasty and substantial breakfast, then we prepare to climb the highest peak back. The frost lies heavy on the grass, and we are some distance before the sun peeps over the hill. Over rocks and snow, the last trees are passed, we get on bravely, and think to be up by eleven o\'clock. We cross great slopes all polished like glass by former glaciers. Striking the last great slope of snow, we have only one thousand feet more to climb. In places the snow is soft and we sink two or three feet in it. We toil on for hours; it seems at times as if our breath refuses to strengthen us, we puff and blow so in the thin air. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;After over seven hours of hard climbing we struck the last pinnacle of rock that rises through the snow and forms the summit -- only to find it inaccessible, at least from that side. We had to stop at 125 or 150 feet below the top, being something over 13,000 feet above the sea, the baromter standing 18.7 inches. As we had named the other mountain Mount Dana, after the most eminent of American geologists, we named this Mount Lyell, after the most eminent of English geologists. &lt;br&gt;- &lt;b&gt;William Brewer, &lt;i&gt;Up and Down California&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The route chosen by Brewer and Hoffmann appears to be the standard route up the Lyell glacier on the peaks north side, a straightforward class 2-3 climb, so it remains unclear why they found the route \"inaccessible\". &lt;br&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_7\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;External Links&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://www.snwburd.com/bob/trip_reports/lyell_1.html\"&gt;Aug 6-7, 1998&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://www.stanford.edu/~holliman/hiking/lyell_0703\"&gt;A dayhike:  Climbing Mt.

You need a Whitney Zone stamp on your backcountry permit, or a dayhike permit (same as Mt. Whitney) if only going for the day. See the &lt;a href=\"http://www.summitpost.com/mountains/mountain_link.pl/mountain_id/45\"&gt;Mt. Whitney&lt;/a&gt; page for more details.

Muir is generally climbed as a sidetrip by those climbing Mt. Whitney who have a bit more energy than the average Whitney hiker. As such it can be climbed any time of year that Mt. Whitney can, which is to say all year round. Climbs in the winter months are more arduous and should only be undertaken by those skilled in winter mountaineering.&lt;br&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_5\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Camping&lt;/h2&gt;Again, see the &lt;a href=\"http://www.summitpost.com/mountains/mountain_link.pl/mountain_id/45\"&gt;Mt. Whitney&lt;/a&gt; page for camping information. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Just to show that I\'m not riding the coattails of Mt Whitney the whole way, I\'ll add my two cents:&lt;br&gt;The Mt. Whitney page says the two most popular camp locations are Trail Camp and Outpost Camp. You are allowed to camp elsewhere as long you follow all wilderness regulations, but there are few other flat spots off the trail with easy access to water (and of course no toilets). Trail Camp is the prime location for those wanting an easy summit day. Outpost Camp is usually taken up by those who can\'t get a permit for Trail Camp. Both campsites have zero privacy with the ever-popular Whitney Trail running through the middle of them. If this doesn\'t bother you, sign up. Otherwise, consider a dayhike, or for the truly adventurous, sleep the night at the summit. Most summer nights are nicer than you might expect on top. And the sunsets/sunrises are spectacular.&lt;br&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_6\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Mountain Conditions&lt;/h2&gt;See the &lt;a href=\"http://www.summitpost.com/mountains/mountain_link.pl/mountain_id/45\"&gt;Mt.

Weather Bureau. &lt;br&gt;- &lt;b&gt;Erwin Gudde, &lt;i&gt;California Place Names&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;\"John Muir (1838-1914), \'born in Scotland, reared in the University of Wisconsin, by final choice a Californian, widely traveled observer of the world we dwell in, man of science and of letters, friend and protector of Nature, uniquely gifted to interpret unto other men her mind and ways.\' (Benjamin Ide Wheeler, President of the University of California, conferring the degree of Doctor of Laws on Muir, May 14, 1913.) &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Muir was one of the four founders of the Sierra Club, and its first president, 1892-1914. He was the foremost conservationist of his time, a mountain explorer and exponent of the outdoor life. \'John Muir was not a \"dreamer,\" but a practical man, a faithful citizen, a scientific observer, a writer of enduring power, with vision, poetry, courage in a contest, a heart of gold, and a spirit pure and fine.\' (Robert Underwood Johnson in SCB 10, no. 1, Jan. 1916: 15. See that issue of SCB, 1-77.) &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[Muir Grove was] named by R. B. Marshall, USGS, in 1909. (Farquhar: Marshall.) The name appears on the second edition of the Tehipite 30\' map, 1912. On the first edition, 1905, it is simply called \'Big Trees.\' &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[Muir Lake] first appeared on the Olancha 15-minute quad, 1956. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[Mount Muir] is on the first edition of the Mt. Whitney 30\' map, 1907. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The pass was named by R. B. Marshall, USGS, and appears on the first Mt. Goddard 30\' map, 1912. It was first crossed with pack stock by a party led by George R. Davis, USGS, in 1907. (SCB 7, no. 1, Jan. 1909:4.) &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The hut (not named on the maps) was dedicated in 1933. \'As his work is destined to carry on through the years, so, the hope was expressed, this shelter, dedicated to him, may likewise serve for an untold period of time to offer protection and safety to storm-bound travelers.\' (SCB 19, no. 3, June 1934: 7.)\" &lt;br&gt;- &lt;b&gt;Peter Browning, &lt;i&gt;Place Names of the Sierra Nevada&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\"It was the spring of 1868 when a young, lanky, bewhiskered adventurer named John Muir picked his way past Inspiration Point and descended intoYosemite Valley. Muir stood transfixed by the spectacle of nature that unfolded before him. A lifelong love affair developed, an affair so engaging and irrepressible that it came to be embraced by an entire nation. It was, he would later write, \'a glorious wilderness that seemed to be calling with a thousand songful voices ... Beauty beyond thought everywhere, beneath, above, made and being made forever.\' With effusive words like those, Muir almost single-handedly championed the fledgling national cause of preservation. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Muir was 11 when his family emigrated from Scotland to Wisconsin in 1849. He worked on the family farm until he was 22 and then enrolled at the University of Wisconsin, studying literature, botany and geology. A mechanical wizard, he dropped out of school and took a job in an Indianapolis carriage shop. The pivotal point in his life occurred in 1867. A file slipped from his grasp and lanced his right eye. His left eye went sympathetically blind. Desperate, Muir vowed to devote his life to the study of the inventions of God should his sight return. When it did, he launched unswervingly into his new vocation as a tramp and embarked on a 1,000-mile journey to the Gulf of Mexico. While recuperating from a bout with malarial fever, Muir read a travel brochure extolling the beauties of a place called Yosemite. In hopes his fever might be cooled with mountain winds and delicious crystal water, Muir sailed to San Francisco and hiked 200 miles to Yosemite. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It was in Yosemite that he crystalized his life\'s goals. The wilderness became his laboratory for research and temple for worship. \'Climb the mountains and get their good tidings. Nature\'s peace will flow into you as sunshine flows into trees,\' he wrote. \'The winds will blow their own freshness into you and the storms their energy, while cares will drop off like autumn leaves.\' &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Muir made his home in Yosemite Valley from 1868 to 1873, working as a shepherd, a sawmill operator and guide when he needed money. He spent every spare moment scaling cliffs, sleuthing for glaciers, exploring and sketching mountain meadows and majestic peaks and recording his adventures in journals. He had a masterful way of transmuting physical danger into a kind of spiritual ecstasy. Once, while scaling a sheer wall above Yosemite Valley, he wound up riding a snow avalanche spread-eagle 2,500 feet to the canyon floor. Escaping unscathed, he wrote about the episode, \'Elijah\'s flight in a chariot of fire could hardly have been more gloriously exciting.\' Another time, stranded overnight on a frozen mountaintop, Muir stayed warm by dancing the Highland fling until sunrise. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Muir was the first to recognize that glaciation was largely responsible for carving Yosemite Valley. At the time, the prevailing theory among geologists was that a cataclysmic collapse was responsible. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;He wrote compulsively from about 1863 until his death a half century later. His first published work -- an article on glaciers -- appeared in the New York Tribune in 1871. Buoyed by his initial success, Muir became a professional nature writer to finance his mountain sojourns and nature studies. \'John the Baptist was not more eager to get all his fellow sinners into the Jordan than I to baptize all of mine in the beauty of God\'s mountains,\' he wrote. In 1874, Muir was lured away to explore the rest of the Sierra Nevada and Alaska, write, marry and raise a family and run a fruit ranch near Martinez. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;On a 1889 Yosemite visit, Muir and close friend Robert Underwood Johnson of Century magazine were appalled to find bare meadows, muddy streams, charred tree stumps, barbed-wire fences and unsightly commercial development. At Johnson\'s urging, Muir wrote articles focusing on the damage to the environment. The articles and an effective lobbying campaign culminated with the creation of Yosemite National Park on Oct. 1, 1890. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Father of Yosemite National Park and the Savior of the Sequoias was on personal terms with three presidents and was the guiding light behind the 1906 Antiquities Act, which gave the nation\'s chief executives the authority to proclaim national monuments. After a 1903 Yosemite camping trip with Muir, Theodore Roosevelt devised a policy that created five national parks and 23 monuments and placed 148 million acres in national forests.Besides Yosemite, Muir was a motivating force in the establishment of Sequoia, King\'s Canyon, Rainier, Petrified Forest and Grand Canyon national parks. In 1905, Muir, who by then had founded and was president of the Sierra Club, led the crusade that restored Yosemite Valley to federal control. Until then, the valley had been under the state\'s jurisdiction. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Along with so many successes, defeats were inevitable. The most grievous for Muir was his inability to save Hetch Hetchy Valley from being dammed to provide drinking water for San Francisco. In December 1914, a year after President Woodrow Wilson signed the Raker Act allowing San Francisco to build the dam, Muir left home to wander the Mojave Desert and came down with pneumonia. At 76, he died on Christmas Eve in Los Angeles and was buried behind his Martinez home.\" &lt;br&gt;-&lt;b&gt;Modesto Bee (online)&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\"Then it seemed to me the Sierra should be called not the Nevada or Snowy Range, but the Range of Light. And after ten years spent in the heart of it, rejoicing and wondering, bathing in the glorious floods of light, seeing the sunbursts of morning among the icy peaks, the noonday radiance on the trees and rocks and snow, the flush of the alpenglow, and a thousand dashing waterfalls with their marvelous abundance of irised spray, it still seems to me above all others the Range of Light, the most divinely beautiful of all the mountain chains I have ever seen.\" &lt;br&gt;- &lt;b&gt;John Muir&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;More on John Muir:&lt;br&gt;The Sierra Club\'s &lt;a href=\"http://www.sierraclub.org/john_muir_exhibit/\"&gt;John Muir Exhibit&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://www.sierraclub.org/john_muir_exhibit/writings/\"&gt;His writings&lt;/a&gt; (Many in full text)&lt;br&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_8\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;External Links&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ul&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://www.stanford.edu/~wacziarg/climbing/WhitneyOct02.html\"&gt;Mount Whitney, Crooks Peak, Mount Muir TR, October 2002.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;  &lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://www-db.stanford.edu/~crespo/Pictures/Langley03\"&gt;Muir via Whitney Trail&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://www.justhiking.com/hikes/2005/08-30whit/whit.htm\"&gt;Whitney/Muir/Wotan\'s Throne (08/30/2005)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;                                          &lt;a name=\"chapter_9\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Images&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div align=\"center\"&gt;&lt;table id=\"my_images\"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/sierra-fire/175360/c-150495\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Sierra Fire\" src=\"/images/square/175360.JPG\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/mt-muir-in-winter/378585/c-150495\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Mt.

Ritter is the highest peak in the Ritter Range, a volcanic ridge west of the Sierra Crest, just outside Yosemite\'s southeast boundary. The Minarets, a set of more than a dozen fantastically sharp pinnacles in this range, together with Mt. Ritter and Banner Peak make for a striking skyline when viewed from the Mammoth Lakes area. According to Secor, \"Mount Ritter is perhaps the most prominent peak in the High Sierra, and can even be seen from certain summits in the southern portion of the range.\" It is easily recognizeable (in conjunction with its neighbor Banner Peak) from as far north as the peaks around Sonora Pass, and far into the southern parts of the range, from the Palisades to Mt. Goddard, and some points even further. For highpoint seekers, Mt. Ritter is also the highpoint of Madera County, one of the more arduous of the 58 county highpoints in California.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Mt. Ritter is a popular climb, primarily approached via Agnew Meadow. It can be climbed as a dayhike, but is most often done as a multi-day outing into the surrounding Ansel Adams Wilderness. Alan Ritter\'s &lt;a href=\"http://climber.org/reports/1999/1734.html\"&gt;7 attempts&lt;/a&gt; to climb his namesake have become almost legend in climbing circles.&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;table class=\"inline_image_thumbs\"&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=5225\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/5225.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=49314\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/49314.jpg\" style=\"\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=2613\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/2613.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=2565\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/2565.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=1935\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/1935.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_2\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Getting There&lt;/h2&gt;From US395, take SR203 into Mammoth Lakes. Follow the highway (turn right at the second light) to the main lodge of Mammoth Mountain. If you are there before 7am or after 7pm, you can continue past the ski resort, driving over Minaret Summit and down towards &lt;a href=\"http://www.nps.gov/depo\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Devils Postpile. During the daylight hours above, all visitors must pay a $7/person fee, and use the mandatory shuttle bus. Cyclists can enter on their own without paying the fee, but will be charged if they use the shuttle bus on the way out. See the Red Tape section below.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Agnew Meadows is the first campground on the right, just as the road begins to turn south. Drive past the pack station to one of two parking lots on the left side of the graded dirt road. &lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;table class=\"inline_image_thumbs\"&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=78009\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/78009.JPG\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=77851\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/77851.jpg\" style=\"\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=78675\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/78675.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=146476\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/146476.jpg\" style=\"\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_3\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Red Tape&lt;/h2&gt;Lots of Red Tape. SR203 west of the Minaret Summit(designated \"Reds Meadow Valley\") has travel restrictions due to the narrow one-lane road (in many sections) and the limited parking available at the popular national monument. Travel by car into the area is unrestricted before 7am and after 7pm, so try to plan your trip accordingly. Between these hours it is required that you take the &lt;a href=\"//www.nps.gov/depo/depomain.htm\"&gt;shuttle bus&lt;/a&gt; which leaves every 30 minutes, and more frequently during periods of high use (buses will accommodate backpacks). If you want to do a loop starting at Agnew and returning to Devils Postpile, you can ride the shuttle for free back to Agnew Meadows. Once your vehicle is in the area, you are free to exit anytime of day, but you will be subject to a $10 per-vehicle charge if you haven\'t previously paid the fee and the entrance station is manned. Backpackers with permits do &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt; have an exemption from using the shuttle during normal daytime hours.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Entry fee into Reds Meadow Valley is $7 per person, which allows free use of the shuttle. A federal Interagency (NPS and USFS) pass can be used for the shuttle or vehicle fee. Fees collected are used to pay for and encourage the use of the shuttle bus.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Everything you need to know about permits and regulations can be found on the &lt;a href=\"http://www.summitpost.org/show/mountain_link.pl/mountain_id/4859\"&gt;Eastern Sierra - Logisitcal Center&lt;/a&gt; page.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;On the more popular trails (Thousand Island Lake, Shadow Lake, Minaret Lake, etc.) camp fires are not permitted and camping is restricted to designated areas. On popular summer weekends the quota for permits may run out, so advance reservation is advised (fee apply). &lt;br&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_4\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;When To Climb&lt;/h2&gt;Mt. Ritter can be climbed generally only as long as Highway 203 remains open west of the Sierra Crest. The road is closed during winter months due to the high danger of avalanche on the upper section of the highway. The road usually opens around Memorial Day, and closes sometime in mid-October. Call the Ranger Station for closure information if you plan a trip near either of these times.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Climbing during other times in the year can still be done, but will require a longer trek starting near the Mammoth Mtn main ski lodge. &lt;br&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_5\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Camping&lt;/h2&gt;Camping is allowed in most places in the Ansel Adams Wilderness. There are special restrictions in the area between Shadow Lake and Ediza Lake, designed to reduce impact in these highly used areas. You can get information on these restrictions at the Ranger Station when you pick up your permit, and there are maps posted along the trail showing the restricted areas. &lt;br&gt;The best (and closest) camping is probably on the northwest side of Ediza Lake.&lt;br&gt;Camping at Agnew Meadows is available for $16 per site for those looking for more than Wilderness amenities. Contact the Forest Service for advanced reservations.&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;table class=\"inline_image_thumbs\"&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=25888\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/25888.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=124611\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/124611.JPG\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_6\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Mountain Conditions&lt;/h2&gt;The &lt;a href=\"http://www.fs.fed.us/r5/inyo/vc/mammoth.html\"&gt;Mammoth Lakes Visitor Center &amp;amp; Ranger Station&lt;/a&gt; can provide the latest information on trail and climbing conditions.&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;table class=\"inline_image_thumbs\"&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=63337\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/63337.JPG\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_7\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Etymology&lt;/h2&gt;\"The Mountain was named by the Whitney Survey in 1864. \'Ritter is the name of the great German geographer, the founder of the science of modern comparative geography.\' (Whitney, Yosemite Guide-Book, 1870, 101.) Karl Ritter (1779-1859) was a professor of history at the University of Berlin when Whitney was a student there during the 1840s. &lt;br&gt;John Muir made the first ascent in October 1872. \'I was suddenly brought to a dead stop, with arms outspread, clinging close to the face of the rock, unable to move hand or foot either up or down. My doom appeared fixed. I must fall. There would be a moment of bewilderment, and then a lifeless rumble down the one general precipice to the glacier below. When this final danger flashed upon me, I became nerve-shaken for the first time since setting foot on the mountain, and my mind seemed to fill with a stifling smoke. But ... life blazed forth again with preternatural clearness. I seemed suddenly to become possessed of a new sense. ... Then my trembling muscles became firm again, every rift and flaw in the rock was seen as through a microscope, and my limbs moved with a positiveness and precision with which I seemed to have nothing at all to do. Had I been borne aloft upon wings, my deliverance could not have been more complete. ... I found a way without effort, and soon stood upon the topmost crag in the blessed light.\' (Muir, Mountains, 64-65.) &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The mountain is named on Hoffmann and Gardiner\'s map, 1863-67. \'Ritter Range\' appears on the fifth edition of the Mt. Lyell 30\' map, 1922. Neither the lakes nor the pass are named on the 15-minute quad. There are four lakes, two large and two small, west of Mt. Ritter and south of Lake Catherine. The pass is over the range 1.2 miles south-southeast of Mt. Ritter.\" &lt;br&gt;- &lt;b&gt;Peter Browning, &lt;i&gt;Place Names of the Sierra Nevada&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\"From their base camp on Illilouette Creek they [Clarence King and James Gardiner] explored further among the Merced Peaks, then crossed to the San Joaquin and followed up the North Fork of the river. They made an attempt to climb Mount Ritter, but failed on account of unfavorable weather. King said that he \'climbed to a point about as high as Mt. Dana, and had still above him an inaccessible peak some 400 or 500 feet high.\' Inaccessible, again! Whitney records that \'Messrs. King and Gardner discovered a bed of ice on the east slope of Mount Ritter. But it is doubtful,\' he adds, \'whether these residual masses of ice can with propriety be called glaciers; they have no geological significance as such at the present time, however interesting they may be as possible relics of a once general glaciation of the highest part of the range.\' Thus both the ascent of Mount Ritter and the identification of glaciers had to wait for John Muir.\" &lt;br&gt;- &lt;b&gt;Francis P. Farquhar, &lt;i&gt;History of the Sierra Nevada&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[In 1892] Solomons and Peixotto teamed up with [Joseph N.] LeConte for an excursion south toward Mount Ritter, that dark beacon that looms immediately southeast of the present Yosemite National Park boundary. Following in the footsteps of John Muir, the three youths climbed the peak from the east; it was only the third time its 13,157-foot summit had been reached.

Round Top is a prominent peak in the Tahoe region, one of three mountains (the other two are &lt;a href=\"http://www.summitpost.com/mountains/mountain_link.pl/mountain_id/1492\"&gt;Freel Peak &lt;/a&gt;and &lt;a href=\"http://www.summitpost.com/mountains/mountain_link.pl/mountain_id/551\"&gt;Mount Rose&lt;/a&gt;) above 10,000 feet that are visible from Lake Tahoe. Its distinctive rounded summit of dark volcanic basalt towers above a beautiful alpine country that is rare in this part of Sierra Nevada. It is located near Carson Pass on California State Route 88, one of the trans-Sierra routes that is open during the winter. It is located south of Carson Pass in the Mokelumne Wilderness and the &lt;a href=\"http://www.fs.fed.us/r5/eldorado/recreation/wild/moke/cpma/\"&gt; Carson Pass Management Area&lt;/a&gt; and is a nice side trip for those traveling the Pacific Crest Trail. Round Top offers views south towards Ebbets and Sonora Pass, east toward Hope Valley and the Carson River, west overlooking Caples Lake and the Kirkwood Ski area and northward one can see Lake Tahoe. If the air is very clear, &lt;a href&gt;Mount Diablo &lt;/a&gt;in the East San Francisco Bay area can be seen. Because of its close proximity to the South Shore of Lake Tahoe and Kirkwood ski resort, it is also a popular destination for ski touring and mountaineering, but is busy year round, with many people headed for the summit. On holiday weekends it can be tough finding a parking space and the trail seems like a crowded highway.  Its easiest route is class 2, although the summit block (the eastern crag) is rated class 3. On its north and east sides there are some challenging volcanic cliffs. The mountain is close enough to the road to do it on a moderate day hike&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;table class=\"inline_image_thumbs\"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=79308\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/79308.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=20901\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/20901.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=1609\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/1609.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=9005\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/9005.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=30741\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/30741.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_2\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Getting There&lt;/h2&gt;There are two trailheads:&lt;br&gt;To get to one trailhead from the Tahoe Area Travel south on CA State Route 89 (starting at its junction with U.S Highway 50) for approximately 11.5 to its junction with CA State Route 88 in Hope Valley. Turn right (west) onto S.R. 88 and drive for approximately 9 miles to the summit of Carson Pass. The parking area will be on the south side of the road with a small information building at the east end. The information hut is only manned during the summer months. &lt;br&gt;From the west the trail head / parking area is approximaetly 70 miles east of Jackson, CA on State Route 88.&lt;br&gt;The closer but lower one is at Woods Lake, elevation 8200 ft. Take highway 88 a few miles west of Carson Pass, then take the Woods Lake turn off on the south side. Proceed 2 miles to trailhead. From Jackson it is a couple of miles before you reach the summit.&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;table class=\"inline_image_thumbs\"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=46672\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/46672.JPG\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=79303\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/79303.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=78994\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/78994.JPG\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=78997\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/78997.JPG\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=30564\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/30564.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_3\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Red Tape&lt;/h2&gt;There is now a &lt;a href=\"http://www.fs.fed.us/r5/eldorado/recreation/wild/moke/cpma/\"&gt; Carson Pass Management Area&lt;/a&gt; for the area immediately around and including Round Top Peak and some new regulations. During the summer a $5.00 day use fee is charged at the Carson Pass, Carson Pass Overflow, Woods Lake, and Meiss trailheads. Your &lt;a href=\"http://www.nps.gov/fees_passes.htm\"&gt;National Parks and Federal Recreation Lands Pass&lt;/a&gt; is good here. A season permit can be purchased for $15.00. If visiting the area in winter, a Snow Park Pass is required. The daily fee is $5 and a season pass can be purchased for $30. These can be purchased at any Forest Service office and at many retail stores. Many AAA offices also sell Snow Park Permits. The closest place to obtain a Snow Park permit is the gas station next to the Kirkwood Nordic center 6 miles west on S.R. 88. &lt;br&gt;If one is camping, in any part of the wilderness other than the Carson Pass management Area, a Wilderness Permit is needed and can be ordered from any El Dorado National Forest Ranger office, from the Carson Pass Information Station at the trail head in summer or the Amador Ranger Station which is located at  &lt;a href=\"http://maps.yahoo.com/py/maps.py?Pyt=Tmap&amp;amp;ed=VSCeXep_0TqaDB11R1V86iW0K3Fq7NpZIwUvySbpd6vRClogSwKvm4pXYN7pQnuNJJpAzoPG8zwuaF9Mtp69Hg--&amp;amp;csz=Pioneer,+CA+95666-9630&amp;amp;country=us&amp;amp;cs=9&amp;amp;name=&amp;amp;desc=&amp;amp;poititle=&amp;amp;poi=&amp;amp;uz=95666&amp;amp;ds=n&amp;amp;BFKey=&amp;amp;BFCat=&amp;amp;BFClient=&amp;amp;mag=8&amp;amp;newmag=9&amp;lt;br%20/&amp;gt;%0D%0A\"&gt;26820 Silver Drive Pioneer, CA&lt;/a&gt; (click on the address for a Yahoo map)just off of Highway 88, about 3 miles east of Pioneer and is open Monday through Friday.

Only one permit is needed for continuous trips passing through more than one wilderness area. Maximum group size for a day hike is 12 people.  Only 8 people for an overnight stay. If you plan on using a stove, even if on a day hike, a fire permit is required and can be picked up at any U.S. Forest Service office.The fire permit is good for the entire state of California. There are no wood fires allowed above 8000 ft. &lt;br&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_4\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;When To Climb&lt;/h2&gt;The peak can be climbed year round with some good winter ski runs. For those desiring to not climb in the snow, generally late June through September is the best time.&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;table class=\"inline_image_thumbs\"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=7349\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/7349.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=16902\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/16902.JPG\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=5360\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/5360.JPG\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=5361\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/5361.JPG\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=18574\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/18574.JPG\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_5\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Camping&lt;/h2&gt;Camping is allowed in the Mokelumne Wilderness with the proper permit. the restrictions for the &lt;a href=\"http://www.fs.fed.us/r5/eldorado/recreation/wild/moke/cpma/\"&gt; Carson Pass Management Area&lt;/a&gt; are more restrictive than the rest of the wilderness area. There is no summer camping at Frog Lake. There are three sites at Winnemuca Lake, six sites at both Round Top Lake and Fourth of July Lake. Winter camping is allowed once the snow pack is 12 inches deep. From the Friday before Memorial Day through Labor Day weekend, an overnight stay limit will be in effect of 2 nights for Round Top and Winnemucca Lakes and 3 nights for the Fourth of July Lakes. Permits can only be obtained at the Carson Pass Information Staion in the summer and the Amador Ranger Station at all other times of the year. Down from the pass in both directions are regular Forest Service fee campgrouds. The closest being Woods Lake and Caples Lake to the west for summer camping only. There are also a couple of stores and restaurants fairly close to the west at Caples Lake and Kirkwood. Use a bear canister to store food in order to deter marauding bears. &lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;table class=\"inline_image_thumbs\"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=6147\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/6147.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=18575\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/18575.JPG\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=30909\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/30909.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=19139\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/19139.JPG\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=30735\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/30735.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_6\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Mountain Conditions&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://www.wunderground.com/US/CA/Kirkwood.html?bannertypeclick=big2\"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src=\"http://banners.wunderground.com/weathersticker/big2_both_cond/language/www/US/CA/Kirkwood.gif\" border=\"0&amp;lt;/a\"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://www.dot.ca.gov/hq/roadinfo/sr88\"&gt;State Route 88 road conditions&lt;/a&gt; can be found online or by phoning the California Department of Transportation road condition line at 1-800-427-7623.

I had to carry a barometer, bag with lunch, thermometer, levels, hammer, etc., a canteen, and my botanical box.  We have had high winds for several days, and in the morning clouds enveloped the summit of the peak, but they fled before I reached it.  The last eight hundred or a thousand feet rise in a steep volcanic mass, so steep as to be only accessible in one place, around cliffs and up steep slopes on the rocks, but there was no serious difficulty or danger.  A cold, raw, and fierce wind swept over the summit, but the day was very clear and the view sublime.  The peak is just south of Carson Pass, and some twenty to twenty-five miles south of Lake Tahoe (Bigler).  The lake was in full view its whole extent--my first sight of it--its waters intensely blue, high, bold mountains rising from its shores.  I am higher than the great crest of the Sierra here and hundreds of snowy peaks are in sight.  Hope Valley lies beneath, green and lovely--high mountains, eleven thousand feet high rising beyond it.  Besides Lake Tahoe, there are &lt;i&gt;ten&lt;/i&gt; smaller lakes in sight, from two miles long down to mere ponds (which were not counted)--all blue, of clear snow water.  It was, indeed, a grand view.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r&lt;br&gt;I descended by getting on a steep slope of snow, down which I came a thousand feet in a few minutes where it had taken two hours\' hard labor to get up.\"&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;- William Brewer, &lt;i&gt;Up and Down California&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td valign=\"bottom\" style=\"padding-top: 6px;\" colspan=\"2\"&gt;&lt;span style=\"font-size: 9px; color: #888;\"&gt;Posted May 27, 2003 12:56 am&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;table border=\"0\" width=\"775\" class=\"messages\"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td width=\"110\" align=\"left\" valign=\"top\" style=\"padding-top: 6px;\"&gt;&lt;a name=\"431910\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a class=\"dis_user_lnk\" href=\"/users/lincolnb/69617\"&gt;LincolnB&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td valign=\"top\" style=\"padding-top: 6px;\"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Shortest route&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td align=\"right\" valign=\"top\" nowrap style=\"font-size: 10px;\"&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td valign=\"top\" rowspan=\"2\" align=\"left\" style=\"padding-top: 6px;\"&gt;&lt;p class=\"disc_avatar\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"/users/lincolnb/69617\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"LincolnB\" width=\"50\" height=\"50\" border=\"0\" src=\"/images/avatars/813061.JPG\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=\"font-size: 9px; color: #888;\"&gt;Hasn\'t voted&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td colspan=\"2\" style=\"padding-top: 6px;\"&gt;Probably the shortest route up Round Top is to park at Woods lake and take the trail toward Round Top lake.

Early in the year there is much snow (and considerably more gear to carry); late in the year the U- Notch can be hard ice (requiring considerably more skill) when approached from the Palisade Glacier. July-Aug are the most common climbing months.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Winter climbs are possible but few. This is for very experienced alpine climbers only.&lt;br&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_5\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Camping&lt;/h2&gt;Camping is allowed in most places of the SEKI and John Muir Wildernesses that surround Polemonium Peak. For east-north approaches, most climbers camp at Sam Mack Meadow, the toe of the Palisade Glacier, or somewhere in-between along the use trail that connects them. The glacier offers the closest approach, though suitable camping sites are limited. There are several sandy pads that have been cleared out amongst the rocks on the morraine there, but other sites are little more than flat granite slabs. &lt;br&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_6\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Mountain Conditions&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://www.r5.fs.fed.us/inyo/whatsnew.htm\"&gt;Eastern Sierra&lt;/a&gt; Road &amp;amp; Trail conditions, plus permit information&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://www.r5.fs.fed.us/inyo/\"&gt;Inyo NF&lt;/a&gt; online&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://www.r5.fs.fed.us/inyo/vvc/whitemtn/\"&gt;White Mountain Ranger Station&lt;/a&gt;: 798 North Main Street, Bishop, CA 93514.

(Approved by a BGN decision in 1985. The first altitude given [13,962] is the one on the 7.5-minute quad, published in 1982. The second one [14,080] is from the BGN\'s Decision List No. 8501.) The name comes from sky pilot Polimonium eximium, which grows at high alititude on rock ledges and slopes. The peak is not named on the Mt. Goddard 15\' quad. It is 1/2 mile southeast of North Palisade; no altitude is given.\" &lt;br&gt;- &lt;b&gt;Peter Browning, &lt;i&gt;Place Names of the Sierra Nevada&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There is still a good deal of confusion as to where Polemonium Peak is located and just how high it is. The above description confuses the true summit with Peak 13,962ft that is located 0.3 to the southeast, probably because the name is incorrectly placed on some maps. In Stephen F. Porcella\'s and Cameron M. Burns\' Climbing California\'s Fourteeners, they correctly locate the peak but incorrectly give an altitude of 14,200 ft. R. J. Secor appears to have both the location and height [14,080] correctly described in &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;The High Sierra: Peaks, Passes, and Trails&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_8\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;External Links&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://www.snwburd.com/bob/trip_reports/polemonium.html\"&gt;Aug 4, 2000&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://www.summitpost.org/cgi-bin/trip_report.pl?trip_report_id=1985&amp;amp;mountain_id=262\"&gt;Mark N&rsquo; Dirk&rsquo;s Bivouac Trilogy - Part 3: North Palisade &amp;amp; Polemonium&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;                     &lt;a name=\"chapter_9\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Images&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div align=\"center\"&gt;&lt;table id=\"my_images\"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/starting-up-pol/322846/c-150513\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"starting up pol\" src=\"/images/square/322846.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/tom-h-and-nancy-r-on-the/2761/c-150513\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Tom H and Nancy R on the...\" src=\"/images/square/2761.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/palisades-with-labels/331294/c-150513\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Palisades with labels\" src=\"/images/square/331294.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/polemonium-traverse/477013/c-150513\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Polemonium Traverse\" src=\"/images/square/477013.JPG\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/polemonium-peak-june-1994/38432/c-150513\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Polemonium Peak&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;\r June 1994\" src=\"/images/square/38432.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/palisades-in-early-morning/331287/c-150513\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Palisades in early morning\" src=\"/images/square/331287.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/v-notch-couloir-on-24/128107/c-150513\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"V-notch couloir on 24...\" src=\"/images/square/128107.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/sill-left-and-polemonium/65901/c-150513\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Sill (left) and Polemonium...\" src=\"/images/square/65901.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/polemonium-peak-from-the-palisade-glacier/326396/c-150513\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Polemonium Peak from the Palisade Glacier\" src=\"/images/square/326396.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/overlooking-fourth-lake/949413/c-150513\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Overlooking Fourth Lake\" src=\"/images/square/949413.JPG\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/on-the-v-notch-september/12185/c-150513\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"On the V Notch - September...\" src=\"/images/square/12185.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view-of-the-north-palisade/65176/c-150513\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"View of the North Palisade...\" src=\"/images/square/65176.JPG\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/david-loring-approaching-the/29592/c-150513\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"David Loring approaching the...\" src=\"/images/square/29592.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/day-2-camp-at-palisade-basin/543887/c-150513\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Day 2, Camp at Palisade Basin\" src=\"/images/square/543887.JPG\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td colspan=\"7\" align=\"center\"&gt;[ &lt;a href=\"/polemonium-peak/images/p-150513\"&gt;View Gallery - 48 More Images&lt;/a&gt; ]&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/article&gt;date:difficulty:');

Agassiz in the north to Cardinal Mtn in the south (between Bishop and Taboose passes). This ridge includes seven of the California 14ers and some of the finest climbing in the Sierras. This region was the center of Norman Clyde\'s adventures, with the summit of Middle Palisade visible from his cabin on the Big Pine Creek.&lt;br&gt;Climbs on the northeast side are the most commonly used, originating from the South Fork, Big Pine Creek TH. The Middle Palisades Glacier lies on this side, an immense span of snow and ice that is split in two by a moraine attached to the Northeast Face. All routes on this side except the Northeast Face will require crossing the glacier which can be difficult in summers following dry winters. Note that for the standard route on the NE Face which uses a class 2 ramp at the start, a small portion of the upper glacier must be crossed to access the start. The southwest side of Middle Palisade has a number of generally snow-free routes, but they are notoriously loose and difficult.&lt;br&gt;Another option, difficult but rewarding, is the class 4 traverse from Disappointment&lt;br&gt;Peak. A fine loop can be made in climbing both of these peaks from the north side of the crest.&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;table class=\"inline_image_thumbs\"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=26175\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/26175.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=16610\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/16610.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=71377\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/71377.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=71383\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/71383.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=71384\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/71384.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_2\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Getting There&lt;/h2&gt;Take US395 to Big Pine.

For east-north approaches, there are two excellent camp locations within easy reach of Middle Palisade. The lower (and nicer) location is at the mouth of Finger Lake. There are some nice levelled pad areas on the east side of the creek, about 30 feet above the lake level. Further up, about 400 feet above the inlet to Finger Lake is a small bench with level areas and a source of water. No trees or other protection from the elements up here, but you have a grand view of the Middle Palisade Glacier and the surrounding peaks.&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;table class=\"inline_image_thumbs\"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=26233\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/26233.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_6\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Mountain Conditions&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://www.fs.fed.us/r5/inyo/currentconditions/index.html\"&gt;Eastern Sierra&lt;/a&gt; Road &amp;amp; Trail conditions, &lt;a href=\"http://www.fs.fed.us/r5/inyo/recreation/wild/permits_res.html\"&gt;permit&lt;/a&gt; information&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://www.r5.fs.fed.us/inyo/\"&gt;Inyo NF&lt;/a&gt; online&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://www.fs.fed.us/r5/inyo/vc/wmrs.html\"&gt;White Mountain Ranger Station&lt;/a&gt;: 798 North Main Street, Bishop, CA 93514.

I think you could make it a bit better with some changes to the first paragraph.  The page says \"The Middle Palisades Glacier lies on this side, an immense span of snow and ice that is split in two by a morraine attached to the Northeast Face.\"  I\'m not positive, but I think the glacier to the NW of the moraine is actually a separate glacier, known as Clyde glacier.  Also, I think there\'s a typo in \"morraine\".&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;More importantly, I\'m not sure the \"except the NE Face\" from the following sentence is always true: \"All routes on this side except the Northeast Face will require crossing the glacier which can be difficult in summers following dry winters.\"&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I was on the NE Face route in Aug \'07 (following a dry winter), and it required about 100\' of glacier crossing, which would have been difficult to avoid if you wanted to gain the 3rd class ramp.  We managed to make it across without ice axe or crampons, but if it\'s really icy, this might not be possible.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So, even for the NE Face, climbers should at least consider bringing crampons and/or ice axe.&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td valign=\"bottom\" style=\"padding-top: 6px;\" colspan=\"2\"&gt;&lt;span style=\"font-size: 9px; color: #888;\"&gt;Posted Aug 28, 2007 4:16 pm&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;table border=\"0\" width=\"745\" class=\"messages\" style=\"margin-left: 30px;\"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td rowspan=\"4\" valign=\"top\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/styles/layout/reply_arrow.gif\"&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td width=\"110\" align=\"left\" valign=\"top\" style=\"padding-top: 6px;\"&gt;&lt;a name=\"215345\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a class=\"dis_user_lnk\" href=\"/users/bob-burd/276\"&gt;Bob Burd&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td valign=\"top\" style=\"padding-top: 6px;\"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Re: glacier crossing&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td align=\"right\" valign=\"top\" nowrap style=\"font-size: 10px;\"&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td valign=\"top\" rowspan=\"2\" align=\"left\" style=\"padding-top: 6px;\"&gt;&lt;p class=\"disc_avatar\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"/users/bob-burd/276\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Bob Burd\" width=\"50\" height=\"50\" border=\"0\" src=\"/images/avatars/1177.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=\"font-size: 9px; color: #888;\"&gt;Hasn\'t voted&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td colspan=\"2\" style=\"padding-top: 6px;\"&gt;The Norman Clyde Glacier is indeed a separate glacier, but it is much further west, separated from the Middle Pal Glacier by the North Ridge of Norman Clyde Peak.

Thanks for keeping the page up-to-date!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I saw a climber come up the north side of the Middle Pal glacier and scramble into the chute without any problem (I didn\'t see his exact line), but he went from glacier to summit in about 20 minutes, so his mountain experience doesn\'t apply to most of us.

Whitney\'s additional 400 feet which makes it the tallest in the contiguous US, Mt. Russell receives only a fraction of the visitors. As one of the fifteen California 14ers, Mt. Russell hardly suffers from neglect, however, and its excellent rock climbing and the relative difficulty of the easiest routes makes it a favorite among mountaineers. &lt;br&gt;The west and southwest faces feature sheer walls that rival those found on Whitney\'s East Face. There are various class 3-4 routes on the south, east, and north sides of the peak. The summit is a knife-edge with two high points on either end. The western point is the higher one. &lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;table class=\"inline_image_thumbs\"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=132815\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/132815.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=86865\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/86865.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=10651\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/10651.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=72748\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/72748.JPG\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=20322\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/20322.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_2\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Getting There&lt;/h2&gt;Take US395 to Lone Pine, head west 13 miles on the Whitney Portal Road to ... you guessed it ...

Russell if you plan to travel via the North Fork of Lone Pine Creek (the usual approach). The peak can be climbed from the north to stay out of the Whitney Zone, but this is a difficult dayhike and will probably require an overnight permit. Regular Wilderness permits are required for overnight stays. These may be difficult to attain by advance reservations, particularly for busy weekends. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Everything you need to know about permits and regulations can be found on the &lt;a href=\"http://www.summitpost.org/show/mountain_link.pl/mountain_id/4859\"&gt;Eastern Sierra - Logisitcal Center&lt;/a&gt; page.&lt;br&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_4\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;When To Climb&lt;/h2&gt;Climbing is usually done May-Oct. Earlier in the year there is much snow, and it should only be attempted by experienced alpine mountaineers. Later in the year there is a greater risk of early snowfall trapping unprepared climbers.&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;table class=\"inline_image_thumbs\"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=122180\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/122180.JPG\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=93901\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/93901.JPG\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=10456\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/10456.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=122185\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/122185.JPG\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=122183\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/122183.JPG\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_5\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Camping&lt;/h2&gt;Camping is allowed in most areas in the SEKI and John Muir Wildernesses that surround Mt. Russell. There are a variety of lakes on all side of Mt. Russelll that offer decent camping, including Arctic, Tulainyo, and Upper Boy Scout Lakes (the later being quite popular for an east side entry). Permits can be obtained in advance or at the Whitney Ranger Station in Lone Pine when you arrive. &lt;br&gt;Bear canisters are now required for hikes originating from Whitney Portal. In addition, Marmots are also very aggressive in this area, and caution should be used when leaving food at camp for the day. &lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;table class=\"inline_image_thumbs\"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=133071\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/133071.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=88964\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/88964.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=94957\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/94957.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_6\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Mountain Conditions&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://www.fs.fed.us/r5/inyo/conditions/north_report.htm\"&gt;Eastern Sierra&lt;/a&gt; Road &amp;amp; Trail conditions, plus permit information&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://www.fs.fed.us/r5/inyo/\"&gt;Inyo NF&lt;/a&gt; online&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;MOUNT WHITNEY RANGER STATION &lt;br&gt;P.O.

It is Lake Mono. At times the waters reflect the mountains beyond with strange distinctness and impress one as being in some way peculiar, but usually their ripples gleam and flash in the sunlight like the waves of ordinary lakes. No one would think from a distant view that the water which seems so bright and enticing is in reality so dense and alkaline that it would quickly cause death of a traveler who could find no other with which to quench his thirst. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;... &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The formation as a whole resembles a forest of gnarled and contorted trunks and stumps changed to stone. The impression which this imitation forest leaves on the mind is that it is in some way weird and uncanny. The silent and motionless trunks with their uncouth shapes recall Dante\'s description of the wood of the suicides. This fancy is heightened by the proximity of a sea whose flowerless shores seem scarcely to belong to the habitable earth.\" &lt;br&gt;- &lt;b&gt;Russell, Israel C., 1889, &lt;i&gt;Quaternary history of the Mono Valley, California: : U.S. Geol.

It is one of the more difficult peaks in the park; all of its routes are class 5, including the classic South to North Traverse. It can be reached relatively easily from Tuolumne Meadows, but gets much fewer climbers than its more famous neighbor, &lt;a href=\"http://www.summitpost.com/mountains/mountain_link.pl/mountain_id/392\"&gt;Cathedral Peak&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;table class=\"inline_image_thumbs\"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=52183\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/52183.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=144177\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/144177.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=7753\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/7753.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=22317\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/22317.JPG\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=66574\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/66574.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_2\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Getting There&lt;/h2&gt;The easiest approach is via the Cathedral Lakes trail in &lt;a href=\"http://www.summitpost.com/mountains/mountain_link.pl?mountain_id=759\"&gt;Tuolumne Meadows&lt;/a&gt;. From either the east or west, take Highway 120 into Yosemite NP and drive to Tuolumne Meadows. The Cathedral Lakes Trailhead is located on the west end of the meadow, about a mile west of the visitor center. It is a very busy trailhead and there are usually a dozen or more cars parked there at any given time during the summer.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Other approach options using the Bud Creek Trail are described in the Approach section of the &lt;a href=\"http://www.summitpost.org/show/route_link.pl/route_id/188/object_id/384\"&gt;South to North Traverse page&lt;/a&gt;. These may be faster, but require more cross-country travel. &lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;table class=\"inline_image_thumbs\"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=86264\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/86264.JPG\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=85993\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/85993.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=86263\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/86263.JPG\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=121828\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/121828.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_3\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Red Tape&lt;/h2&gt;Permits are not required for day hikes, but Wilderness permits are required for overnight visits. These can be obtained from any ranger station in the park. The nearest location is the permit building just east of the Tuolmne Meadows campground.

Before and after this time Highway 120 is closed. There can be much snow on the ground in May and June, so check ahead and plan accordingly if you intend to climb at this time. Late in October the highway is often open but closed to overnight parking - dayhikes to Matthes Crest can still be done easily.&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;table class=\"inline_image_thumbs\"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=86098\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/86098.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=116966\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/116966.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=86279\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/86279.JPG\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=128718\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/128718.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_5\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Camping&lt;/h2&gt;Camping is allowed in the Yosemite Wilderness that surrounds Matthes Crest with a valid Wilderness permit (no charge). Note that camping is not allowed in the Budd Creek drainage, nor north of Cathedral Pass since they fall within the four-mile exclusion zone (measured from all trailheads in Tuolumne Meadows). Late in the summer there is little or no water in the streams in the upper portions of the canyons on either side of Matthes Crest. You can find suitable campsites with water at Echo and Matthes Lakes, south of the peak. These are prime bear patrol areas, so guard your food well!&lt;br&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_6\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Mountain Conditions&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://www.nps.gov/yose/\"&gt;NPS Page&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_7\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Etymology&lt;/h2&gt;\"The names [Crest and Lake] were first suggested for, and to, Francois E. Matthes in 1946; the proposal was made more formally by Reid Moran, a YNP ranger, in 1949. \'Dr. Matthes was a very modest and unassuming man and would have been the last to suggest that anything be named in his honor. However, he was greatly pleased at the suggestion that this ridge bear his name, saying he knew no other unnamed feature in the Sierra which he would rather have chosen.\' (SCB 34, no. 6, June 1949: 110-11.) Matthes Crest was known informally during the 1930s as \'Echo Ridge\' because of its proximity to Echo Peaks and Echo Lake. &lt;br&gt;Francois Emile Matthes, a USGS geologist for 51 years, made extensive studies in Yosemite and elsewhere in the Sierra Nevada. Among nearly 100 published works, Matthes had 14 articles in various issues of the Sierra Club Bulletin. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The glaciers are not named on the Blackcap Mtn. and Mt. Goddard 13\' quads. They are on the north side of Glacier Divide, from the glacier southwest of Lobe Lakes on the west to the one south of Paine Lake on the east. The name was approved by the BGN in 1972.\" &lt;br&gt;- &lt;b&gt;Peter Browning, &lt;i&gt;Place Names of the Sierra Nevada&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_8\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;External Links&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://www.snwburd.com/bob/trip_reports/matthes_crest_2.html\"&gt;Sept 23, 2000&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://www.snwburd.com/bob/trip_reports/matthes_crest_3.html\"&gt;The full N-S traverse - July 30, 2004&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;                                          &lt;a name=\"chapter_9\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Images&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div align=\"center\"&gt;&lt;table id=\"my_images\"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/the-first-half-of-the-matthes/117048/c-150516\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"The first half of the Matthes...\" src=\"/images/square/117048.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/etsuko-is-checking-out-the/68674/c-150516\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Etsuko is checking out the...\" src=\"/images/square/68674.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/gordon-getting-funky-on-the/86098/c-150516\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\" Gordon getting funky on the...\" src=\"/images/square/86098.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/looking-back-at-the-north/144177/c-150516\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Looking back at the North...\" src=\"/images/square/144177.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/on-the-knife-edge-of-the/1646/c-150516\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"On the knife-edge of the...\" src=\"/images/square/1646.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/riding-the-fin/305420/c-150516\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Riding the Fin\" src=\"/images/square/305420.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/the-matthes-crest-and-the/52183/c-150516\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\" The Matthes Crest and the...\" src=\"/images/square/52183.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/looking-back-at-the-north/116967/c-150516\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Looking back at the North...\" src=\"/images/square/116967.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/dirk-on-top-of-the-south/67787/c-150516\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Dirk on top of the south...\" src=\"/images/square/67787.JPG\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/etsuko-on-the-knife-edge-of/68670/c-150516\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Etsuko on the knife edge of...\" src=\"/images/square/68670.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/beautiful-matthes-lake-with/116966/c-150516\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Beautiful Matthes Lake with...\" src=\"/images/square/116966.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/the-wave-pitch-of-the/62987/c-150516\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\'The \"wave\" pitch of the...\' src=\"/images/square/62987.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/towards-cathedral-and-budd-lake/496185/c-150516\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Towards Cathedral and Budd Lake\" src=\"/images/square/496185.JPG\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/at-the-risk-of-contributing/149887/c-150516\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"At the risk of contributing...\" src=\"/images/square/149887.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td colspan=\"7\" align=\"center\"&gt;[ &lt;a href=\"/matthes-crest/images/p-150516\"&gt;View Gallery - 111 More Images&lt;/a&gt; ]&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/article&gt;date:difficulty:'),(41,150522,'/broads-fork-twin-peaks/150522','/wasatch-range-central/171209','Broads Fork Twin Peaks','','','','11330','',59022,40.5939,-111.72,'Utah, United States, North America','','',171209,'Wasatch Range (Central)','','','','','','Mountain-Rock','content: &lt;article&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_1\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2 id=\"first_h2\"&gt;Overview&lt;/h2&gt;Broads Fork Twin Peaks, more frequently referred to simply as \"Twin Peaks\", is the highest and most prominent mountain on the eastern skyline behind Salt Lake Valley.  With an elevation of 11,330 feet (east summit) and 11,328 feet (west summit), the Twins rise nearly 7,000 vertical feet above the valley floor.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The most commonly used ascent route is via Broads Fork, a class 3 climb of 5,100+ vertical feet with some scrambling and exposure.  More difficult routes can be found in Broads Fork, as well as Deaf Smith Canyon, Ferguson Canyon, Tanners Gulch, Stairs Gulch, and Lisa Falls.  The center of the &lt;a href=\"http://www.fs.fed.us/r4/wcnf/unit/slrd/wilderness/twin_peaks_wilderness.shtml\"&gt;Twin Peaks Wilderness Area&lt;/a&gt;, the peaks here are some of the most rugged to be found in the Wasatch.  Needless to say, the summit views of Salt Lake City and the surrounding Wasatch Mountains are excellent.&lt;br&gt;&lt;div align=\"center\" class=\"image\" style=\"width: 506px;\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"/broads-fork-massif-taken/80739\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Broads Fork massif.

Get there by either Taking I-15 to I-215 east at about 60th south, or take I-80 east to Wasatch Boulevard.  The parking lot fills quickly in the summer months.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Access to Deaf Smith is difficult and threatened by homeowners.  The trail starts at the end of Golden Oaks Drive (just off Wasatch Boulevard) at a dirt road.  Try to park in a manner that does not distrub the home owners.&lt;br&gt;&lt;div align=\"center\" class=\"image\" style=\"width: 506px;\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"/east-summit-view/185521\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"East Summit View\" height=\"375\" width=\"500\" src=\"/images/medium/185521.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=\"caption\"&gt;Summit View Looking West&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_3\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Summary of Routes&lt;/h2&gt;Broads Fork Twin Peaks offers a variety of route options, ranging from relatively straight-forward 3rd class scrambles, to exposed 4th class ridges and steep spring snow climbs.

It looks good from all sides, has expansive views from its class 4 summit block, and the SE Buttress is considered a classic climbing route. John Muir made the first ascent of Cathedral Peak in 1869, possibly the first class 4 climb to be made anywhere in the Sierra.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The &lt;a href=\"http:/mountains/route_link.pl/route_id/193/object_id/392\"&gt;SE Buttress&lt;/a&gt; is an extremely popular route among climbers despite the three mile approach hike, and there is often a line to climb it on weekends. Even during weekdays it is climbed by several parties each day during the summer months. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The peak can be climbed without gear via the Mountaineers Route on the east side, or from the west side. The summit block is rated class 4, a moderate crack with excellent holds, and only about 15 feet high. The summit has enough room to hold four or five climbers if they\'re friendly, though in the past the Sierra Club used to get a dozen members on top at the same time. There used to be a solid anchor installed on top that could be used for rappelling or just for safety for those not comfortable with the exposure. The two bolts were chopped sometime during the summer of 2001, reportedly by YOSAR. Without the bolts the summit can still be protected fairly easily with a few cams. The last person down can be belayed from below by someone stationed on the west side of the summit block. Then flip the rope over the block when down - be careful not to get the rope stuck in the process, or you\'ll have to climb back up to retrieve it (as I did the first time I tried this manuever).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The summit register has long disappeared, and no new one seems forthcoming due to the excessive popularity of this peak (so don\'t waste time like we did looking for one!)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If you have time following a climb of Cathedral Peak, a climb of &lt;a href=\"http://www.summitpost.com/mountains/mountain_link.pl/mountain_id/1064\"&gt;Eichorn Pinnacle&lt;/a&gt; via the &lt;a href=\"http://www.summitpost.com/mountains/route_link.pl/route_id/736/object_id/1064\"&gt;North Face&lt;/a&gt; should not be missed.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A note about the class ratings: Early routes that are rated class 4 are usually indistinguishable from 5.easy. Secor has a short section on this, describing the early 1936 and 1938 versions of the Sierra Club classifications that provided the roots for the Yosemite Decimal System widely used in the US today. In it, he comments, \"A 1936 class 4 covers everything from class 4 to 5.6 today.\" and \"A 1938 class 4 would be class 4 to 5.4 today.\" Cathedral Peak was almost certainly rated in one of these early systems. And of course, in keeping with tradition, ratings are rarely changed once assigned - which is why it\'s important to know something about when and who first rated a route. &lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;table class=\"inline_image_thumbs\"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=23277\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/23277.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=44574\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/44574.JPG\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=2315\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/2315.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=22325\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/22325.JPG\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=116963\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/116963.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_2\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Getting There&lt;/h2&gt;The easiest approach is via the Cathedral Lakes Trailhead in &lt;a href=\"http://www.summitpost.com/mountains/mountain_link.pl?mountain_id=759\"&gt;Tuolumne Meadows&lt;/a&gt;. From either the east or west, take Highway 120 into Yosemite NP and drive to Tuolumne Meadows. The trailhead is located on the west end of the meadow, about a mile west of the visitor center. It is a very busy locale and there are usually a dozen or more cars parked there at any given time during the summer.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;To approach the west side of Cathedral Peak take the JMT south towards Cathedral Lake for about 3.5 miles. Before you reach the lakes, Cathedral and Eichorn Peaks will loom high on the eastern skyline.&lt;br&gt;The approach for the popular SE Buttress (and Mountaineers Route) follows the Budd Creek drainage. There is a fine use trail that can be taken - see the &lt;a href=\"http://www.summitpost.com/show/route_link.pl/route_id/193/object_id/392\"&gt;SE Buttress&lt;/a&gt; page for details.&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;table class=\"inline_image_thumbs\"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=3747\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/3747.JPG\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=13838\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/13838.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=86097\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/86097.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_3\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Red Tape&lt;/h2&gt;Permits are not required for day hikes, but Wilderness permits are required for overnight visits. These can be obtained from any ranger station in the park. The nearest location is the permit building just east of the Tuolmne Meadows campground. It is just off the road that leads to the Tuolumne Lodge, on the right hand side. &lt;br&gt;Because of the camping restrictions on all sides of this peak, it is almost always climbed as a day hike.&lt;br&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_4\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;When To Climb&lt;/h2&gt;Climbing is generally done May-Oct. Before and after this time Highway 120 is closed. There can be much snow on the ground in May and June, so check ahead and plan accordingly if you intend to climb at this time. Late in October the highway is often open but closed to overnight parking - dayhikes to Cathedral Peak can still be done easily. Even in early season when there is much snow on the ground, Cathedral can be approached on snowshoes without much difficulty. The SE buttress is generally free of snow when the road opens in May, so the climbing can be quite nice (and less crowded!).&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;table class=\"inline_image_thumbs\"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=30376\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/30376.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=31469\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/31469.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_5\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Camping&lt;/h2&gt;Camping is not allowed in the Budd Creek drainage on Cathedral\'s east side, nor within 4 miles of the trailhead. If you take the JMT on the west side, you can camp at Cathedral Lakes which just puts you past the 4 mile limit. Be aware that this a popular trailhead, and quotas fill very early. You should plan to be at the Wilderness office in Tuolmne Meadows when it first opens if you want a chance at a permit. With these restrictions most folks climb Cathedral as a day hike. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;You can also camp south of Cathedral Pass, but there is little water nearby for most of the year. Later in the summer, the nearest water on that side of the pass can be found at Echo Lake. This is a nice site if you plan to climb other peaks in the area such as &lt;a href=\"http://www.summitpost.com/mountains/mountain_link.pl?mountain_id=384\"&gt;Matthes Crest&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"http://www.summitpost.com/mountains/mountain_link.pl?mountain_id=291\"&gt;Tresidder Peak&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href=\"http://www.summitpost.com/mountains/mountain_link.pl?mountain_id=430\"&gt;Echo Peaks&lt;/a&gt;. Be aware of that this is a popular campsite for both people and bears.

Hanks, James Hutchings, and Captain Corcoran, representatives of the San Carlos Mining and Exploration Company, while on a trip to the mines near Independence. The peak had first been designated as Cathedral Spires, but the Whitney Survey changed the name to Cathedral Peak. Cathedral Spires and Rocks are now the names of the rock formations opposite El Capitan in Yosemite Valley.\" &lt;br&gt;- &lt;b&gt;Erwin Gudde, &lt;i&gt;California Place Names&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\"The peak was named by the California Geological Survey in 1863. \'From a high ridge, crossed just before reaching this lake [Tenaya], we had a fine view of a very prominent exceedingly grand landmark through all the region, and to which the name of Cathedral Peak has been given ... the majesty of its form and its dimensions are such, that any work of human hands would sink into insignificance if placed beside it.\' (Whitney, Geology, 425.) &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;First ascent by John Muir, September 7, 1869.\" &lt;br&gt;- &lt;b&gt;Peter Browning, &lt;i&gt;Place Names of the Sierra Nevada&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;John Muir\'s route took him up the \"Mountaineer\'s Route\", Class 3 until the summit block which is Class 4: &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\"September 7. --Left camp at daybreak and made direct for Cathedral Peak, intending to strike eastward and southward from that point among the peaks and ridges at the heads of the Tuolumne, Merced, and San Joaquin rivers. Down through the pine woods I made my way, across the Tuolumne River and meadows, and up the heavily timbered slope forming the south boundary of the upper Tuolumne basin, along the east side of Cathedral Peak, and up to its topmost spire, which I reached at noon, having loitered by the way to study the fine trees, --two-leaved pine, mountain pine, albicaulis pine, silver fir, and the most charming, most graceful of all the evergreens, the mountain hemlock. High, cool, late-flowering meadows also detained me, and lakelets and avalanche tracks and huge quarries of moraine rocks above the forests. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;All the way up from the Big Meadows to the base of the Cathedral the ground is covered with moraine material, the left lateral moraine of the great glacier that must have completely filled this upper Tuolumne basin. Higher there are several small terminal moraines of residual glaciers shoved forward at right angles against the grand simple lateral of the main Tuolumne Glacier. A fine place to study mountain sculpture and soil making. The view from the Cathedral Spires is very fine and telling in every direction. Innumerable peaks, ridges, domes, meadows, lakes, and woods; the forests extending in long curving lines and broad fields wherever the glaciers have left soil for them to grow on, while the sides of the highest mountains show a straggling dwarf growth clinging to Glacier Meadow Strewn with Moraine Boulders, 10,000 Feet above the Sea (near Mt. Dana) rifts in the rocks apparently independent of soil. The dark heath-like growth on the Cathedral roof I found to be dwarf snow-pressed albicaulis pine, about three or four feet high, but very old looking. Many of them are bearing cones, and the noisy Clarke crow is eating the seeds, using his long bill like a woodpecker in digging them out of the cones. A good many flowers are still in bloom about the base of the peak, and even on the roof among the little pines, especially a woody yellow-flowered eriogonum and a handsome aster. The body of the Cathedral is nearly square, and the roof slopes are wonderfully regular and symmetrical, the ridge trending northeast and southwest. This direction has apparently been determined by structure joints in the granite. The gable on the northeast end is magnificent in size and simplicity, and at its base there is a big snow-bank protected by the shadow of the building. The front is adorned with many pinnacles and a tall spire of curious workmanship. Here too the joints in the rock are seen to have played an important part in determining their forms and size and general arrangement. The Cathedral is said to be about eleven thousand feet above the sea, but the height of the building itself above the level of the ridge it stands on is about fifteen hundred feet. A mile or so to the westward there is a handsome lake, and the glacier-polished granite about it is shining so brightly it is not easy in some places to trace Front of Cathedral Peak the line between the rock and water, both shining alike. Of this lake with its silvery basin and bits of meadow and groves I have a fine view from the spires; also of Lake Tenaya, Cloud\'s Rest, and the South Dome of Yosemite, Mt. Starr King, Mt. Hoffman, the Merced peaks, and the vast multitude of snowy fountain peaks extending far north and south along the axis of the range. No feature, however, of all the noble landscape as seen from here seems more wonderful than the Cathedral itself, a temple displaying Nature\'s best masonry and sermons in stones. How often I have gazed at it from the tops of hills and ridges, and through openings in the forests on my many short excursions, devoutly wondering, admiring, longing! This I may say is the first time I have been at church in California, led here at last, every door graciously opened for the poor lonely worshiper. In our best times everything turns into religion, all the world seems a church and the mountains altars. And lo, here at last in front of the Cathedral is blessed cassiope, ringing her thousands of sweet-toned bells, the sweetest church music I ever enjoyed. Listening, admiring, until late in the afternoon I compelled myself to hasten away eastward back of rough, sharp, spiry, splintery peaks, all of them granite like the Cathedral, sparkling with crystals, --feldspar, quartz, hornblende, mica, tourmaline. Had a rather difficult walk and creep across an immense snow and ice cliff which gradually increased in steepness as I advanced until it was almost impassable. Slipped on a dangerous place, but managed to stop by digging my heels into the thawing surface just on the brink of a yawning ice gulf. Camped beside a little pool and a group of crinkled dwarf pines; and as I sit by the fire trying to write notes the shallow pool seems fathomless with the infinite starry heavens in it, while the onlooking rocks and trees, tiny shrubs and daisies and sedges, brought forward in the fire-glow, seem full of thought as if about to speak aloud and tell all their wild stories. A marvelously impressive meeting in which every one has something worth while to tell. And beyond the fire-beams out in the solemn darkness, how impressive is the music of a choir of rills singing their way down from the snow to the river! And when we call to mind that thousands of these rejoicing rills are assembled in each one of the main streams, we wonder the less that our Sierra rivers are songful all the way to the sea. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;About sundown saw a flock of dun grayish sparrows going to roost in crevices of a crag above the big snow-field. Charming little mountaineers! Found a species of sedge in flower within eight or ten feet of a snow-bank. Judging by the looks of the ground, it can hardly have been out in the sunshine much longer than a week, and it is likely to be buried again in fresh snow in a month or so, thus making a winter about ten months long, while spring, summer, and autumn are crowded and hurried into two months. How delightful it is to be alone here! How wild everything is, --wild as the sky and as pure! Never shall I forget this big, divine day, --the Cathedral and its thousands of cassiope bells, and the landscapes around them, and this camp in the gray crags above the woods, with its stars and streams and snow.\" &lt;br&gt;- &lt;b&gt;John Muir &lt;i&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://www.sierraclub.org/john_muir_exhibit/writings/my_first_summer_in_the_sierra/\"&gt;My First Summer in the Sierra&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_8\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;External Links&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://www.dankat.com/swhikes/cathed.htm\"&gt;C.E.

Starr King is an impressive granite dome a few miles south of Half Dome in Yosemite National Park. Due to the smooth granite walls that encircle these two peaks, they were declared \"unclimbable\" by Josiah Whitney in the 1860\'s. To prove Whitney wrong, locals climbed both peaks within a decade.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Mt. Starr King is really a series of 3 domes running north-south, the north dome being the high point. The summit is class 5 from all sides, while the other two domes are class 2. The two main routes are the Southeast Saddle and the Northeast Side, with the Southeast Saddle far the more popular route. Because both routes are easy class 5 and can be climbed in a few pitches, they make excellent beginner rock climbs. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Though much less famous than Half Dome, Mt. Starr King is actually the higher of the two. Mt. Starr King lacks the dramatic relief of Half Dome\'s Northwest Face, as well as the nearly 5,000 vertical feet of relief.&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;table class=\"inline_image_thumbs\"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=40706\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/40706.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=16614\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/16614.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=3490\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/3490.JPG\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=9510\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/9510.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=18252\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/18252.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_2\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Getting There&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;br&gt;The closest approach is via the Mono Meadow Trailhead, off the Glacier Point Road. To get there, take Highway 41 to the Glacier Point Road and drive east. The trailhead is on the right side of the road, just after the road turns north to head toward Glacier Point. There is a large dirt parking lot that rarely has more than a few cars. Bear boxes have been installed at the trailhead - put all your extra food there instead of in your car.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://www.summitpost.com/mountains/user_link.pl/user_id/302\"&gt;mpbro&lt;/a&gt; has checked out some alternative approaches using TOPO!: &lt;br&gt;1) Happy Isles to Starr King: +5000\', -not much\', 7 miles one way. &lt;br&gt;2) Glacier Point - Panorama Trail - Starr King: +3500\', -1500\', 8 miles one way. &lt;br&gt;3) Glacier Point - across Illouette bridge - cross country to the Starr King trail: +3500\', -1500\', 6 miles one way. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;These three approaches are all similar, and more mileage and elevation gain than the Mono Meadow TH. With a car shuttle (or using the Valley bus), you could entertain a one way Mono Meadow -&amp;gt; Happy Isle route. This would avoid the 500 foot climb on the return at the cost of extra mileage and shuttle coordination.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;table class=\"inline_image_thumbs\"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=73754\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/73754.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_3\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Red Tape&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;br&gt;$20 fee to enter Yosemite NP. Good for seven days. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Wilderness permits are required for overnight camping. These can be obtained at any Ranger Station in Yosemite.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Check out the &lt;a href=\"http://www.summitpost.com/mountains/mountain_link.pl/mountain_id/987\"&gt;Yosemite Valley&lt;/a&gt; page for a great deal of more information.&lt;br&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_4\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;When To Climb&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;br&gt;Climbing is usually done May-Oct. Before and after this time the Glacier Point Road is closed past the Badger Pass ski area. One can still climb Mt. Starr King when the road is closed, but it adds about 10 miles to the approach. Early in the season the Illilouette Creek is raging and becomes a significant obstacle to cross as there is no bridge.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In the winter, a trip starting at Happy Isle is easiest. Though harder than the summertime hike from Mono Meadow, it can still be done in a long day if snow conditions are favorable. Well consolidated snow on the Northeast Slope can make the climb even easier than it is as a rock climb. Because of its southern exposure, the Southeast Saddle Route can often be free of snow in winter. A good yardstick to use is the &lt;a href=\"http://www.summitpost.com/show/route_link.pl/route_id/79/object_id/221\"&gt;Snake Dike&lt;/a&gt; route on Half Dome - if that route (visible from Yosemite Valley) is free of snow, it is likely the Southeast Saddle on Mt. Starr King is snow-free as well.&lt;br&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_5\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Camping&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;br&gt;Camping is allowed in most areas of the Yosemite Wilderness that surrounds Mt. Starr King, with a valid Wilderness Permit. Camping on the wide summit is possible, providing spectacular sunsets and sunrises. If you hike in late in the afternoon with insufficient time to reach the summit, there are some great bivy sites on the central dome. Both of these camp locations provide excellent protection from bears which roam lower below treeline. &lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;table class=\"inline_image_thumbs\"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=9511\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/9511.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_6\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Mountain Conditions&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://www.nps.gov/yose/\"&gt;NPS Page&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_7\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Etymology&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;br&gt;The dome was named during the Civil War for Thomas Starr King (1824-1864), a Unitarian minister of San Francisco, who was influential in keeping California in the Union. The mountain was known as South Dome before Starr King\'s name became attached to it. The northeast peak of Mount Diablo [Contra Costa Co.], now labeled North Peak, had been named Mount King by Whitney when he, accompanied by King and others, ascended the mountain on May 7, 1862. &lt;br&gt;- &lt;b&gt;Erwin Gudde, &lt;i&gt;California Place Names&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\"On Saturday night [June 22, 1861] at ten o\'clock a flag was raised on T. Starr King\'s church. He is very strong for the Union, and this was a surprise for him on his return from up country. A crowd was in the streets as he returned from the steamer. He mounted the steps, made a most brilliant impromptu speech, and then ran up the flag with his own hand to a staff fifty feet above the building. It was a beautiful flag, and as it floated out on the breeze that wafted in from the Pacific, in the clear moonlight, the hurrahs rent the air -- it was a beautiful and patriotic scene. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Sunday I went to hear him preach. He is a most brillian orator, his language strong and beautiful. He is almost worshiped here, and is exerting a greater intellectual influence in the state than any other two men.\" &lt;br&gt;- &lt;b&gt;William Brewer, &lt;i&gt;Up and Down California&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\"\'Mount Starr King,\' Whitney declared \'is the most symmetrical and beautiful of all the dome-shaped masses around the Yosemite. Its summit is absolutely inaccessible.\' Once again Whitney was wrong, for in 1876 George Bailey, the same who had been with Muir on Mount Whitney the year before, together with a young lawyer named Schuyler, conquered it, \'with the exception of a few branches of spirey needles, the last of Yosemite\'s inaccessibles.\'&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Muir, San Francisco Evening Bulletin, September 6, 1876. Even the \'Spirey needles\' were ultimately climbed.\" &lt;br&gt;- &lt;b&gt;Francis P.

Clark is a striking peak at the north end of the Clark Range in the southern half of Yosemite National Park. It is one of 33  Mountaineer Peaks in the Sierras, so designated because of the excellence of their climbing. All of its routes are challenging, and the Northwest Arete in particular is a stunning sight and a thrilling climb. Due to its central location in the park, Mt. Clark is visible from nearly every other peak in the park. Viewd from Glacier Point, it is the high peak to the left and behind Mt. Starr King to the southeast.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It was first summited in 1866 by Clarence King and James Gardiner of the US Geological Survey via the class 3 Southeast Ridge.&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;table class=\"inline_image_thumbs\"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=7756\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/7756.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=3491\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/3491.JPG\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=64683\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/64683.JPG\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=114895\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/114895.JPG\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_2\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Getting There&lt;/h2&gt;There are a number of possible ways to reach Mt.

There is a large dirt parking lot that rarely has more than a few cars. There are three or four bear boxes available to store food in - don\'t leave food in your car, even if you\'re just out for a day hike.&lt;br&gt;A second approach, more commonly used, is via Happy Isle in Yosemite Valley. This approach is longer in terms of miles (not by much) and elevation gain (+1600\'), but has less cross-country travel and may be faster time-wise. &lt;br&gt;If you are considering starting from Glacier Point and traveling to Mt. Clark via Little Yosemite Valley, note that due to ups and downs along the route you will actually have to gain more elevation on the round trip than starting from Happy Isle (and more miles to boot).&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=\"//www.summitpost.com/mountains/user_link.pl/user_id/302\"&gt; mpbro&lt;/a&gt; points out a third approach via Tenaya Lake that is not as bad as it sounds, but not better than Mono Meadow or Happy Isle.&lt;br&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_3\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Red Tape&lt;/h2&gt;$20 fee to enter Yosemite NP. Good for seven days. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Wilderness permits are required for overnight camping. These can be obtained at any Ranger Station in Yosemite.&lt;br&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_4\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;When To Climb&lt;/h2&gt; Climbing is usually done May-Oct. Before and after this time the Glacier Point Road is closed past the Badger Pass ski area. One can still climb Mt. Clark when the road is closed, but it adds about 10 miles to the approach. With snow on the ground, the already long approach becomes a very arduous undertaking. Early in the season the Illilouette Creek is raging and becomes a significant obstacle to cross as there is no bridge.&lt;br&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_5\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Camping&lt;/h2&gt;Camping is allowed in most areas of the Yosemite Wilderness that surrounds Mt.

The Whitney Survey had named the peak The Obelisk because of its odd shape. Clark\'s Station, a stage stop and home of Clark in the 1860s and 1870s, is now Wawona.\" &lt;br&gt;- &lt;b&gt;Erwin Gudde, &lt;i&gt;California Place Names&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\"Galen Clark (1814-1920), the first guardian of Yosemite State Park (1864), and discoverer of the Mariposa Grove. When in his forties he feared that he was going to die of a lung ailment. He went to the mountains for the sake of his health, built a cabin in the spring of 1857 at what became \'Clark\'s Station\' (now Wawona), and lived another 43 years. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The mountain was once called \'Gothic Peak,\' and later, the \'Obelisk,\' a name given by the Whitney Survey. The name \'Mt. Clark\' appears on the Hoffmann and Gardiner map, 1863-67. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\'Mr. King, who with Mr. Garder, made the ascent of the peak [1866], says that its summit is so slender, that when on top of it they seemed to be suspended in air.\' (Whitney, The Yosemite Guide Book, 1870, 109.)\" &lt;br&gt;- &lt;b&gt;Peter Browning, &lt;i&gt;Place Names of the Sierra Nevada&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\"Galen Clark was one of its [Yosemite] earliest explorers, its first public guardian and one of its most revered hosts, tour guides and protectors for most of his life. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Or for nearly all of his second life, as it were. Clark was 42, a widowed, runaway father of five, chronically ill with lung problems, when he settled alone in a high-country meadow above Yosemite Valley in 1856. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;He had just suffered what he later described as a \'severe attack of hemorrhage of the lungs and was given up to die at any hour.\' So he quit his job as a packer and camp worker for the Mariposa Ditch Co., \'and went to the mountains to take my chances of dying or growing better which I thought were about even.\' &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The mountain environment he chose was alongside the South Fork of the Merced River, where he had camped a year earlier as a pioneer Yosemite tourist. To regain his health, he would surrender himself to nature\'s healing powers in as pristine a setting as he had ever seen. He would go bareheaded and barefoot, fish, hunt, and eat his favorite health food -- roasted deer liver. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It worked. Clark not only got better but lived another 54 years, discovering, studying and naming the Mariposa Grove of Big Trees, exploring Yosemite, greeting and educating its visitors, mediating disputes among its bickering concessionaires, establishing a reputation as a selfless, devoted servant and becoming an expert on the geography, geology and botany of the Yosemite region. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In his earliest, recuperative days, Clark had few visitors except for local Indians who brought him food to help him though his illness. His friendship with the Indians would serve him well in his later duties as Yosemite\'s official guardian, the person who had to enforce the white man\'s administration on people who had been worshiping Yosemite as their home for centuries. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Within a year of setting up his personal therapy camp, Clark decided to live in the mountains full time. He established a 160-acre homestead, built a small log cabin in 1857 and soon he was hosting travelers overnight. Whites called his crude but hospitable inn \'Clark\'s Station,\' and Indians called it Pallahchun, meaning \'A good Place to Stop.\' It was the forerunner of today\'s Wawona Hotel. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;His official duties begon as early as anyone\'s in Yosemite. As Yosemite\'s first official guardian, or resident superintendent, Clark served from 1866 to 1880 during the turbulent and divisive days of private claims in the valley, challenges to the Yosemite commissioner\'s authority, and underfunding from the state. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When he didn\'t get paid -- for six years the Legislature failed to appropriate his $500-a-year salary -- he worked for nothing, maintaining trails and bridges, mediating disputes, enforcing fire precautions and making sure trees weren\'t cut down. ,p&amp;gt; Innkeeping afforded, at best, moderate and, at worst, negative income for Clark, a notoriously poor businessman. He mortgaged his Wawona property four times before selling out in the 1870s and moving with his second wife to Yosemite Valley, where he would be closer to most of the problems the guardian had to face. But before the move and after it, Clark spent most of his time hunting and exploring, building his knowledge of Yosemite and his love for it. His second wife, who probably didn\'t see as much of him as the bears did, was gone by the early 1880s. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;John Muir, who arrived at Yosemite 12 years after Clark, called him \'the best mountaineer I ever met.\' Strangers raved about his hospitality, and in his later years tourists flocked to his nine-seat buggy for rides to points of interest in the park and photographs of Mister Yosemite, the old man with the Santa Claus beard and wearing the rumpled suit. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;He was known as a quiet man, unassuming, respected and respectful, but not one to keep strong opinions bottled up. For example, when Yosemite Valley got its first church, built near his valley home in 1879, Clark wrote in California Farmer magazine: &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\'It seems to me almost like a sacrilege to build a church within the portals of this grandest of all God\'s temples. It is like building a toy church within the walls of St. Peter\'s cathedral at Rome. But it will clearly show the contrast between the frail and puny works of man, as compared with the mighty grandeur and magnificence of the works of God, and I hope it will do good.\' &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Through most of the 1880s Clark ran his tour buggy and continued his hiking, hunting and studying. He was becoming a living legend, entertaining his coach riders with tales of Yosemite and posing for pictures in the Mariposa Grove-- especially in front of the famous Grizzly Giant and in the driver\'s seat of stages as they emerged from the Wawona tree tunneled in 1880. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;He also was digging his own grave -- literally. In 1885, the 71-year-old Clark got the commissioners\' permission to prepare his own spot in the Yosemite Cemetery. He picked an oak-shaded spot, transplanted four young sequoias and for several years improved the site. He dug a well and equipped it with a hand pump to water the trees. Then he trenched 6 feet deep around the grave and dropped in some broken glass to keep gophers from burrowing in. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But he wasn\'t going to get to use it for a while. Clark returned as guardian in 1889 and served another seven years. He was still hiking and riding horses in his 90s, and according to a Mariposa Gazette article until the last few years of his life he could shin up a tree as easily as a boy of 10. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The sequoias at his grave site were 12 years old when Galen Clark, the man who had almost died at the age of 42 but found rejuvenation and purpose at Yosemite, went to sleep for the last time in his daughter\'s home in Oakland in 1910. He was 95.\" &lt;br&gt;-&lt;b&gt;Modesto Bee (online)&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Clarence King and James T. Gardiner made the first ascent of Mt. Clark on July 12, 1866 by the class 4 Southeast Arete: &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\"of all the objects that inspired King\'s enthusiasm, the one that attracted him most was a peak which Whitney and his men called \'The Obelisk\' from its peculiar shape as seen from the north rim [of Yosemite Valley]. It was shortly afterwards named Mount Clark. He longed to climb it, and made up his mind to attempt it \'at all hazards.\' The boundary survey completed, he set out with Cotter on the climbing adventrue. But this time they were not to test their strength and courage upon high-angle rocks. It was November, and the first winter storm struck with full force. They retreated. The field season of 1864 was at an end. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;After an interval in the East and a surveying assignment in Arizona, King returned to Yosemite early in the summer of 1866, eager to renew his explorations. The \'Obelisk\' still fascinated him, and one afternoon in July he and Gardiner made camp \'in the self-same spot where Cotter and I had bivouacked in the storm.\' \'There was in our hope of scaling this point,\' he says, \'something more than a mere desire to master a difficult peak. It was a station of great topographical value, the apex of many triangles, and, more than all, would command a grander view of the Merced region than any other summit.\' The story, told in King\'s best manner in Mountaineering [in the Sierra Nevada], is condensed as follows: \'At gray dawn Gardiner and I were up and cooking our rasher of bacon, and soon had shouldered our instruments and started for the top. At last we struggled up to what we had all along believed to be the summit, and found ourselves only on a minor turret, the great needle still a hundred feet above. From rock to rock and crevice to crevice we made our way up a fractured edge until within fifty feet of the top, and here its sharp angle rose smooth and vertical. One step more and we stood together on a little detached pinnacle, where, by steadying ourselves against the sharp, vertical Obelisk edge, we could rest. About seven feet across the open head of a cul-de-sac (a mere recess in the west face) was a vertical crack riven into the granite not more than three feet wide, but as much as eight feet deep; in it were wedged a few loose boulders; below, it opened out into space. At the head of this crack a rough crevice led to the summit. Summoning nerve, I knew I could make the leap, but the life and death question was whether the debris would give way under my weight, and leave me struggling in the smooth recess, sure to fall and be dashed to atoms. Two years ago we had longed to climb that peak, and now within a few yards of the summit no weak-heartedness could stop us. There was no discussion, but planting my foot on the brink, I sprang, my side brushing the rough projecting crag. The debris crumbled and moved. I clutched both sides of the cleft, relieving all possible weight from my feet. The rocks wedged themselves again, and I was safe. Gardner followed and we sprang up the rocks like chamois, and stood on the top shouting for joy.\' &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It is interesting to compare Gardner\'s account of the same episode: \'Passing the instruments up from one to another, we slowly worked our way up to within a short distance of the summit; then the face we were climbing became perfectly smooth and vertical. We moved along on a little shelf about three inches wide till we got to the edge round which we could look onto the other side of the thin flat wall of granite. Here was our only chance of reaching the summit. A little smooth knob protruded from the precipice face, and beyond it, but out of stepping distance, was a crack in an angle of the rock, and in it two or three loose stones had become jammed. One might possibly step on the knob and by a strong sure jump get half of one foot into the crack and then climb up. We looked at the smooth little knob and wondered if we should slip, and we looked at the trifling foothold at the other end of the perilous leap, and we looked for one instant down the fifteen hundred feet which it overhung. Then we looked at our instruments and thought of the results if we succeeded. It was, I think, duty\'s call that nerved us. That leap, like most dangers, seemed more perilous after it was made than before; it was not the length of the spring -- that was easy -- but to light in exact balance on a projecting rock that scarcely held half of one foot, while the remainder of the body hung over a precipice 1500 ft. deep, was a thing requiring most exact judgment. Another winter\'s frost may break those stones caught in the crack and then Mt. Clark is inaccessible.\' &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Gardner took note of the view in more detail than did King. \'Our view of the southern Sierra,\' he continued, \'was very fine. In the extreme distance, yet clear and prominent, was the double-peaked summit of Kaweah Mountain, always most easily distinguished of the southern group.\' Mount Goddard was visible, and several dark peaks east of it, almost as high. But the peak that seems to have attracted most attention was Mammoth Mountain [not the one presently so called. It probably refers to the Ritter-Banner-Davis-Rodgers group as seen from Mount Clark, before Ritter was singled out for a separate name], which Gardner calls \'one of the most striking peaks in the Sierra, from its great size and from the needle-like pinnacles that rise from a mountain at its souther end. King named them the Minarets.\' &lt;br&gt;- &lt;b&gt;Francis P.

It also could be considered one of the hardest of the Cascades volcanoes when comparing \"standard\" routes. It\'s the oldest and least climbed of the Three Sisters.  First ascent was by H. H. Prouty in 1910 for which the summit pinnacle is named.  Originally thought to be over 11,000 feet, it has eroded and is basically a large pile of loose volcanic rock.  There are two pinnacles at it\'s summit and many gendarmes.  There is also lots of loose rock and rockfall.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Only the easier routes are often climbed.  These include the south and southeast ridges as well as the northwest ridge.  There are two main approaches: the Obsidian Trail approach from the west and the Pole Creek Springs approach from the east. The two south routes meet up and share the same final ridge.  In summer conditions, the traverse to the Bowling Alley, the final summit pitch up a loose, steep gulley, is on a narrow, crumbly, loose rock ledge and the Bowling Alley is Class 4 junk.  Under snowy conditions, the traverse is a steep side-stepping affair around a ridge and the Bowling Alley can be 70-80 degree hard snow or ice.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;To see a 3D topo map showing the Obsidian Trail, click &lt;a href=\"http://zero-kelvin.com/nw2k/3sisters_map.html\"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.  The route to the summit starts at the trailhead and goes through Point 1 on this map to Point 2.  From there you depart the Obsidian Trail and head up the valley and ridge aiming for the point between the two peaks.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For a kinda neat NASA shot of the area click &lt;a href=\"http://vulcan.wr.usgs.gov/Photo/NASA/AnnotatedImages/nasa_hood_sisters_8508.html\"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;To see the volcanic history of the area, click &lt;a href=\"http://vulcan.wr.usgs.gov/Volcanoes/Sisters/description_three_sisters.html\"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div align=\"center\" class=\"image-left\" style=\"width: 506px;\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"/north-sister/770696\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"North Sister\" height=\"375\" width=\"500\" src=\"/images/medium/770696.JPG\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=\"caption\"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div align=\"center\" class=\"image-right\" style=\"width: 341px;\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"/south-sister-summit-view/599864\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"South Sister Summit View\" height=\"500\" width=\"335\" src=\"/images/medium/599864.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=\"caption\"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;table class=\"inline_image_thumbs\"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=60404\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/60404.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=60872\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/60872.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=60408\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/60408.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=84457\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/84457.JPG\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=29410\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/29410.JPG\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_2\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Getting There&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;div align=\"center\" class=\"image-right\" style=\"width: 506px;\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"/david-leads-the-traverse-in/112330\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"David leads the traverse.

The peak has two dominate ridges that meet at the summit to form a large basin or washbowl on its western side.  The peak is also crisscrossed by slides that give is a most dramatic appearance. Even though it looks to be quite a hard peak to get up it is actually one of the more most pleasant mountains to climb in the area.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The normal route up the Ridge Trail is long but not overly steep, it has great sections of exposed rock with some minor scrambling, there are a number of good lookouts along the trail and the summit is mostly bald and offers the best view of the entire great range as well as Whiteface, Easter and the Dix range. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Giant is also famous for its many slides most of witch were formed in one night back in 1963, qhen a great storm cut huge swaths downs its slope. So far there are at least 8 slide routes up its differing faces offering a challenge from class 2 all the way up to true class 5 climbing in some places.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The normal route is up the Rige Trail is an ideal day route for young kids they love the scrambiling and open sections but beware of the look out over the washbowl as it is a sheer 100m drop that can be hard to see at night or in bad weather.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This peak makes a great day trip but in summer bring plenty of warter are there are no safe water sources along the way.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If one takes the Roaring Brook trail  trail back down from the summit (you can link up with the normal route lower down on a cross-over trail at the Washbowl) one will get some impression of what it was like in the dacks before the loggers moved in. In one section there is a vast hemlock forest with truly outstanding trees some 1 or 2 meters in diameter.&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;table class=\"inline_image_thumbs\"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=3381\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/3381.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=3382\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/3382.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=3380\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/3380.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=11332\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/11332.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=33636\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/33636.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_2\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Getting There&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;br&gt;There  is a free parking area on rt 73 about 3.3 miles from Keen valley.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;table class=\"inline_image_thumbs\"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=108558\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/108558.JPG\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=56816\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/56816.JPG\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_3\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Red Tape&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;br&gt;Normal Adirondack rules apply. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This peak is not in the High peaks area so a day permit is not required to climb it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;table class=\"inline_image_thumbs\"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=65028\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/65028.JPG\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_4\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;When To Climb&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;br&gt;Any season is good. &lt;br&gt;Some good sites&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://www.adk46r.org\" target=\"_new\"&gt; ADk 46ers&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://adirondack-hiking.portal-1.com\" target=\"_new\"&gt; Adirondack Hiking Portal&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The trails can be very wet in spring but are dry for the summer.

The simple name Giant is the one that has stuck over time even though it doesn\'t look like a giant when one is actully in the valley.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The first non-native ascent and first ascent of any 4000ft peak in the Adirondacks was by Charles Brodhead during the 1797 military survey.  His party cut its way up the East slope and then down the West and according to most climbers, locals and the guidebook no-one has done it since.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_7\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;External Links&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://adirondacks.netfirms.com\"&gt;Adirondack Trip Reports (including Giant)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_8\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Images&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div align=\"center\"&gt;&lt;table id=\"my_images\"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/giant-mt-greens-lake-champlain/231324/c-150557\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Giant mt.

Although it is not quite the tallest peak in the surrounding few miles, it is by far the most striking. Easy access from the Mosquito Flat trailhead and a variety of interesting climbing routes make this a popular destination. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The peak was named in 1908 by Joseph LeConte, James Hutchinson and Duncan McDuffie, in light of its position at the head of the Hilgard Branch of Bear Creek. One might eagerly anticipate an exciting or amusing story of how the name &ldquo;Bear Creek&rdquo; arose, but alas, if such a story exists it is lost. Bear Creek was a name in common use by sheepmen in the late nineteenth century, but we have no further information on its origin.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The first recorded ascent was in August of 1923, when Hermann Ulrichs climbed the &lt;a href=\"http://www.summitpost.org/show/route_link.pl/route_id/1027/object_id/494\"&gt;route &lt;/a&gt;that now bears his name, and which is the most commonly climbed. That Ulrichs made the ascent solo is entirely in keeping with his character. He climbed alone often, carried a rope, but was uncomfortable with roped climbing. Apparently, he never owned or carried a tent. Ulrichs made the ascent when he was just 21 years of age. He subsequently climbed in Washington, Canada, and the Alps. A pioneering climber in the North Cascades in the 1930&rsquo;s, Ulrichs was an early proponent of what we might call today a &ldquo;pure&rdquo; free climbing ethic. He wrote, &ldquo;I have always felt that the tussle between the peak and me should both be entirely on our [own] resources--not outside aids.&rdquo; Ulrichs was also an advocate of downclimbing routes rather than rapelling, as the way down was the other half of the climb! &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Although Ulrichs&rsquo; name is little known Sierra climbing history, the name of the person to establish the second and third routes on the peak is not. In October 1931 and May 1932 another notorious soloist by the name of Norman Clyde established the &lt;a href=\"http://www.summitpost.org/show/route_link.pl/route_id/5471/object_id/494\"&gt;Northeast Face&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"http://www.summitpost.org/show/route_link.pl/route_id/1011/object_id/494\"&gt;Northeast Buttress&lt;/a&gt; routes, respectively. Since then, several additional routes have been put up, ranging in difficulty from 5.8 to 5.10b. Three of these are on the spectacular south face, which looms over the Granite Park area.&lt;a name=\"chapter_2\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Getting There&lt;/h2&gt;Bear Creek Spire is most readily accessed from the Mosquito Flat trailhead in Little Lakes Valley. There are many back country approaches, but if you\'re contemplating that avenue, I\'ll leave you to your topo maps--I think you know what you\'re doing, and won\'t try to tell you your business. Newcomers to the Eastern Sierra should check out the &lt;a href=\"http://www.summitpost.org/logistical-center/154084/Eastern-Sierra-Logistical-Center.html\"&gt;Eastern Sierra Logistics page&lt;/a&gt;. It provides information on where to stay in the area, restaurants, gear shops, etc. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Little Lakes Valley is reached via paved road off Highway 395. Roughly halfway between Bishop and Mammoth Lakes is the tiny hamlet of Tom\'s Place. Exit the highway here and head south. Follow the main road (there are a couple of turn-offs) to its end. There is ample hiker parking, but the lot can fill up with day users on warm summer weekends. The trail is at the south end of the parking lot, and is well marked. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Rock Creek road is closed seven miles from Tom\'s Place in the winter. California State Parks operates a &lt;a href=\"http://ohv.parks.ca.gov/default.asp?page_id=1233\"&gt;SNO-PARK&lt;/a&gt; there (skiing, snowshoes, but no snowmobiles), with restrooms and overnight parking.

Wilderness permits are required for overnight camping from May 1 through November 1, but not for day hikes. The most common approach is from the Mosquito Flat trailhead between Bishop and Mammoth Lakes. Access from other directions is subject to similar regulation, but details won\'t be provided here. &lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Mosquito Flat trail is subject to &lt;a href=\"http://www.fs.fed.us/r5/inyo/recreation/wild/quotas.shtml\"&gt;quotas&lt;/a&gt;, though. In 2005 the limit was 25 entries per day, with 15 being reservable and the remaining 10 available for walk-in. You can check permit &lt;a href=\"http://www.fs.fed.us/r5/inyo/recreation/wild/otheravail.shtml\"&gt;availability&lt;/a&gt; on the web. The info is usually at least close to up-to-date. Bear canisters are required.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Permit reservations may be obtained by calling (760) 873-2483, by FAX (call the previous # for the FAX number), or by writing to:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Inyo National Forest&lt;br&gt;351 Pacu Lane&lt;br&gt;Suite 200&lt;br&gt;Bishop, CA 93514&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Permits can be picked at the White Mountain Ranger Station in Bishop at:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;798 North Main Street&lt;br&gt;Bishop, CA 93514&lt;br&gt;760-873-2500&lt;br&gt;760-873-2501 TDD&lt;br&gt;Hours: 8:30 am to 4:30&lt;br&gt;Open all year&lt;br&gt;Monday-Friday in winter &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;or at the Mammoth Ranger Station and Visitor Center&lt;br&gt;P.O.

The fine for non-compliance is $75.&lt;a name=\"chapter_5\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;When To Climb&lt;/h2&gt;Bear Creek Spire may be climmbed year-round, though the road is closed seasonally a few miles short of the trailhead from roughly November to April (varies year to year). Little Lakes Valley is a popular winter back country ski area. It is ideal for cross country skiing as well as offering some good, steep drops for skiers and boarders. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Although the Little Lakes Valley is generally low angle, one soon finds oneself in avalanche terrain on the way up to Dade Lake. The &lt;a href=\"http://www.esavalanche.org/\"&gt;Eastern Sierra Avalanche Center&lt;/a&gt; provide excellent avy advisories on nearly a daily basis during the winter months. Their advisories explicitly include the Rock Creek area. Check the advisory, carry beacons, probes and shovels, and travel with caution. &lt;a name=\"chapter_6\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Camping&lt;/h2&gt;The Forest Service lists thirteen campgrounds in the Rock Creek drainage, including on walk-in CG at the trailhead. All but the trailhead CG require a fee of around $15/night. See the FS &lt;a href=\"http://www.fs.fed.us/r5/inyo/recreation/campgrounds.shtml\"&gt;list&lt;/a&gt; for details as well as other campgrounds in the vicinity.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Bear Creek Spire can be done as a day hike, but many parties, especially those contemplating one of the technical routes, prefer to spend the night near the base of the peak. Camping on the trail is allowed anywhere at least 100 feet from water and the trail. The most commonly used camp site is at Dade Lake. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Dade Lake can be reached in two ways. Both routes follow the main trail from Mosquito Flat until the end of Long Lake. Here, a use trail departs at a right angle to the main trail, heading right down a short slope and then skirting the south end of the lake. This trail can be followed to Treasure Lakes, where it peters out. Continue cross-country up canyon and climb the steep, sometimes snow-covered, slope at its head. Dade Lake will be just above and to the left of the top of the slope. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A better route continues up the trail to Gem Lakes, where a use trail is followed directly south up into a talus slope to the left of a large pinnacle. Follow the gully up and then left (west) over old moraines until reaching Dade Lake. I prefer this route because the talus is generally more stable and less steep than the Treasure Lakes approach, and the tedious boulder hop around Treasure Lakes is avoided. Both routes have about the same amount of cross-country travel.&lt;a name=\"chapter_7\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Mountain Conditions&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;noformat&gt;The mountain can be and is climbed at all times of the year. While there is nothing to match the solitude, quiet, and incomparable beauty of the winter, avalanches are a reality. Be prepared for difficult conditions and to assess avalanche potential if you head up in the winter.&lt;p&gt;There are many resources available to find out current conditions in the area:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Staff at the Mammoth Lakes Ranger Station can provide &lt;a href=\"http://www.fs.fed.us/r5/inyo/conditions/index.shtml\"&gt;current conditions&lt;/a&gt;  (though they may be a bit on the conservative side if asked about the need for foul weather gear, crampons, etc.).

It is easily reached in a few hours from the trailhead and is known as one of the most prestine areas in the Sierra Range.  The approach is easy as compared to most other ice climbs in the area, the climbing is enjoyable and never too severe and it can be linked with Mt Conness\' North Ridge to make for a spectacular traverse.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Other less technical routes, such as the Southeast Chute, the Southwest Face and the Northwest Ridge allow hikers and climbers of all skill levels to also enjoy this peak. Spring skiing is also popular on the slopes and chutes of North Peak, as well as those on nearby Mount Conness and the Conness Glacier.&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;table class=\"inline_image_thumbs\"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=40335\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/40335.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=37660\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/37660.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=2337\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/2337.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=29476\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/29476.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=118826\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/118826.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_2\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Getting There&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;From Hwy 395 and the town of Lee Vining:&lt;/b&gt; Turn west on Hwy 120 (Tioga Pass) and continue up the Lee Vining Grade, past Ellery Lake, looking for the turn off to Saddlebag Lake on your right (if you come to the Tioga Pass Resort, you\'ve gone to far.) Turn right (north) toward Saddlebag Lake and continue up the paved/dirt road for two miles to its end at the lake. As one nears the lake, the trailhead parking lot and the group camping area will be the first turn-off on the right. The campground is the second right hand turn-off.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;From Hwy 120 at Crane Flat:&lt;/b&gt; At the Crane Flat Chevron Station, turn left (north) and continue on Hwy 120 through Tuolumne Meadows and out the east Yosemite Park entrance.

At the north end of the Lake, several trails fork off that lead to the many routes of North Peak. &lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;table class=\"inline_image_thumbs\"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=51951\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/51951.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=25937\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/25937.JPG\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=14580\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/14580.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=14581\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/14581.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=65193\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/65193.JPG\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_3\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Current Weather Conditions&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Useful Weather Links&lt;/b&gt; (use your \"back\" button to return to the North Peak main page)&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://www.mammothweather.com/\"&gt;mammothweather.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://vulcan.wr.usgs.gov/Miscellaneous/WeatherRoads/framework.html\"&gt;USGS Weather &amp;amp; Road Conditions&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://www.srh.noaa.gov/data/forecasts/CAZ073.php?warncounty=CAC051&amp;amp;city=lee+vining\"&gt;NOAA Weather Service&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://www.mgordonphotography.com/sierra/sierra_return.htm\"&gt;The best web-site for general Eastern Sierra information&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_4\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;When To Climb&lt;/h2&gt;From Spring skiing, to climbing the ice couloirs in the Fall, North Peak and the surrounding areas offer numerous adventures for the backcountry traveler during most of the year.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When the Tioga Pass road opens in Spring, skiers travel crosscountry to ski the slopes and chutes of North Peak. Later, when the Saddlebag lake road opens, climbers and hikers can more easily access the the peak for rock/snow scrambles and snow climbs up the couloirs. In late Summer and Fall, when the snow in the couloirs has hardened into alpine ice, climbers have relatively easy access to some of the finest moderate ice climbs in the High Sierra.&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;table class=\"inline_image_thumbs\"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=71854\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/71854.JPG\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=125183\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/125183.JPG\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=104599\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/104599.JPG\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=14578\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/14578.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=73681\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/73681.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_5\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Red Tape&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;1)&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;Camping and camp fires are prohibited&lt;/b&gt; in the &lt;b&gt;Harvey Monroe Hall Research Natural Area&lt;/b&gt;, which includes the Conness Lakes basin and extends approximately two miles east from the White Mountain crest/Yosemite Park boundary.&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;2)&lt;/b&gt; Permits are &lt;b&gt;not required for day use&lt;/b&gt; and there is &lt;b&gt;no trailhead quota&lt;/b&gt; in effect for this area.&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;3)&lt;/b&gt; Wilderness permits &lt;b&gt;are required&lt;/b&gt; for overnight visits to the &lt;a href=\"http://sierranevadawild.gov/wildernesses/Hoover_Wilderness.htm\"&gt;Hoover Wilderness&lt;/a&gt;.

Unfortunately the summit, like many others in the Adirondacks, is a bit of a letdown after this great open ridge. A simple long rise and then dip and another short rise with a cairn on top of it.  On the plus side there are great views in all directions.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The normal route for Rocky Peak Ridge is to start from the E up and over Blueberry Cobbles and Bald Peak and then along the open ridge to the summit.  Another approach is to climb up Giant first from the W or N and then head over on the ridgeline E to this peak.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Unfortunately this peak does not have a circle route so one is either has to back-track along the trail or use two cars one at each trailhead. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;table class=\"inline_image_thumbs\"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=24647\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/24647.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=24651\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/24651.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=24654\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/24654.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=24644\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/24644.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_2\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Getting There&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;br&gt;The E trailhead starts at the large parking lot on rt. 9  about 5 miles N of the Junction with Rt. 73 and 1.5 miles S of the New Russia Post office.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;See the entry on &lt;a href=\"http://www.summitpost.com/mountains/mountain_link.pl/mountain_id/435\"&gt;Giant&lt;/a&gt; to get the location for the W Trailhead.&lt;br&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_3\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Red Tape&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;br&gt;Normal Adirondack rules apply. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Parking is normally never a problem but it can be a popular peak in the summer and fall so come early.&lt;br&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_4\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;When To Climb&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;br&gt;The best season is early fall or late spring as there are absolutely no water sources along the trail and it is exposed to the sun along its entire distance. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;On a hot summers day this trail can be quite brutal and there have been many instances of heat stroke and dehydration by people trying to climb it with out water.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This is a great climb for kids of all ages just make sure you bring lots to drink.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The pond near the summit is stagnant and undrinkable and is known to have Giardiasis or as we call it here Beaver Fever. Drink from it only if the water is boiled for 10 mins.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In winter the trail can have some very dramatic snow effects with the odd small and harmless cornice forming along the leaward side of the ridge.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_5\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Camping&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;br&gt;Normal Adirondak rules apply&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;1) No Camping above 4,000 feet&lt;br&gt;2) No camping withing 150 feet of a stream or other water source except at a designated campsite.&lt;br&gt;3) No soap or washing withing 150 feet of water&lt;br&gt;4) Pack it in Pack it out is the rule for garbage&lt;br&gt;5) Only dead and down wood can be used for fires and set in a proper fire pit.

It basically exposed a &ldquo;Great Rocky Ridge&rdquo; which because of its dense underbrush was largely ignored up until this time.  The term &ldquo;Peak&rdquo; most likely got inserted some time after this. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The fire made for much easier access to both it and Giant, so much so that until only a few dozen years ago there were regular horse rides going to the summit of Rocky Peak Ridge and near to the summit of Giant.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Evidence of this fire can still be seen by the openness of the area, the short secondary growth near the start of the W approach trail and if one is so inclined by digging down a few inches in some areas one will still find charred wood and ash.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_8\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Images&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div align=\"center\"&gt;&lt;table id=\"my_images\"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/looking-west-towards-rocky/24647/c-150701\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Looking west towards Rocky...\" src=\"/images/square/24647.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/giant-and-rpr-from-pyramid/204129/c-150701\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Giant and RPR from Pyramid\" src=\"/images/square/204129.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/the-green-mountains-from-rocky-peak-ridge/463704/c-150701\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"The Green Mountains From Rocky Peak Ridge\" src=\"/images/square/463704.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/adirondacks/450346/c-150701\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Adirondacks\" src=\"/images/square/450346.JPG\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/this-is-the-view-looking-east/24651/c-150701\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"This is the view looking east...\" src=\"/images/square/24651.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/adirondacks/450344/c-150701\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Adirondacks\" src=\"/images/square/450344.JPG\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/waterfalls-along-trail/583550/c-150701\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"waterfalls along trail\" src=\"/images/square/583550.JPG\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/adirondacks/450348/c-150701\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Adirondacks\" src=\"/images/square/450348.JPG\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/adirondacks-greens/450360/c-150701\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Adirondacks &amp;amp; Greens\" src=\"/images/square/450360.JPG\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/adirondacks/450364/c-150701\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Adirondacks\" src=\"/images/square/450364.JPG\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/lake-marie-louise-from-rocky/130274/c-150701\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"lake marie louise from rocky...\" src=\"/images/square/130274.JPG\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/rocky-ridge-peak-from/130273/c-150701\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"rocky ridge peak from...\" src=\"/images/square/130273.JPG\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/valley-colors-and-high-peaks/233338/c-150701\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Valley Colors and High Peaks\" src=\"/images/square/233338.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/ledges-and-leaves/233339/c-150701\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Ledges and Leaves\" src=\"/images/square/233339.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td colspan=\"7\" align=\"center\"&gt;[ &lt;a href=\"/rocky-peak-ridge/images/p-150701\"&gt;View Gallery - 26 More Images&lt;/a&gt; ]&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/article&gt;date:difficulty:'),(50,150794,'/mount-tukuhnikivatz/150794','/la-sal-mountains/190208','Mount Tukuhnikivatz','','','','12482','',26865,38.4394,-109.259,'Utah, United States, North America','','',190208,'La Sal Mountains','','','','','','Mountain-Rock','content: &lt;article&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_1\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2 id=\"first_h2\"&gt;La Sal Mountains Overview&lt;/h2&gt;Click to see an &lt;a href=\"http://www.summitpost.com/mountains/photo_link.pl/p/photo_id__61055__object_id__661__type__mountain__mountain_id__661__route_id____user_id____order_by____limit__\"&gt;Overview Photo&lt;/a&gt; of the La Sal Mountains. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The La Sals are a small mountain range in eastern Utah covering an area 25 miles long (north-south) by 15 miles wide (east-west). They are, however, Utah\'s second highest range (after the Uintas) and contain twelve peaks higher than 12000 ft (highest point: Mt. Peale 12721 ft). With their lush forests and cool summer temperatures, they are in sharp contrast to the hot, arid canyonlands of eastern Utah and provide an excellent background for the dramatic scenes of Arches and Canyonlands National Parks. Two high passes, La Sal Pass (10125 ft) and Geyser Pass (10538 ft) divide the mountains into three distinct groups: north, middle and south. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;North has seven 12ers: &lt;br&gt;Rank....................Peak &lt;br&gt;4...........................Mt.

This name probably stems from the fact that Tukuhnikivatz rises very abruptly on the western margin of the La Sal Mountains. From the town of Moab, Mt. Tukuhnikivatz appears as a steep triangular peak that seems to rise above the rest of the mountains. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Mt. Tukuhnikivatz has been traditionally climbed from La Sal Pass to the south. This route will take you up steep slopes (and loose scree just below the summit). An approach from the north, via Gold Basin, is also possible (see Routes). To the east, a 1.75 mile long ridgeline that drops to a minimum elevation of 11700 ft, connects Mt. Tukuhnikivatz to Mt. Peale. A traverse of this ridgline will take you past the &lt;a href=\"http://www.summitpost.com/show/route_link.pl/route_id/1696/object_id/330\"&gt;\"Razor Fang\"&lt;/a&gt; which has been rated as the most difficult route in the La Sal Mountains. To the northwest, the slopes of Tukuhnikivatz create a 12048 ft sub-peak that is known as Little Tuk or Tukuhnikivatz North.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;From the summit, you will have great views of the red arid canyonlands of Utah to the west. The rest of the La Sal mountains can be seen to the north, east and south. The Abajo Mountains (highest point 11360 ft) appear as broad ridges rising above the canyonlands 40 miles to the southwest. You will even get a glimpse of the Henry Mountains 75 mile away.&lt;br&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_3\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Getting There&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://www.summitpost.org/mountains/photo_link.pl/p/photo_id__121448__object_id__700__type__mountain__mountain_id__700__route_id____user_id____order_by____limit__\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"http://www.summitpost.org/images/original/80180.jpg\" and width=\'350\"\'&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"http://www.summitpost.org/mountains/photo_link.pl/p/photo_id__59127__object_id__700__type__mountain__mountain_id__700__route_id____user_id____order_by____limit__\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"http://www.summitpost.org/images/original/30884.JPG\" and width=\'350\"\'&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Tukuhnikivatz (R), Mellenthin (L)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The mountains are easily accessible from the town of Moab (elevation 4000 ft). La Sal Pass can be reached from the west via a high clearance four wheel drive road. The easier route, however, is from the east as follows:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;From downtown Moab drive 22 miles south on Route 191 to State Route 46. Turn east on Route 46. The road skirts the southern tip of the mountains and goes to their east side. At 35 miles from Moab, turn left/north onto Canopy Gap Road (a good dirt road). After two miles turn left onto La Sal Creek Road (passable by most any car). Drive the road 8 miles climbing the eastern slopes of the mountains through forests of Aspen to La Sal Pass (10125 ft).(The only obstacle is a creek crossing at 2 miles into La Sal Creek Rd which may present a problem for low clearance vehicles during high run-off). Don\'t be surprised to find cows roaming freely and blocking the road. At the pass, you can look north to see Mt. Peale and Tukuhnikivatz. To the south, you will find South Mountain (11817 ft). La Sal Pass is the trailhead for both Peale and Tukuhnikivatz. Hiking distance is 2.2 miles to the summit of Tukuhnikivatz.&lt;br&gt;&lt;div align=\"center\" class=\"image\" style=\"width: 506px;\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"/mount-tukuhnikivatz/627172\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Mount Tukuhnikivatz\" height=\"351\" width=\"500\" src=\"/images/medium/627172.JPG\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=\"caption\"&gt;L to R: Mt.

Recommended routes: Moon Goddess Arete (III 5.7), Sun Ribbon Arete (IV 5.9....which features a Tyrolean traverse, Dark Star (V 5.10 A0).....all five star routes. Get an early start on Sun Ribbon Arete (20 pitches) and Dark Star (26 pitches)!! See R.J.

Once in town, head west up to the Glacier Lodge trailhead and park at roads end. If you fall short logistically, the &lt;a href=\"http://www.395.com/glacierlodge/\"&gt;Glacier Lodge&lt;/a&gt; store/resturant has a few \"amenaties\" (hops and barley, porkrinds and greasy sliders are the norm).  Take the North Fork trail of Big Pine Creek up to Third Lake (approx 7 miles). There are fairly good bivy sites scattered around the lake. If taking an approach line around the eastern side of Third Lake, use caution in the talus field of Mt. Alice (slides occur often!). Upon summiting, take the southeastern descent to Contact Pass and return to Third Lake. Better yet.....have some fun and glissade!!&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;table class=\"inline_image_thumbs\"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=42479\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/42479.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=39067\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/39067.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=32881\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/32881.JPG\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=37681\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/37681.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_3\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Red Tape&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;br&gt;A wilderness permit can be obtained from the Inyo National Forest Ranger Station in Lone Pine. As a word of caution, the east side trailhead quotas get \"gobbled up\" quick. Plan on obtaining a permit in advance through the National Forest Service by email or reservation service by photo.

It has been known to snow in the middle of July, so prepare for inclimate weather when the cirrus clouds appear! There have been parties that have done winter ascents but the Palisades area seems to get the brunt of any cold front! &lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;table class=\"inline_image_thumbs\"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=14624\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/14624.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=14623\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/14623.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=68650\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/68650.JPG\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=68667\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/68667.JPG\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_5\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Camping&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;br&gt;Camping is permitted only with a wilderness permit issued. If you intend on building a campfire, obtain a fire permit as well. The National Forest Service is considering the North Pal and Middle Pal as watersheds. Take your chances on the summit. The Sierras are famous for thunderstorms and lightning!&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;table class=\"inline_image_thumbs\"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=122315\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/122315.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_6\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Mountain Conditions&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;br&gt;The best way to get current weather conditions is to call the Inyo Ranger Station or &lt;a href=\"http://www.climbingsource.com/usaweathermap.html\"&gt;Sierra eastside weather conditions&lt;/a&gt; in order to get the most accurate weather forecasts. As far as the rock goes, Temple Crag is one of the more solid monoliths in the eastern Sierras. Routes between Venusian Blind Arete and Temple Crag\'s North Buttress features high quality granite; fissured and blocky. There are a few loose sections between aretes. Eclipsed Arete and the routes to it\'s left are known for loose rock on the initial pitches and loose blocks around the final gendarmes...keep a good head about your shoulders and a vigilant belayer. Better yet, use a helmet!&lt;br&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_7\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Miscellaneous Info&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;br&gt;The summit register is under a large cairn (6 feet!!), where Sun Ribbon finishes. If you find weathered slings at the escape descents, replace them.  And as the norm goes, pick up and pack out any trash.......even if it\'s not yours. A lot of trash has been found in the notch above the third gendarme of Sun Ribbon Arete (tape, Capri Sun juice box, cigarette butts and ......a condom?!?)&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;table class=\"inline_image_thumbs\"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=43816\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/43816.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_8\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;KUDOS!!&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;br&gt;My personal thanks goes out to &lt;a href=\"http://www.summitpost.org/mountains/user_link.pl?user_id=972\"&gt;rpc&lt;/a&gt; and his wife Shirley for the fabulous photos shots of Moon Goddess Arete and their many useful suggestions. Their contributions have made this page a better resource for SP member and climbers in general. I also want to personally thank &lt;a href=\"http://www.summitpost.org/mountains/user_link.pl/user_id/4920\"&gt;Alois Smrz&lt;/a&gt; for his insight and alpine wisdom. As a respected climber who has put up several FA\'s in the Sierra, Alois has always been a source of inspiration and a pillar of knowledge. Kudos to you all!

It\'s a bit of a sandbag. From the stream crossing at the east end of Third Lake, follow a climbers trail up to the top of the moraine. Then proceed about a quarter of a mile, more or less in the direction of the North Buttress, as if you were heading up to Contact Pass.  Just when the situation seems completely hopeless, you will emerge from the huge talus into a sandy area. Don\'t stop too soon. It just gets bigger and flatter. If you camp here, make sure there is either snow to melt or bring ample water, as otherwise you will go thirsty. It is also possible to proceed a few hundred vertical feet higher towards Contact Pass, where another large sandy area suitable for camping can be found. Again, make sure there is snow, or bring your own water.&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td valign=\"bottom\" style=\"padding-top: 6px;\" colspan=\"2\"&gt;&lt;span style=\"font-size: 9px; color: #888;\"&gt;Posted Nov 4, 2004 11:29 pm&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;table border=\"0\" width=\"775\" class=\"messages\"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td width=\"110\" align=\"left\" valign=\"top\" style=\"padding-top: 6px;\"&gt;&lt;a name=\"121038\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a class=\"dis_user_lnk\" href=\"/users/rpc/794\"&gt;rpc&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td valign=\"top\" style=\"padding-top: 6px;\"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Untitled Comment&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td align=\"right\" valign=\"top\" nowrap style=\"font-size: 10px;\"&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td valign=\"top\" rowspan=\"2\" align=\"left\" style=\"padding-top: 6px;\"&gt;&lt;p class=\"disc_avatar\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"/users/rpc/794\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"rpc\" width=\"50\" height=\"50\" border=\"0\" src=\"/images/avatars/484610.JPG\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=\"font-size: 9px; color: #888;\"&gt;Voted 10/10&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td colspan=\"2\" style=\"padding-top: 6px;\"&gt;Dave,&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r&lt;br&gt;Thank you very much for the kind words and thank you for putting up one of our shots as sig. photo for the page (I just saw this).

I wanted to say maybe the recommendation of Moon Goddess should drop down a notch (or many notches) since it seems to be particularly loose lately.  I had been hearing this from everyone I mentioned it to all summer, so I went up to take a look yesterday by climbing it.  Although it was certainly climbable (i\'m still in one piece after completing it) I was constantly marveling at how loose and ready-to-go a lot of the rock was.  My exact thought at the time was \"wow, i wouldn\'t come back and repeat this, even with a rope or two\".  Too much danger to the rope, too much danger to the second, too much danger potentially &lt;i&gt;caused by&lt;/i&gt; the rope.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r&lt;br&gt;What I\'m saying is, right now, I would not recommend MGA to any friend of mine, or even an unfriend.  I would gladly share beta on it and discuss it thoroughly if someone asked me about it, but I wouldn\'t begin a general discussion of Temple Crag by using MGA as my first example in a list of classic \"five star\" routes to climb there.  It\'s also notable that Peter Croft rates it merely \"good\" while he rates Venusian \"awesome\".  I agree, any loose terrain on Venusian is much more reasonable/manageable than some of what Moon Goddess currently provides.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r&lt;br&gt;What do you think?  Maybe if enough others agree, MGA could be featured less prominently in the intro paragraph to this page.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r&lt;br&gt;There\'s this one contributing psychological factor too.  A lot of climbers look upon Temple Crag for the first time, naturally they say \"wow, let\'s do a route on that!\" -- \"well, which one?\" ... they look in the book and a natural first pick for a great number of climbers would be the one route that is frequently rated 5.8: Moon Goddess in this case.  5.8 just seems to be one of the most attractive grades that a great number of climbers want to climb in alpine settings.  Manageable but challenging, etc.  The majority (note I\'m only talking about a numerical/statistical majority here, not everyone or our best friends or any other measure) don\'t want to climb Sun Ribbon or Dark Star their first time without a partner who\'s done it before.  They also don\'t want to feel like they\'re doing the easiest 5th-class route on the peak.  So they gravitate directly to Moon Goddess.  And from the ridiculous amount of unstable rock I saw yesterday, I have to say that this is like a numerical gun pointing at their heads.  I\'m curious how others feel about this.&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td valign=\"bottom\" style=\"padding-top: 6px;\" colspan=\"2\"&gt;&lt;span style=\"font-size: 9px; color: #888;\"&gt;Posted Aug 12, 2005 9:56 pm&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;table border=\"0\" width=\"775\"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;table cellpadding=\"2\" cellspacing=\"2\" width=\"100%\"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;&lt;span class=\"pagertext\"&gt;Viewing: &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;-&lt;b&gt;5&lt;/b&gt; of &lt;b&gt;5&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td align=\"center\"&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td align=\"right\"&gt;    &lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_11\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Images&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div align=\"center\"&gt;&lt;table id=\"my_images\"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/temple-crag-over-2nd-lake/211867/c-150844\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Temple Crag Over 2nd Lake\" src=\"/images/square/211867.JPG\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/temple-crag-december/470721/c-150844\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Temple Crag, December\" src=\"/images/square/470721.JPG\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/temple-crag/737083/c-150844\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Temple Crag\" src=\"/images/square/737083.JPG\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/temple-crag/682609/c-150844\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Temple Crag\" src=\"/images/square/682609.JPG\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/temple-crag-second-lake/42479/c-150844\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Temple Crag &amp;amp; Second Lake,...\" src=\"/images/square/42479.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/temple-crag-and-glacial-milk/314188/c-150844\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Temple Crag and Glacial Milk\" src=\"/images/square/314188.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/moon-goddess-arete/68677/c-150844\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Moon Goddess Arete\" src=\"/images/square/68677.JPG\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/temple-crag/436407/c-150844\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Temple Crag\" src=\"/images/square/436407.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/keith-following-on-a-short/112480/c-150844\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Keith following on a short...\" src=\"/images/square/112480.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/temple-crag/316768/c-150844\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Temple Crag\" src=\"/images/square/316768.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/temple-crag-from-third-lake/901618/c-150844\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Temple Crag from Third Lake\" src=\"/images/square/901618.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/temple-crag-from-second-lake/213429/c-150844\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Temple Crag from Second Lake\" src=\"/images/square/213429.JPG\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/temple/887677/c-150844\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Temple\" src=\"/images/square/887677.JPG\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/a-view-into-second-lake-from/39067/c-150844\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"A view into Second Lake from...\" src=\"/images/square/39067.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td colspan=\"7\" align=\"center\"&gt;[ &lt;a href=\"/temple-crag/images/p-150844\"&gt;View Gallery - 168 More Images&lt;/a&gt; ]&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/article&gt;date:difficulty:'),(52,150862,'/mount-tamalpais/150862','/marin-county-mountains-ridges-and-hills/826882','Mount Tamalpais','Hiking, Sport Climbing, Toprope, Bouldering, Scrambling','','','2571','',44090,37.928,-122.591,'California, United States, North America','','',826882,'Marin County Mountains,  Ridges and Hills','','','','Spring, Summer, Fall, Winter','','Mountain-Rock','content: &lt;article&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_1\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2 id=\"first_h2\"&gt;Overview&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mount Tamalpais is the most popular outdoors playground in San Francisco Bay Area. It is also the high point of Marin County, California. The mountain is a east-west trending ridge rising dramatically over the surrounding cities and hills, about 10 miles as crow flies north of San Francisco. It has steep slopes on all sides, bounded on the west and south by sea cliffs. From most parts of the mountain there are simply stunning views of the ocean, bay, cities, bridges, rocky outcrops, dense forests, wild flowers, water falls, dramatic ocean cliffs, beaches, pounding surf, fog clouds, sunsets, ...      &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mount Tamalpais has three summits, the West, Middle, and East Peaks. The &lt;a href=\"http://www.topozone.com/map.asp?lat=37.92399&amp;amp;lon=-122.59588&amp;amp;size=l&amp;amp;u=4&amp;amp;datum=nad27&amp;amp;layer=DRG\"&gt;west peak&lt;/a&gt; was the highest point until it was leveled to build a weather station (its geodesic dome resembles a golf ball). The &lt;a href=\"http://www.topozone.com/map.asp?lat=37.92905&amp;amp;lon=-122.5766&amp;amp;size=l&amp;amp;u=4&amp;amp;datum=nad27&amp;amp;layer=DRG\"&gt;east peak&lt;/a&gt; has the best views of the skyline of San Francisco, so it has always been the focal point of tourists. Near the end of 19th century, a cog railroad was built to take tourists to the top of East Peak. Now removed, the railroad path is the \"Old Railroad Grade\", the easiest and most popular route to the summit from the south. The old railroad station at the summit is now a parking lot for tourists who drive to the top (well, about 300 vertical feet below East Peak). There is a snack bar and visitor center there, as well as picnic facilities. From here it is a very crowded and very short hike to the top of East Peak. The poor summit ambience is compensated by spectacular views in every direction. There are also well-used technical rock climbing routes directly below on huge rock outcrops.    &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Commonly called \"Mount Tam\", this is the birthplace of mountain biking. A confusing maze of trails criss-cross the mountain, some designated for bicycles and equistrians and some exclusively for hikers. It is possible to find solitude on the mountain if you hike the north slope and choose the less popular trails. The maze of trails means it is easy to get lost without a good trail map, however, usually you\'ll be able to find someone to ask within an hour.     Being the most popular outdoors playground, there are myriad recreational pursuits here, for example, redwood forest walks (&lt;b&gt;Muir Woods National Monument&lt;/b&gt; on southwest slope), beaches and coastal hiking (Muir Beach, Marin Headlands, Stinson Beach), hang gliding (off Bolinas Ridge on the northwest), fishing (several man-made lakes in the north foothills). Mount Tamalpais extends south into &lt;b&gt;Marin Headlands&lt;/b&gt;, a series of coastal cliffs even more popular for sight-seeing tourists because of the close-up views of the Golden Gate Bridge and San Francisco.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;table class=\"inline_image_thumbs\"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=5424\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/5424.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=90840\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/90840.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=5233\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/5233.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=5234\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/5234.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=92518\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/92518.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_2\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Getting There&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are many trailheads, the most popular ones are:  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;table cellpadding=\"2\"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;  1. Town of Mill Valley - two trailheads, one on West Blithedale Ave just north of Lee Street (300 feet, the beginning of Old Railroad Grade), or the end of Summit Ave (turn left on Fern Canyon Drive and go to the end, elevation 1000 feet). These are the traditional south side access points.  &lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;  2. Panoramic Highway - numerous roadside trailheads, these are the most popular access points from the south. To get to Panoramic Highway follow sign from Highway 1. The main trailheads are at Pantoll Ranger Station (1499 feet), the official entrance to Mount Tamalpais State Park, and Mountain Home Inn (900 feet).  &lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;  3. Muir Woods National Monument - elevation 200 feet. It is possible to do a through-hike from Muir Woods to East Peak, crossing Panoramic Highway at Mountain Home Inn.  &lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;  4. Town of Stinson Beach - the west side approach from the ocean is a long hike if your goal is the East Peak, however, most people only go as far as Rock Springs / Mountain Theatre (elevation 2000 feet) on the west shoulder of the mountain. Two main trailheads: one is at the Fire House in Stinson Beach, the other is on Highway-1 1 mile south of the first intersection with Panoramic Highway (400 feet).   &lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;  5. Alpine Lake - a remote trailhead on the northwest side of the mountain (600 feet), at the west end of Alpine Lake on Fairfax-Bolinas Road. Take Fairfax-Bolinas Road from downtown Fairfax and proceed west for a very winding 8 miles. Accesses the Cataract Creek Trail which features waterfalls in spring. You can go as far as Rock Springs, or continue to East Peak.  &lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;  6. Lagunitas Lake - the more popular north side approach (800 feet elevation) near the town of Fairfax. Take Fairfax-Bolinas road from downtown Fairfax, then follow sign to Lagunitas Park.  &lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;  7. Phoenix Lake - another north side approach (200 feet), near the town of Ross. Take Lagunitas Road off Sir Francis Drake Blvd in Ross. Go to the end and enter Phoenix Lake Park.  &lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;  8. Town of Kentfield - this east side approach is at the end of Evergreen Drive in Kentfield (600 feet).  &lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;  &lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;table class=\"inline_image_thumbs\"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=5345\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/5345.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=5145\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/5145.JPG\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=5224\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/5224.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=9831\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/9831.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=15402\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/15402.JPG\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_3\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Public Transportation&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The more popular parts of the mountain are well served by &lt;b&gt;public transit&lt;/b&gt; (&lt;a href=\"http://www.transitinfo.org/Outdoors/Mount_Tamalpais.html\"&gt;Golden Gate Transit District buses&lt;/a&gt;) on weekends and holidays.&lt;br&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_4\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Red Tape&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mount Tamalpais is criss-crossed by different jurisdictional boundaries: &lt;b&gt;Mount Tamalpais State Park&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;Golden Gate National Recreation Area&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;Muir Woods National Monument&lt;/b&gt;, Marin Municipal Water District, Audubon Canyon Ranch, Marin County Parks and Open Space Preserves.  If you park at the East Peak parking lot there is a daily fee of $5. The Lagunitas Lake trailhead has a $5 daily parking fee.&lt;br&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_5\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;When To Climb&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Any time of the year. To avoid the crowds, go on a windy winter day, you will get far-ranging views. To appreciate wild flowers and water falls, go in spring. Usually the mountain is never too hot or too cold, it can be somewhat windy near the summits. &lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;table class=\"inline_image_thumbs\"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=91437\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/91437.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=80686\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/80686.JPG\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_6\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Camping&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Camping in designated campgrounds, fees and reservation required.

The high point of Contra Costa County, Mount Diablo is about 25 miles east-northeast of San Francisco. It is shaped like a volcano with two high summits (North Peak is 3557 feet) tapering down to the surrounding hills, which are all below 2000 feet. It is said that the view from the top of Mount Diablo covers 40 counties, and is the world\'s second most far-ranging view, after &lt;a href=\"http://www.summitpost.com/mountains/mountain_link.pl/mountain_id/17\"&gt;Mount Kilimanjaro&lt;/a&gt; of Africa. Conversely, Mount Diablo is visible from many, many places, especially on the inland side where the land is vast and flat. As a result its summit is the primary point of reference for land surveying in California, the Mount Diablo Meridian.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Mount Diablo is a popular biking, hiking, horse riding, camping, and sight-seeing destination. There is a 15 mile-long winding road that reaches the summit, where there is a visitor center building and observation deck. The paved road plays host to numerous road biking races. There are many trails criss-crossing the mountain, most are fire roads through rolling grassy terrain with open views and accessible to mountain bikes. Steeper terrain are found on the southwest (for example the sandstone outcrops at \"Rock City\") and northeast flanks of the mountain. &lt;a href=\"http://www.topozone.com/map.asp?lat=37.89317&amp;amp;lon=-121.89927&amp;amp;size=l&amp;amp;u=4&amp;amp;datum=nad27&amp;amp;layer=DRG\"&gt;North Peak&lt;/a&gt; (3557 feet), located 2 miles to the northeast of the main peak, is inaccessible to automobiles, and is seldom visited. It features very steep terrain with lots of rock outcrops, ideal for scrambling.&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;table class=\"inline_image_thumbs\"&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=5231\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/5231.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=82894\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/82894.JPG\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=9745\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/9745.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=10387\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/10387.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=10440\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/10440.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_2\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Getting There&lt;/h2&gt;The following are the main trailheads. There are several others that are in residential neighborhoods in the surrounding towns.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;1. South entrance: Take Diablo Road from Interstate 680 at the town of Danville. This is the traditional approach. Follow signs to Mount Diablo State Park. You can drive all the way to the top from here.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;2. North entrance: Take Walnut Ave off Ygnacio Valley Road in the town of Walnut Creek; follow signs to Mount Diablo State Park. You can drive all the way to the top from here.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;3. North - Mitchell Canyon trailhead (700 feet elevation) : Take Mitchell Canyon Road off Clayton Road in the town of Clayton, go to the end. There is a ranger station here (parking fee charged). Mitchell Canyon Road is a popular bike trail that climbs to the summit in 13 miles.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;4. North - Regency Road trailhead (500 feet elevation): Take Regency Road off Marsh Creek Road in the town of Clayton, go to the end and park on the side of street (free). This trailhead accesses Donner Canyon and Back Canyon. Both canyons lead to the main peak or north peak in 6 miles through steep trails, however bicyclists can follow Donner Canyon Road for a longer ride to the summits.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;5. Northeast - Marsh Creek Road trailhead (900 feet elevation): This is an unsigned, gated turn-off on Marsh Creek Road, east of the town of Clayton. Take Marsh Creek Road until it reaches its highest saddle, then park on the right. A pair of high voltage power lines crosses the road close to it. This trailhead accesses the Mt Olympia Trail, the steepest trail in the park.&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;table class=\"inline_image_thumbs\"&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=6491\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/6491.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=19209\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/19209.JPG\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=25308\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/25308.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=17932\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/17932.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=82904\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/82904.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_3\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Red Tape&lt;/h2&gt;Entrance fee to Mount Diablo State Park is $10 daily, collected at the North and South entrances.&lt;br&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_4\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;When To Climb&lt;/h2&gt;Avoid summers for the oppressive heat.

On a digital elevation model, simply trace straight rays at all (reasonable) azimuths and elevations from the summit of interest to obtain a map like this: &lt;a href=\"http://sepwww.stanford.edu/sep/morgan/research/topo/yosemite/yosemite-valley-2by3-halfdome-visibility.gif\"&gt;Half Dome&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r&lt;br&gt;Of course, this approach ignores haze and other atmospheric events (curving rays), and also ignores the earth\'s curvature (easy to correct for) but you get a pretty good idea of what\'s going on.&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td valign=\"bottom\" style=\"padding-top: 6px;\" colspan=\"2\"&gt;&lt;span style=\"font-size: 9px; color: #888;\"&gt;Posted Nov 15, 2003 1:28 pm&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;table border=\"0\" width=\"775\" class=\"messages\"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td width=\"110\" align=\"left\" valign=\"top\" style=\"padding-top: 6px;\"&gt;&lt;a name=\"16595\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a class=\"dis_user_lnk\" href=\"/users/gordonye/361\"&gt;gordonye&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td valign=\"top\" style=\"padding-top: 6px;\"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Untitled Comment&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td align=\"right\" valign=\"top\" nowrap style=\"font-size: 10px;\"&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td valign=\"top\" rowspan=\"2\" align=\"left\" style=\"padding-top: 6px;\"&gt;&lt;p class=\"disc_avatar\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"/users/gordonye/361\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"gordonye\" width=\"50\" height=\"50\" border=\"0\" src=\"/images/avatars/251792.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=\"font-size: 9px; color: #888;\"&gt;Hasn\'t voted&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td colspan=\"2\" style=\"padding-top: 6px;\"&gt;Morgan, very nice exercise. You can calculate visibility areas with a standard GIS software like ArcInfo. However, the crux of the problem is obtaining enough digital elevation model data to cover all visible areas. This is very difficult as the visible areas can be 200+ miles in radius, which means a high resolution dataset of the area will be huge. Using a smaller dataset you\'ll always miss a few distant peaks.&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td valign=\"bottom\" style=\"padding-top: 6px;\" colspan=\"2\"&gt;&lt;span style=\"font-size: 9px; color: #888;\"&gt;Posted Nov 19, 2003 12:16 pm&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;table border=\"0\" width=\"775\" class=\"messages\"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td width=\"110\" align=\"left\" valign=\"top\" style=\"padding-top: 6px;\"&gt;&lt;a name=\"76593\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a class=\"dis_user_lnk\" href=\"/users/gordonye/361\"&gt;gordonye&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td valign=\"top\" style=\"padding-top: 6px;\"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Untitled Comment&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td align=\"right\" valign=\"top\" nowrap style=\"font-size: 10px;\"&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td valign=\"top\" rowspan=\"2\" align=\"left\" style=\"padding-top: 6px;\"&gt;&lt;p class=\"disc_avatar\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"/users/gordonye/361\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"gordonye\" width=\"50\" height=\"50\" border=\"0\" src=\"/images/avatars/251792.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=\"font-size: 9px; color: #888;\"&gt;Hasn\'t voted&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td colspan=\"2\" style=\"padding-top: 6px;\"&gt;Yes, these are endemic plants on Mt Diablo; the names of quite a few native plants carry the name of the mountain.&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td valign=\"bottom\" style=\"padding-top: 6px;\" colspan=\"2\"&gt;&lt;span style=\"font-size: 9px; color: #888;\"&gt;Posted May 26, 2005 7:50 pm&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;table border=\"0\" width=\"775\" class=\"messages\"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td width=\"110\" align=\"left\" valign=\"top\" style=\"padding-top: 6px;\"&gt;&lt;a name=\"120180\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a class=\"dis_user_lnk\" href=\"/users/diggler/453\"&gt;Diggler&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td valign=\"top\" style=\"padding-top: 6px;\"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Untitled Comment&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td align=\"right\" valign=\"top\" nowrap style=\"font-size: 10px;\"&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td valign=\"top\" rowspan=\"2\" align=\"left\" style=\"padding-top: 6px;\"&gt;&lt;p class=\"disc_avatar\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"/users/diggler/453\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Diggler\" width=\"50\" height=\"50\" border=\"0\" src=\"/images/avatars/816079.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=\"font-size: 9px; color: #888;\"&gt;Hasn\'t voted&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td colspan=\"2\" style=\"padding-top: 6px;\"&gt;Gordon,&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r&lt;br&gt;I\'ve heard the claim before that Diablo has one of the country\'s farther ranging views.

On a digital elevation model, simply trace straight rays at all (reasonable) azimuths and elevations from the summit of interest to obtain a map like this: &lt;a href=\"http://sepwww.stanford.edu/sep/morgan/research/topo/yosemite/yosemite-valley-2by3-halfdome-visibility.gif\"&gt;Half Dome&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r&lt;br&gt;Of course, this approach ignores haze and other atmospheric events (curving rays), and also ignores the earth\'s curvature (easy to correct for) but you get a pretty good idea of what\'s going on.&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td valign=\"bottom\" style=\"padding-top: 6px;\" colspan=\"2\"&gt;&lt;span style=\"font-size: 9px; color: #888;\"&gt;Posted Nov 15, 2003 1:28 pm&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;table border=\"0\" width=\"775\" class=\"messages\"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td width=\"110\" align=\"left\" valign=\"top\" style=\"padding-top: 6px;\"&gt;&lt;a name=\"120255\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a class=\"dis_user_lnk\" href=\"/users/gordonye/361\"&gt;gordonye&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td valign=\"top\" style=\"padding-top: 6px;\"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Untitled Comment&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td align=\"right\" valign=\"top\" nowrap style=\"font-size: 10px;\"&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td valign=\"top\" rowspan=\"2\" align=\"left\" style=\"padding-top: 6px;\"&gt;&lt;p class=\"disc_avatar\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"/users/gordonye/361\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"gordonye\" width=\"50\" height=\"50\" border=\"0\" src=\"/images/avatars/251792.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=\"font-size: 9px; color: #888;\"&gt;Hasn\'t voted&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td colspan=\"2\" style=\"padding-top: 6px;\"&gt;Morgan, very nice exercise. You can calculate visibility areas with a standard GIS software like ArcInfo. However, the crux of the problem is obtaining enough digital elevation model data to cover all visible areas. This is very difficult as the visible areas can be 200+ miles in radius, which means a high resolution dataset of the area will be huge. Using a smaller dataset you\'ll always miss a few distant peaks.&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td valign=\"bottom\" style=\"padding-top: 6px;\" colspan=\"2\"&gt;&lt;span style=\"font-size: 9px; color: #888;\"&gt;Posted Nov 19, 2003 12:16 pm&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;table border=\"0\" width=\"775\" class=\"messages\"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td width=\"110\" align=\"left\" valign=\"top\" style=\"padding-top: 6px;\"&gt;&lt;a name=\"121159\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a class=\"dis_user_lnk\" href=\"/users/nartreb/18713\"&gt;nartreb&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td valign=\"top\" style=\"padding-top: 6px;\"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Untitled Comment&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td align=\"right\" valign=\"top\" nowrap style=\"font-size: 10px;\"&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td valign=\"top\" rowspan=\"2\" align=\"left\" style=\"padding-top: 6px;\"&gt;&lt;p class=\"disc_avatar\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"/users/nartreb/18713\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"nartreb\" width=\"50\" height=\"50\" border=\"0\" src=\"/images/avatars/898272.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=\"font-size: 9px; color: #888;\"&gt;Hasn\'t voted&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td colspan=\"2\" style=\"padding-top: 6px;\"&gt;Unless there\'s another Mt Diablo nearby, this mountain is in the news this week as the home of the thought-to-be-extinct &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://www.berkeley.edu/news/media/releases/2005/05/24_buckwheat.shtml\"&gt;Mount Diablo Buckwheat&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td valign=\"bottom\" style=\"padding-top: 6px;\" colspan=\"2\"&gt;&lt;span style=\"font-size: 9px; color: #888;\"&gt;Posted May 26, 2005 6:48 pm&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;table border=\"0\" width=\"775\" class=\"messages\"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td width=\"110\" align=\"left\" valign=\"top\" style=\"padding-top: 6px;\"&gt;&lt;a name=\"121160\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a class=\"dis_user_lnk\" href=\"/users/gordonye/361\"&gt;gordonye&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td valign=\"top\" style=\"padding-top: 6px;\"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Untitled Comment&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td align=\"right\" valign=\"top\" nowrap style=\"font-size: 10px;\"&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td valign=\"top\" rowspan=\"2\" align=\"left\" style=\"padding-top: 6px;\"&gt;&lt;p class=\"disc_avatar\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"/users/gordonye/361\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"gordonye\" width=\"50\" height=\"50\" border=\"0\" src=\"/images/avatars/251792.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=\"font-size: 9px; color: #888;\"&gt;Hasn\'t voted&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td colspan=\"2\" style=\"padding-top: 6px;\"&gt;Yes, these are endemic plants on Mt Diablo; the names of quite a few native plants carry the name of the mountain.&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td valign=\"bottom\" style=\"padding-top: 6px;\" colspan=\"2\"&gt;&lt;span style=\"font-size: 9px; color: #888;\"&gt;Posted May 26, 2005 7:50 pm&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;table border=\"0\" width=\"775\" class=\"messages\"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td width=\"110\" align=\"left\" valign=\"top\" style=\"padding-top: 6px;\"&gt;&lt;a name=\"139096\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a class=\"dis_user_lnk\" href=\"/users/scott-fulton/17773\"&gt;Scott Fulton&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td valign=\"top\" style=\"padding-top: 6px;\"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Summit Trail closed on 7/2/06&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td align=\"right\" valign=\"top\" nowrap style=\"font-size: 10px;\"&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td valign=\"top\" rowspan=\"2\" align=\"left\" style=\"padding-top: 6px;\"&gt;&lt;p class=\"disc_avatar\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"/users/scott-fulton/17773\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Scott Fulton\" width=\"50\" height=\"50\" border=\"0\" src=\"/images/avatars/226929.JPG\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=\"font-size: 9px; color: #888;\"&gt;Hasn\'t voted&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td colspan=\"2\" style=\"padding-top: 6px;\"&gt;As of July 2nd, 2006, the Summit Trail was closed at the South Gate Entrance due to landslides.

The crags are a granite formation that was formed over 170 million years ago and thrust into the Klamath Mountains geological province during the Jurassic era. These granite formations are in stark contrast to the volcanic and sedimentary nature of the Klamath Mountains province that includes nearby &lt;a href=\"http://www.summitpost.com/mountains/mountain_link.pl/mountain_id/2\"&gt;Mount Shasta&lt;/a&gt;. Both Castle Dome and other rock formations offer striking views, however, exfoliation means that some of the rock is prone to peeling and crumbling making for a bad climb. This and the relatively remote nature of the crags wrt the SF Bay Area means that most rock climbers will travel to Yosemite, leaving visitors here with a sense of peace, tranquility, and striking views. Climbers and hikers will receive impressive views of the Crags and Mount Shasta as well as the heavily wooded valley in between. Winter allows you to travel over fields of snow while spring brings wildflowers such as indian rhubarb, tiger lily, pitcher plant, yellow monkey flower, cycladenia, yarrow, aster and eriogonum. The crags are also home to the Castle Crags hairbell (Campanula shetleri), unique to this area.  &lt;p&gt;  The easiest way to reach the summit is via the 2.7 mile YDS class 1 Castle Dome Trail (aka Crags Trail) which passes the Pacific Crest Trail (PCT) 0.5 miles from the trailhead (2,600 feet). In another 1.5 miles you will run into the 0.2 mile spur trail to Indian Springs, the only source of water on the route. On the way up you will catch glimpses of Shasta and the obvious Castle Dome, the prominent granite formation closest to Shasta. At 4300 feet the trail will switch back against some rock formations, passing Six Toe Rock, and begin a gentle ascent to the base of the crags passing Mount Hubris to the left and continue up the ridge northeast to the obvious base of Castle Dome (4,700 feet).

Falling is unlikely given dry conditions and adequate boot tread, but if you did fall the handholds are small enough that you probably would not be able to stop yourself in certain areas (probably why \"conventional wisdom\" rates this as class 4).  &lt;p--&gt;  NOTE on Books: The John R. Soares book really only has a description of how to get there (driving) and the approach hike. The Laird Davis book has descriptions of the technical 5th class routes. Neither book describes the \"Regular Route.\"&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;table class=\"inline_image_thumbs\"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=5289\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/5289.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=5290\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/5290.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=21793\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/21793.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=5292\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/5292.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=5295\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/5295.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_2\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Getting There&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;br&gt;In Northern California, take I-5 to the Castella (also labelled Castle Crags if you are heading north) exit 48 miles north of Redding and 6 miles south of Dunsmuir (also south of Mount Shasta). Turn west once you get off I-5 following signs for Castle Crags State Park which will appear on your right shortly. Once you pay the entrace fee, take the road to the left of the entrace station up to and through the campgrounds to the trailhead. There\'s an outhouse and animal-resistant garbage can here. The trail is by where the road enters the parking lot, not at the end of the lot.  &lt;p&gt;  For public transportation, &lt;a href=\"http://www.greyhound.com\"&gt;Greyhound buses&lt;/a&gt; will take you to Dunsmuir from where you will need to hitch a ride, hire a taxi, or walk.&lt;br&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_3\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Red Tape&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;br&gt;ENTRANCE / PARKING FEE: While the crags proper are in the Castle Crags Wilderness run by Shasta-Trinity National Forest, access is via California\'s Castle Crags State Park. There is a $6 / day per vehicle use parking fee to enter the state park. Additional fees may apply if you wish to camp (see Camping section).  &lt;p&gt;  WILDERNESS PERMIT: These are required to enter the wilderness area where the rock formations are, however, during the winter months, this isn\'t heavily enforced. Contact the Castle Crags State Park or Mount Shasta Ranger Station listed under the Mountain Conditions section for information on these permits.&lt;br&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_4\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;When To Climb&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;br&gt;Year round and whenever you are in the vincinity to climb Shasta.

There appears to be one or two make-shift campsites, one with a fire ring as of February 2002.    A bit farther away, you can find many motels in nearby towns of Dunsmuir and Mount Shasta. You can also sleep in your car at the nearby I-5 rest areas.&lt;br&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_6\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Mountain Conditions&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;br&gt;Use the following resources to check for conditions on Castle Crags Wilderness and State Park:  &lt;p&gt;  MOUNT SHASTA RANGER STATION&lt;br&gt;204 W.

It ranks as the twenty-first tallest peak in California, and it has a strong presence in the Palisades region.  Situated as the first mountain to the southeast of Bishop Pass, Mount Agassiz sits back to back on a ridge with a number of 13,000 foot peaks and five of the state&rsquo;s 14ers.  The two mile long ridge to the south includes &lt;a href=\"http://www.summitpost.org/mount-winchell/151010\"&gt;Mount Winchell&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"http://www.summitpost.org/thunderbolt-peak/150222\"&gt;Thunderbolt Peak&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"http://www.summitpost.org/starlight-peak/150505\"&gt;Starlight Peak&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"http://www.summitpost.org/north-palisade/150406\"&gt;North Palisade&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"http://www.summitpost.org/polemonium-peak/150513\"&gt;Polemonium Peak&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"http://www.summitpost.org/mount-sill/150410\"&gt;Mount Sill&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Palisades are considered one of the best alpine climbing locations in the Sierra Nevada.  This area hosts a variety of challenging rock climbs and other considerable scrambles during the summer months.  During the winter on the other hand, the Palisades offer expert and extreme ski descent possibilities on a number of couloirs.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Mount Agassiz makes for an excellent overnight climb, sometimes climbed with nearby &lt;a href=\"http://www.summitpost.org/mount-goode/151070\"&gt;Mount Goode&lt;/a&gt; on the other side of Bishop Pass.  It is also done in a strenuous day as the South Lake Trailhead begins at relatively high elevation (9,800 feet).  The most utilized routes up Mount Agassiz are moderate scrambles with class 2-3 rock leading to views in all directions of alpine lakes, high peaks, and one mile to the south of the largest glacier in the Sierra Nevada.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;noformat&gt; &lt;table class=\"inline_image_thumbs\"&gt; &lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=437039\" rel=\"nofollow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/437039.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=450511\" rel=\"nofollow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/450511.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=81814\" rel=\"nofollow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/81814.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=438615\" rel=\"nofollow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/438615.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=29603\" rel=\"nofollow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/29603.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=218833\" rel=\"nofollow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/218833.JPG\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/noformat&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_2\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Getting There&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;div align=\"center\" class=\"image-right\" style=\"width: 206px;\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"/mount-agassiz/223097\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Mount Agassiz\" height=\"125\" width=\"200\" src=\"/images/small/223097.JPG\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=\"caption\"&gt;Agassiz from Bishop Pass Trail&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div align=\"center\" class=\"image-left\" style=\"width: 139px;\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"/mt-agassiz/315679\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Mt.

There are many scenic alpine lakes encountered on the approaches, all making excellent overnight destinations.  Saddlerock Lake and Bishop Lake are great options and well situated for the West Slope route.  Dusy Basin is also available for those seeking a bit more solitude.  If climbing routes to the east there are many options including any of the Big Pine Lakes, Sam Mack Meadow or Sam Mack Lake, and several tarns around Mount Agassiz or the Palisade Glacier.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If completing a daytrip, dispersed camping is allowed in Inyo National Forest, including a handful of areas along or just off Highway 168 from Bishop to South Lake. Even better, there are literally hundreds of roadside camping options in Buttermilk Country, located off Buttermilk Road (north of Highway 168). There are outstanding views of Mount Humphreys, Basin Mountain, Mount Tom, and White Mountain Peak from throughout the area.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Established campgrounds are abundant along the road to South Lake and in the immediate vicinity of both the South Lake and Glacier Lodge trailheads.  There are also additional options nearby further up Highway 168 en route to Lake Sabrina.

He was born in Switzerland, came to the United States in 1846, and became a professor of zoology at Harvard in 1848. Lilbourne A. Winchell, in 1879, gave the name \'Agassiz Needle\' either to this peak or to what is now Mount Winchell, a truly needlelike peak 0.7 mile southeast of Mount Agassiz. (Winchell, 160.) The name change from \'Agassiz Needle\' to \'Mount Agassiz\' was proposed by the Sierra Club in the 1930s. (SC records in BL.) The name \'Agassiz Col\' first appeared on the 1948 Mt.

It is the second highest peak in the Ritter Range, very close to its bigger neighbor &lt;a href=\"http://www.summitpost.com/mountains/mountain_link.pl/mountain_id/363\"&gt;Mount Ritter&lt;/a&gt;, 200 feet taller. Compared to Ritter, Banner Peak is much slimmer with a sharp profile; it is surrounded by 1500-2000 feet high vertical cliffs except on its southwest side. Banner Peak is most photogenic from the northeast: it seems to be floating on the vast 2-mile wide waters of Thousand Island Lake, while bulky Mount Ritter is hidden from view. However, photo ops from Shadow Lake make for an impressive panaramic view of both Ritter and Banner. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The easiest route to Banner Peak is class 2 from the Ritter-Banner saddle ascending its southwest slope. The saddle can be approached from Lake Catherine on the west side (class 2, but longer) or from Ediza Lake on the east side (class 3). The west side of  the saddle is a steep snow chute at all times of the year. In early season (through July) it may be a simple manner of kicking steps when the snow is soft. Later in the season (Sept-Oct) it can be icy and a bit more imposing. If going by the Ritter-Banner Saddle from the east side, the route steepen to 3rd class as the snow gully narrows. Conditions vary in the late season (Sept-Oct) as in most cases the snow runnels out and makes for slushy conditions in the afternoon.  Rock fall is always present and vigilance is required. Routes on Banner Peak\'s other faces and buttresses are much more challenging. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Although not as popular as Mount Ritter, Banner Peak is still frequently climbed. The surrounding wilderness area is one of the most popular backpacking destinations in California, comparable to Yosemite National Park. In fact, at one time this whole area was part of Yosemite, but was detached in 1905 due to conflicting issues over mineral rights in the area. Though many claims were made and many sites worked, no significant ore deposits have ever been recovered from the area.&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;table class=\"inline_image_thumbs\"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=42480\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/42480.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=13662\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/13662.JPG\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=78006\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/78006.JPG\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=6885\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/6885.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=6907\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/6907.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_2\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Getting There&lt;/h2&gt;Banner Peak shares the same access points with Mount Ritter. The closest trailhead is Agnew Meadows, elevation 8200 feet. From Agnew Meadows, take Shadow Lake Trail to Banner-Ritter\'s east side, or Thousand Island Lake Trail to Banner\'s north or west sides. To get to Agnew Meadows, take SR203 west from US395, passing the town of Mammoth Lakes, then the Mammoth Mountain ski area main lodge. Past Minaret Summit access is restricted in summer from 7:00a to 7:00p. See the Red Tape section for details. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;An alternative approach is via Rush Creek Trail from the Silver Lake trailhead. This is a lower trailhead (7000 feet elevation) and involves a longer approach if you\'re ascending Banner\'s east side. Going for Banner\'s north and west sides the length of approach from Silver Lake is similar to Agnew Meadows. Besides, there are no access restrictions at this trailhead. To get to Silver Lake, take SR158 from US395 north of Mammoth Lakes.&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;table class=\"inline_image_thumbs\"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=78008\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/78008.JPG\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=116970\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/116970.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_3\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Red Tape&lt;/h2&gt;Lots of Red Tape. SR203 west of the Minaret Summit(designated \"Reds Meadow Valley\") has travel restrictions due to the narrow one-lane road (in many sections) and the limited parking available at the popular national monument. Travel by car into the area is unrestricted before 7:00a and after 7:00p, so try to plan your trip accordingly. Between these hours it is required that you take the shuttle bus which leaves every 30 minutes, and more frequently during periods of high use (buses will accomodate backpacks). If you want to do a loop starting at Agnew and returning to Devils Postpile, you can ride the shuttle for free back to Agnew Meadows. Once your vehicle is in the area, you are free to exit anytime of day, but you will be subject to the $7 per-person charge if you haven\'t previously paid the fee and the entrance station is manned. (Handy Helps: Upon exiting, turn left just before the booth, heading toward Minaret Vista. Get a minutes worth of awe-inspiring views of the Minarets or turn right just up the lane (50 yards) and head out the entry lane (which is NOT a \"one way\" road). This avoids stopping at the booth altogether! The trick is not to get caught..... &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But, if you have the dough to throw around, the entry fee into Reds Meadow Valley is $7 per person, which allows free use of the shuttle. National Parks Pass and USFS Adventure Passes are not valid here. The fee is used to pay for and encourage the use of the shuttle bus.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Overnite stays in the Ansel Adam Wilderness require free backcountry permits. These can be obtained from the &lt;a href=\"http://www.fs.fed.us/r5/inyo\"&gt;Inyo National Forest website&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;On the more popular trails (Thousand Island Lake, Shadow Lake, Minaret Lake, etc.) camp fires are not permitted and camping is restricted to designated areas. On popular summer weekends the quota for permits may run out, so advance reservation is advised (fee apply). &lt;br&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_4\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;When To Climb&lt;/h2&gt;All year, depending on whether you want to climb on snow, ice, or bare rock. The Ritter Range peaks are composed principally of dark volcanic rocks, and are known to have much loose rock. For some, climbing on snow is preferred. During winter and spring the road beyond Minaret Summit is closed, so a longer approach is involved. The most popular climbing season is summer.&lt;br&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_5\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Camping&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Back country camping&lt;/b&gt; in Ansel Adams Wilderness requires a permit. Camp fires are not allowed along most trails in this area, and camping location may be restricted (around Thousand Island Lake, Garnet Lake, Ediza Lake, etc.) See the Red Tape section. To protect your food from black bears, bear canisters are recommended.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Along SR203 there are many &lt;b&gt;fee campgrounds&lt;/b&gt;, the closest ones are Agnew Meadows, Upper Soda Springs, Minaret Falls, Pumice Flat, Devil\'s Postpile, and Reds Meadow. &lt;b&gt;Commercial lodging&lt;/b&gt; are available in the town of Mammoth Lakes and at the Mammoth Mountain Ski Area.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If you\'re approaching from Silver Lake trailhead, there are also many fee campgrounds along SR158, such as Silver Lake, Gull Lake, Reversed Creek, June Lake, etc. The village of June Lake has commercial lodging available.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_6\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Etymology&lt;/h2&gt;\"Named in 1883 by Willard D.

Winchell is located in the Palisade region of the Sierra Nevada. To access the eastern routes drive to the end of the road in Glacier Canyon (Big Pine Creek). Follow the north fork (of Big Pine Creek) past first, second, and third lakes.  When you come to the junction with the Sam Mack Meadows trail follow that trail to the meadows.  Climb any of the chutes that leaves the meadows and head toward the Thunderbolt Glacier.  Mount Winchell is  to the north of Thunderbolt Peak.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The access to the western routes on Mount Winchell can be achieved by taking Bishop Pass to the Dusy Basin area.  To get there, one takes the South Lake Road which leaves Highway  168 approximately  fifteen miles from Bishop.  From the trailhead at South Lake the trail climbs gradually to join the junction with the Treasure Lakes trail at one mile (10,240 feet).  The Bishop Pass Trail goes left and continues to climb.  After this the trail follows the eastern aspect  of the picturesque Long Lake.  After passing Saddlerlock and Bishop Lake, many switchbacks lead to the summit of Bishop Pass (11,960 feet).  Then one descends into Dusy Basin which is the stepping off point to the western aspect of Winchell&lt;br&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_3\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Red Tape&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;br&gt;Permits are required.

From the east, it looks like a huge, solitary granite tooth.  The east and north sides of the peak present some challenging rock climbs, while the west and south sides offer slightly easier routes to the summit.  Scenic views down to the Mammoth Lakes and out to the Ritter Range and SE Yosemite can be had from the summit.  One of the nice things about Crystal Crag is that it has a very short approach hike and yet still offers enough challenge for most people.&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;table class=\"inline_image_thumbs\"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=8811\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/8811.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=63335\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/63335.JPG\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=8815\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/8815.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=8818\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/8818.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=63309\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/63309.JPG\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_2\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Getting There&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;br&gt;Crystal Crag is located just SE of Lake George, in the Mammoth Lakes area.  To get to Mammoth Lakes, take US 395 south from Reno (3hrs) or north from the LA area (7 hrs), and exit at CA 203 (this junction is well marked).  Follow CA 203 up the hill in the town of Mammoth Lakes until you reach the intersection of Lake Mary Road and Minaret Road.  Go straight on Lake Mary Road for about 4 miles.  Follow the signs to Lake George.  The trailhead (Crystal Lake Trail) is well marked and has ample parking.  &lt;a href=\"http://www.r5.fs.fed.us/inyo/graphics/recmtoj.jpg\"&gt;Click here&lt;/a&gt; for an area map.&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;table class=\"inline_image_thumbs\"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=8813\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/8813.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=94789\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/94789.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=94790\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/94790.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_3\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Red Tape&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;br&gt;No permits required.

The spectacular views from the summit of this mountain are owing to it\'s relatively isolated location at the southern end of a ridge separating the Merriam Lake basin from the Royce Lakes basin.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Other worthwhile objectives around the Royce Lakes Basin are the spectacular and technically difficult  &lt;a href=\"http://www.summitpost.org/show/mountain_link.pl/mountain_id/1325\"&gt;Feather Peak&lt;/a&gt;, the intricate and enjoyable &lt;a href=\"http://www.summitpost.org/show/mountain_link.pl/mountain_id/2108\"&gt;Spire Peak&lt;/a&gt;, and the easy, centrally located &lt;a href=\"http://www.summitpost.org/show/mountain_link.pl/mountain_id/2107\"&gt;Peak 12,563\'&lt;/a&gt;, which has stunning 360* views.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;table class=\"inline_image_thumbs\"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=29044\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/29044.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=87109\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/87109.JPG\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=26973\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/26973.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=86151\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/86151.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=22856\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/22856.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_2\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Routes&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;noformat&gt;&lt;table width=\"540\" border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"4\" cellspacing=\"4\"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td bgcolor=\"e0e0e0\" align=\"center\"&gt;&lt;b&gt;ROUTE&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td bgcolor=\"e0e0ff\" align=\"center\"&gt;&lt;b&gt;TYPE&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td bgcolor=\"e0ffff\" align=\"center\"&gt;&lt;b&gt;DIFFICULTY&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td bgcolor=\"e0ffe0\" align=\"center\" width=\"64\"&gt;&lt;b&gt;PHOTO&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td bgcolor=\"f6f6f6\" align=\"center\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://www.summitpost.org/northeast-ridge-face/161862\"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Northeast Ridge/Face&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td bgcolor=\"f6f6ff\" align=\"center\"&gt;Scramble&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td bgcolor=\"f6ffff\" align=\"center\"&gt;Class 4&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td bgcolor=\"f6fff6\" align=\"center\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://www.summitpost.org/mountains/photo_link.pl?photo_id=103052&amp;amp;object_id=1139&amp;amp;type=mountain&amp;amp;mountain_id=1139&amp;amp;route_id=3712\"&gt;&lt;img width=\"60%\" src=\"http://www.summitpost.org/images/thumb/65567.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td bgcolor=\"f6f6f6\" align=\"center\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://www.summitpost.org/northwest-ridge/157900\"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Northwest Ridge&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td bgcolor=\"f6f6ff\" align=\"center\"&gt;Scramble&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td bgcolor=\"f6ffff\" align=\"center\"&gt;Class 2+&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td bgcolor=\"f6fff6\" align=\"center\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://www.summitpost.org/mountains/photo_link.pl/p/photo_id__158764__object_id__1139__type__mountain__mountain_id__1139__route_id____user_id____order_by____limit__\"&gt;&lt;img width=\"60%\" src=\"http://www.summitpost.org/images/thumb/108252.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td bgcolor=\"f6f6f6\" align=\"center\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://www.summitpost.org/north-buttress-iv-5-10b/809424\"&gt;&lt;b&gt;North Buttress&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td bgcolor=\"f6f6ff\" align=\"center\"&gt;Technical Rock Climb&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td bgcolor=\"f6ffff\" align=\"center\"&gt;IV 5.10b&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td bgcolor=\"f6fff6\" align=\"center\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://www.summitpost.org/mountains/photo_link.pl/p/photo_id__167159__object_id__1139__type__mountain__mountain_id__1139__route_id____user_id____order_by____limit__\"&gt;&lt;img width=\"60%\" src=\"http://www.summitpost.org/images/thumb/114562.JPG\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/noformat&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_3\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Getting There&lt;/h2&gt;From Highway US-395 in Bishop, drive approx. 10 miles north to the turn-off to Rovana. Drive west through Rovana and up Pine Creek Canyon to the Pine Creek trailhead. Hike up the trail to where the Italy Pass Trail goes north. Follow the Italy Pass Trail to a flat area of slabs and meadows just past Honeymoon Lake. Leave the trail and head west up to Royce Pass.  Cross over into the Royce Lakes Basin and hike south, passing east of Lake 11,725\', and head for the obvious saddle between Royce and Merriam.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;An easier but much longer approach can be made by continuing up the Pine Creek Pass Trail to Pine Creek Pass.  From the pass, contour west over a slight rise into Royce Lakes basin.  Merriam Peak is the large, impressive peak that first comes into view across the basin.&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;table class=\"inline_image_thumbs\"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=108250\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/108250.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=22232\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/22232.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=22233\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/22233.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=108251\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/108251.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_4\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Red Tape&lt;/h2&gt;For day hikes, no permit required.  For overnight stays, obtain a free wilderness permit at the White Mountain Ranger Station, 798 North Main Street, Bishop, CA  93514.  Phone number is 760-873-2500.  Permits may be reserved in advance for $5 per person.  Though walk-in permits are still free, the visitor quota for this trailhead is often filled.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For more info, visit the &lt;a href=\"http://www.summitpost.org/mountains/mountain_link.pl?mountain_id=4859\"&gt;Eastern Sierra Nevada Logistics Page&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_5\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;When To Climb&lt;/h2&gt;Best season is early June to mid October.

It\'s easy access, proximity to alpine lakes and short trail make it a popular hike year-round. The easiest route involves moderately steep hiking and a short 3rd class section. Since only a few mountains in the Wasatch are higher than Pfeifferhorn, the rewards are breathtaking views of the Salt Lake valley and surrounding mountains. Also, mountain goats can be frequently seen above upper Red Pine lake.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Pfeifferhorn is recorded as \"Little Matterhorn\" on USGS maps. The mountain is known as the Pfeifferhorn, in honor of Chuck Pfeiffer, a local climber who was the leader of the Wasatch Club.&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;table class=\"inline_image_thumbs\"&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=11160\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/11160.JPG\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=12651\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/12651.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=19693\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img style=\"\" src=\"/images/thumb/19693.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=12650\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/12650.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=116879\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/116879.JPG\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_2\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Getting There&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;br&gt;From the 6200 South exit of I-215, head East and South on 190 for about 2 miles to the intersection with Big Cottonwood Canyon, continue straight on 210 through the light (South) for about 4 miles to the mouth of Little Cottonwood, continue straight and East for about 5.5 miles to White Pine Trail head on the right. There is enough parking for about 50 cars. Toilet facilities are at the trailhead. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The easiest and most popular route is the &lt;a href=\"http://www.summitpost.org/show/route_link.pl/route_id/1593/object_id/1236\"&gt;East Ridge&lt;/a&gt; via Red Pine Lake trail up Little Cottonwood Canyon. The trail is approximately 3 miles to lower Red Pine lake and roughly 1/2 mile to the upper Red Pine Lake.  From here proceed southwest up the steep talus slope to the top of the \'false summit\'.  A well-defined trail should be visible here in the absence of snow.   Continue west along the ridge through a series of large boulders to a second steep slope.  You can either wrap around this slope to the south and switch-back up to the summit (easier) or just continue west \'til you reach the summit (steep).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Another way to climb Pfeifferhorn is to hike in through Maybird Gulch. A small foot bridge breaks off to the right from the Red Pine Lake trail and will take you into Maybird. You will pass 3 small lakes nestled under the Hogum Divide with the Pfeifferhorn rising straight ahead. Once past the uppermost lake you will find yourself in a large boulder field (granite talus) which is difficult and slow to cross. At the other side, a steep scramble will take you to the summit base. You can make a loop trip starting at Maybird Gulch, climbing to the peak, then down by way of upper/lower Red Pine lakes or vise-visa. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;table class=\"inline_image_thumbs\"&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=125032\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/125032.JPG\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=94693\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/94693.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=94695\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img style=\"\" src=\"/images/thumb/94695.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=114581\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/114581.JPG\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_3\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Red Tape&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;br&gt;No permits are required and there are no fees. The Pfeifferhorn sits in the &lt;a href=\"http://www.fs.fed.us/r4/wcnf/unit/slrd/wilderness/lone_peak_wilderness.shtml\"&gt;Lone Peak Wilderness area&lt;/a&gt;. Please practice &lt;a href=\"http://www.lnt.org\"&gt;\"Leave No Trace\"&lt;/a&gt; principles,&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;u&gt;The following acts are prohibited:&lt;/u&gt;&lt;br&gt;- Group sizes exceeding 10 persons.&lt;br&gt;- Camping within 200 feet of lakes, trails, or other sources of water.&lt;br&gt;- Camping for more than 3 days at one site.&lt;br&gt;- Short cutting a trail switchback.&lt;br&gt;- Disposing of garbage, debris, or other waste.&lt;br&gt;- Open fires in the Red Pine Fork and Maybird Gulch drainages.&lt;br&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_4\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;When To Climb&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;br&gt;Typically climbed in the spring, summer and fall months, but also in winter as a ski/mountaineering outing.  If you want to try doing this in the winter I strongly recommend taking a beacon, probe, and snow shovel for everyone in your party.&lt;br&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_5\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Camping&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;br&gt;Backcountry camping is allowed as long as you\'re at least 200 feet away from any running water or lake. The most common area is Red Pine Lakes. Maybird gulch would be a good place as well.&lt;br&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_6\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Mountain Conditions&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;br&gt;For current conditions please check &lt;a href=\"http://www.wrh.noaa.gov/slc/snow/mtn.php\"&gt;Northern Utah Mountain Weather Forecast&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"http://www.avalanche.org/%7Euac/advisory_w_glossary.htm\"&gt;Wasatch Avalanche Advisory&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_7\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;External Links&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://www.sltrib.com/sltrib/news/56405838-78/wasatch-geographic-names-peak.html.csp\"&gt;\"Pfeifferhorn\" is now the peak\'s official name&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://www.topozone.com/map.asp?lat=40.5271&amp;amp;lon=-111.7018&amp;amp;s=50&amp;amp;size=l&amp;amp;symshow=n&amp;amp;datum=nad83&amp;amp;layer=DRG25\"&gt;Topo&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Pfeifferhorn is referred to Little Matterhorn on the Topo&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://mtncommunity.org/dcforum/DCForumID1/1583.html\"&gt;mtncommunity.org&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;Trip Report of a winter ascent of the North Ridge&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://fritzrips.com/v-web/bulletin/bb/viewtopic.php?t=105&amp;amp;sid=ca1b65ecc84033edbdd3be61d6e12daa\"&gt;NW Couloir of the Pfeiff 3-9-05&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_8\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Images&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div align=\"center\"&gt;&lt;table id=\"my_images\"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/the-pfeifferhorn/507626/c-151177\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"The Pfeifferhorn\" src=\"/images/square/507626.JPG\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/alpine-ridge-viewed-from-twin-lakes-pass/453964/c-151177\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Alpine Ridge viewed from Twin Lakes Pass.\" src=\"/images/square/453964.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/march-12-2005-the/94826/c-151177\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"March 12, 2005 - The...\" src=\"/images/square/94826.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/pfeifferhorn/461607/c-151177\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Pfeifferhorn\" src=\"/images/square/461607.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/pheifferhorn/580854/c-151177\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Pheifferhorn\" src=\"/images/square/580854.JPG\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/pfeifferhorn/844094/c-151177\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Pfeifferhorn\" src=\"/images/square/844094.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/pfeifferhorn-over-maybird-lakes/470692/c-151177\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Pfeifferhorn over Maybird lakes\" src=\"/images/square/470692.JPG\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/looking-back-at-red-pine-lake/141407/c-151177\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Looking back at Red Pine Lake...\" src=\"/images/square/141407.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/alpine-ridge-pfeiffhorn-to-south-thunder-mtn/235176/c-151177\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Alpine Ridge (Pfeiffhorn to South Thunder Mtn)\" src=\"/images/square/235176.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/north-ridge/250281/c-151177\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"North Ridge\" src=\"/images/square/250281.JPG\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/pfeifferhorn/234976/c-151177\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Pfeifferhorn\" src=\"/images/square/234976.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/reflection-of-the-destination/419134/c-151177\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Reflection of the Destination\" src=\"/images/square/419134.JPG\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/silver-creek-from-sub-pfeiff/204581/c-151177\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Silver Creek from Sub-Pfeiff\" src=\"/images/square/204581.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/red-pine-lakes/510961/c-151177\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Red Pine Lakes\" src=\"/images/square/510961.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td colspan=\"7\" align=\"center\"&gt;[ &lt;a href=\"/pfeifferhorn/images/p-151177\"&gt;View Gallery - 320 More Images&lt;/a&gt; ]&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/article&gt;date:difficulty:'),(61,151202,'/cloudripper/151202','/palisades/171074','Cloudripper','','','','13525','',33925,37.1425,-118.531,'California, United States, North America','','',171074,'Palisades','','','','','','Mountain-Rock','content: &lt;article&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_1\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2 id=\"first_h2\"&gt;Overview&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;i&gt;I inherited this page from pilz8 in November 2011 and wanted to thank him for creating the page and giving me the chance to build on it.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Cloudripper is the highest peak of the Inconsolable Range, a small subrange north of the Palisades and just outside Kings Canyon National Park in the Sierra Nevada.  Rising to just over 13,500 feet, Cloudripper also ranks as the 58th highest in California and is included on the Sierra Club&rsquo;s Sierra Peaks Section &lt;a href=\"http://www.summitpost.org/sierra-peaks-section-sps/404706\"&gt;SPS List&lt;/a&gt;.  One of the most accessible 13ers in California, there are several class 2 or 3 approach and route options, and trips to Cloudripper can be completed as moderate dayhikes involving as little as seven miles round trip and less than 4000 feet elevation gain.  Overnight outings are popular as well, with multiple alpine lakes and meadows surrounding the peak in every direction.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The views from Cloudripper are stunning, especially of the Palisade region.  The vista includes notable points such as Mount Sill, North Palisade, Mount Agassiz, the Palisade Glacier, Mount Goode, Mount Goddard, Mount Darwin, Mount Humphreys, White Mountain, and many more.  Trips to Cloudripper can easily be combined with a stop at &lt;a href=\"http://www.summitpost.org/chocolate-peak/153021\"&gt;Chocolate Peak&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"http://www.summitpost.org/vagabond-peak/153022\"&gt;Vagabond Peak&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href=\"http://www.summitpost.org/sky-haven/726219\"&gt;Sky Haven&lt;/a&gt;, and if on an overnight trip there are countless other possibilities.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;noformat&gt; &lt;table class=\"inline_image_thumbs\"&gt; &lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=11360\" rel=\"nofollow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/11360.JPG\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=700966\" rel=\"nofollow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/700966.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=11359\" rel=\"nofollow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/11359.JPG\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=719906\" rel=\"nofollow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/719906.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=434318\" rel=\"nofollow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/434318.JPG\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=638747\" rel=\"nofollow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/638747.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/noformat&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_2\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Getting There&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;div align=\"center\" class=\"image-right\" style=\"width: 206px;\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"/high-res-topo/412975\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"high res topo\" height=\"146\" width=\"200\" src=\"/images/small/412975.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=\"caption\"&gt;Route Map&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div align=\"center\" class=\"image-left\" style=\"width: 156px;\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"/w-chute/412947\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"w chute\" height=\"200\" width=\"150\" src=\"/images/small/412947.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=\"caption\"&gt;West Chute&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br&gt;The two most commonly used trailheads for trips to Cloudripper are from either South Lake or Glacier Lodge (North Fork Big Pine Creek).

There are scenic alpine lakes encountered on every route, all making excellent overnight destinations.  Some of the great options include Bull Lake, Green Lake, Thunder and Lightning Lake, any of the Big Pine Lakes, and several others.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If completing a daytrip, dispersed camping is allowed in Inyo National Forest, including a handful of areas along or just off Highway 168 from Bishop to South Lake. Even better, there are literally hundreds of roadside camping options in Buttermilk Country, located off Buttermilk Road (north of Highway 168). There are outstanding views of Mount Humphreys, Basin Mountain, Mount Tom, and White Mountain Peak from throughout the area.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Established campgrounds are abundant along the road to South Lake and in the immediate vicinity of both the South Lake and Glacier Lodge trailheads.  There are also additional options nearby further up Highway 168 en route to Lake Sabrina.

The climb is rated III, 5.6, AI2 or WI3. For the High Sierra ice climber, this is a \" must do \" classic climb of the range!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There seems to be some confusion regarding the name of this route. The Climbers Guide to the High Sierra ( Steve Roper,  1976 ) called it the Northeast Couloir. The Sierra Classics ( Moynier / Fiddler 1993 ) calls it the Northwest Couloir. The latest edition of The High Sierra, Peaks, Passes and Trails by R. J. Secor calls it the North Couloir ( maybe he wanted to split the difference )! Rest assured, there is only one ice gully on Mount Gilbert. I call great fun! &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Other routes include - &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Southeast Slope - class 1.&lt;br&gt;The East Ridge - class 2 via a loose chute from above the Treasure Lakes.&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;table class=\"inline_image_thumbs\"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=20256\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/20256.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=13082\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/13082.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=11766\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/11766.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=12205\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/12205.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=13081\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/13081.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_2\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Getting There&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;br&gt;Take Hwy 168 from Bishop to the trail head at South Lake.

While easily climbed from the cross country trail over Lamarck Col ( class 2 ), Mount Lamarck also has a moderate ice gully on the North Face which provides excellent snow and ice climbing. The South Slope and Southeast Slope are also class 2.&lt;br&gt;Mount Lamarck has an excellent view of Mounts Darwin and Mendel!&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;table class=\"inline_image_thumbs\"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=19176\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/19176.JPG\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=11985\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/11985.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=12458\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/12458.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=12456\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/12456.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=81921\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/81921.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_2\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Getting There&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;br&gt;Take Highway 168 from Bishop, CA. Follow the road to the North Lake trail head. Take the Lamarck Lake trail to Lower lamarck Lake. To climb the ice gully on the North Face, continue to Upper Lamack Lake. From here, rock hopping up the moraine past a glacial tarn leads to the pocket glacier at the base of the North Face.&lt;br&gt;For the class 2 route from Lamarck Col, leave the Lamarck Lakes trail between the Lower and Upper Lakes and head southwest along a faint path ( see R. J. Secors The High Sierra, Peaks, Passes and Trails guide book ). &lt;br&gt;The maps for this area are the Mt. Darwin and Mt. Thompson 7.5 minute USGS quadrangles.&lt;br&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_3\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Red Tape&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;br&gt;Wilderness permits are required for overnight camping. There is a wilderness permit quota in effect from May 1st to November 1st. 60% of the wilderness permit quota is advance reservation ( $5.00 per person ) and 40% is available on a walk in first come first serve basis ( free ).

I don\'t think it really makes sense for them to be separate given the proximity of these two summits. Perhaps it might be sufficient to include one section labeled &ldquo;Northwest Lamarck&rdquo; on this page?

The Piute  Pass trail ( permit required for overnight camping ) is the approach for the West Ridge ( class 3 ), South Slope ( class 3 ), Southeast face ( II, 5.4 ) and the Southeast Ridge ( class 3 ).&lt;br&gt;For the North Face ice gully, turn right on Dutch Johns Meadow road ( behind the abandoned wilderness permit kiosk, about 10 miles from Bishop ) and follow the rough, worn dirt road about 6.2 mile to a fork ( turn left ) followed by another left . 4 x 4 vehicles recommended. Right before the end of the road, park at a large standpipe next to a scenic drop off. Contour from here via cross country hiking to the south and into the Birch Creek drainage, south of Peak 13,121\' ( Checkered Demon ).

From the base the summit is not particularly prominent, although the abruptness with which this peak, and the Wasatch Range in general, rise from the valley below impresses both visitors and residents alike.  The transformation from modern city to rugged backcountry terrain is similarly abrupt; the normal trailhead is on a busy street, yet after a half mile the trail crosses into the Mount Olympus Wilderness.  Mount Olympus is a prominent part of the Salt Lake City skyline and it\'s north face will impress even the most zealous mountaineer.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The mountain is climbed often, usually via the class 3 (YDS) &lt;a href=\"http://www.summitpost.com/mountains/route_link.pl/route_id/1055/object_id/1396\"&gt;Mount Olympus Trail&lt;/a&gt;, which climbs 4200 feet over 3.5 miles from the well-marked trailhead at 5800 S. and Wasatch Blvd.  Olympus offers many mountaineering routes.  One could spend an entire summer exploring the mountain.&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;table class=\"inline_image_thumbs\"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=38031\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/38031.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=37708\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/37708.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=18152\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/18152.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=82933\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/82933.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=143677\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/143677.JPG\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_2\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Getting to the Base&lt;/h2&gt;The address of the trailhead is approximately &lt;a href=\"http://maps.yahoo.com/py/maps.py?BFCat=&amp;amp;Pyt=Tmap&amp;amp;newFL=Use+Address+Below&amp;amp;addr=5800+S.+wasatch+blvd.&amp;amp;csz=Holladay%2C+UT&amp;amp;Country=us&amp;amp;Get%A0Map=Get+Map\"&gt;Wasatch Blvd. and Tolcate Hills Rd.&lt;/a&gt;  The trailhead is roughly 1/4 mile north of Tolcate Hills Road along Wasatch Blvd at 5800 south on the east side of Wasatch Blvd., and is marked with a brown sign reading \"Mount Olympus Trailhead\".  Park either along Wasatch Blvd. or in a slightly hidden parking lot just north of the trailhead.  Local authorities prefer for you to park in the parking lot rather than along Wasatch Blvd.  Juveniles often make victims of those who park in the \"hidden\" lot.  I recommend you park along Wasatch Blvd.  It adds 20 feet of elevation gain and 30 yards of hiking to your start.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;table class=\"inline_image_thumbs\"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=12681\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/12681.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=35294\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/35294.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=132434\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/132434.JPG\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=137324\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/137324.JPG\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_3\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Red Tape/Camping&lt;/h2&gt;Mount Olympus is inside the &lt;a href=\"http://www.fs.fed.us/wcnf/slrd/mtolymps.html\"&gt;Mount Olympus Wilderness&lt;/a&gt;.  The Mount Olympus Wilderness consists of approximately 16,000 acres and is generally bounded on the north by Mill Creek Canyon, on the south by Big Cottonwood Canyon, on the west by the Salt Lake Valley, and on the east by Gobbler\'s Knob, Alexander Basin, and Dog Lake.\"&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;font size=\"+1\" color=\"red\"&gt;NO!&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; Motor vehicles, mechanized equipment, hang gliders, bicycles, relieving yourself in the SLC water supply, group sizes exceeding 10 persons, camping within 200 feet of lakes, streams, springs, or other water sources, camping within 200 feet of trails, camping for more than 3 days at one site, short cutting a trail switchback, and disposing of garbage, debris, or other waste.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\"For further information contact the Salt Lake Ranger District at (801) 733-2660 or our Outdoor Recreation Information Center at (801) 466-6411\"&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;table class=\"inline_image_thumbs\"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=12682\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/12682.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_4\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;DO NOT SHORT CUT SWITCHBACKS&lt;/h2&gt;Trail erosion has become a huge problem on the main trail up Mount Olympus.  This trail sees heavy use, especially to Tolcat Creek 1.5 miles up the trail from Wasatch Blvd.  Those who use the first portion of the trail are often just out for a short hike to walk their dog, check out the views of the valley, or look at flora and fauna.  Trail erosion, trail braiding, and litter are increasingly becoming troublesome on this first section to Tolcat Creek.&lt;br&gt;If you choose to use this approach DO NOT cut switchbacks.  Stay on the trail.

This rugged 11,000+ foot summit is clearly visible from North Salt Lake to Provo.  It rises abruptly above the valley floor and affords one the luxury of sitting in a glacial, alpine cirque just miles from the city.  The cirque is ringed with near vertical granite walls and offers climbing ranging from Class 3 to 5.10 YDS.  Lone Peak is considered by many to be the \"hardest\" 11,000 foot peak in the Wasatch due to the mileage and elevation gain required to sit atop it\'s summit.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;table class=\"inline_image_thumbs\"&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=135307\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/135307.JPG\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=12652\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/12652.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=12655\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/12655.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=12653\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/12653.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=13356\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_2\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Getting There&lt;/h2&gt;Lone Peak can be and has been approached a variety of ways.

When the green gate is locked, you can park here and hike due East until you connect with the Bonneville Shoreline Trail.  The Cherry Canyon Logging Trail intersects with the BST and the trail junction is signed.  The Cherry Canyon trail eventually turns North into upper Bear Canyon.  You can stay on it, traverse Bear (where there is reliable water) cross a shoulder into Little Willow.  The trail ends at the Allen Brothers Cabin but the route continues right up the drainage and will eventually take you to the North Cirque and the North shoulder of Lone Peak.  If you prefer, just as the Cherry Canyon Trail turns North into Bear Canyon, head off across the open slope to the Southeast and you will soon connect with the old Draper Ridge trail.  &lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td valign=\"bottom\" style=\"padding-top: 6px;\" colspan=\"2\"&gt;&lt;span style=\"font-size: 9px; color: #888;\"&gt;Posted May 15, 2004 10:36 pm&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;table border=\"0\" width=\"775\" class=\"messages\"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td width=\"110\" align=\"left\" valign=\"top\" style=\"padding-top: 6px;\"&gt;&lt;a name=\"120453\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a class=\"dis_user_lnk\" href=\"/users/rmjwinters/2002\"&gt;rmjwinters&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td valign=\"top\" style=\"padding-top: 6px;\"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Untitled Comment&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td align=\"right\" valign=\"top\" nowrap style=\"font-size: 10px;\"&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td valign=\"top\" rowspan=\"2\" align=\"left\" style=\"padding-top: 6px;\"&gt;&lt;p class=\"disc_avatar\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"/users/rmjwinters/2002\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"rmjwinters\" width=\"50\" height=\"50\" border=\"0\" src=\"/images/avatars/535593.JPG\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=\"font-size: 9px; color: #888;\"&gt;Hasn\'t voted&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td colspan=\"2\" style=\"padding-top: 6px;\"&gt;Thanks for the info.

The trailhead is located 4.5 miles up Big Cottonwood Canyon from the intersection of Wasatch Blvd at the mouth of the canyon. There is a parking lot on the righthand side of the road. This parking lot also serves as the trailhead for Lake Blanche and the approach to Sundial Peak.  The trail is located at the west end of the parking lot and has a sign indicating Broad\'s Fork.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;table class=\"inline_image_thumbs\"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=110892\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/110892.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=24021\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/24021.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_3\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Broads Fork Approach&lt;/h2&gt;The trailhead is 4.5 miles up Big Cottonwood Canyon at 6200 ft.  There is a well-defined trail that climbs steeply for the first two miles to the meadows at 8400 ft.  Generally, the trail crosses the creek to the east and follows the east side of the valley.  However, in early spring snow conditions may be such that consolidated snow may allow for easier ascent up the western side of the valley.  The north face of Sunrise is in clear view the entire approach from the meadows.  Continue climbing another 2 miles until directly under the north face of Sunrise.  This is also where the route to Twin Peaks heads up and to the west.  One may either ascent to the saddle between Twin Peaks and Sunrise and ascend the peak via the western ridge (this is a little longer route) or ascent the chute just to the east of Sunrise.  This chute leads to the saddle between Sunrise and Dromedary.  Climb the chute via snow or loose scree to the saddle.  From the saddle climb class 3-4 ledges and blocks to the rounded summit at 11,275 feet.  The north face of Sunrise offers some exposure.  The easier climbing stays to the south side of the ridge.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;table class=\"inline_image_thumbs\"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=112994\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/112994.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_4\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Red Tape&lt;/h2&gt;No permits or fees are required and camping is allowed within the Twin Peaks Wilderness area.  Summer weekends may present some parking challenges.&lt;br&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_5\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;When To Climb&lt;/h2&gt;The general climbing season is June-September, however, the mountain can be climbed all year.  Winter ascents present avalanche danger and only experienced mountaineers should attempt the peak in winter.  Late spring ascents are recommended once the snow has consolidated and the final snow has broken off the slabs east of Twin Peaks.  Crampons and ice axe are recommended for winter or late spring ascents.&lt;br&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_6\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Camping&lt;/h2&gt;Camping is allowed within the Twin Peaks Wilderness area.  Camping at the meadows within 2 miles of the trailhead is usually preferred.&lt;br&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_7\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The Triple Traverse&lt;/h2&gt;Twin Peaks, Sunrise and Dromedary can be climbed in one day from the Broads Fork trailhead.  It is a long day at 11 miles and 6000 ft elevation gain.  All 3 peaks can be climbed either west to east or east to west.  Generally, the traverse is done beginning with Twin Peaks on the west and ending on Dromedary.&lt;br&gt;From upper Broad\'s Fork follow the standard route for Twin Peaks to the Twin Peaks/Sunrise saddle.  Continue up the southwestern ridge to Twin Peaks.  Return to the saddle and ascend the west ridge of Sunrise to it\'s summit.  Descend Sunrise\'s east ridge to reach the Sunrise/Dromedary saddle.  This point provides a good option to end the traverse if inclimate weather or fatigue becomes an issue.  If conditions and stamina are good, drop slightly down to the southeast from the Dromedary/Sunrise saddle.  Contour to a small couloir and ascend the couloir to Dromedary\'s summit.  Either return to the Dromedary/Sunrise saddle or descend the east slopes of Dromedary and contour underneath the north face of Dromedary on talus or snow.&lt;br&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_8\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;External Links&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://www.wunderground.com/US/UT/Provo.html\"&gt;Salt Lake City Weather&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://www.topozone.com/map.asp?lat=40.5854&amp;amp;lon=-111.7152&amp;amp;s=50&amp;amp;size=l&amp;amp;symshow=n&amp;amp;u=0&amp;amp;layer=DRG25\"&gt;Topo Map&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt; Sunrise is named O\'Sullivan on the Topo&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;                                                                                    &lt;div align=\"center\"&gt;&lt;a name=\"messages\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_9\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Additions and Corrections&lt;/h2&gt;[ &lt;a href=\"/object_discussion.php?type=vote_comments&amp;amp;object_id=151268&amp;amp;is_addition=1#vote_form\"&gt;Post an Addition or Correction&lt;/a&gt; ]&lt;table cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" style=\"width: 775px;\"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;table cellpadding=\"2\" cellspacing=\"2\" width=\"100%\"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;&lt;span class=\"pagertext\"&gt;Viewing: &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;-&lt;b&gt;5&lt;/b&gt; of &lt;b&gt;5&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td align=\"center\"&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td align=\"right\"&gt;    &lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;table border=\"0\" width=\"775\" class=\"messages\"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td width=\"110\" align=\"left\" valign=\"top\" style=\"padding-top: 6px;\"&gt;&lt;a name=\"120878\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a class=\"dis_user_lnk\" href=\"/users/scott/16365\"&gt;Scott&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td valign=\"top\" style=\"padding-top: 6px;\"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Untitled Comment&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td align=\"right\" valign=\"top\" nowrap style=\"font-size: 10px;\"&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td valign=\"top\" rowspan=\"2\" align=\"left\" style=\"padding-top: 6px;\"&gt;&lt;p class=\"disc_avatar\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"/users/scott/16365\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Scott\" width=\"50\" height=\"50\" border=\"0\" src=\"/images/avatars/142800.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=\"font-size: 9px; color: #888;\"&gt;Voted 10/10&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td colspan=\"2\" style=\"padding-top: 6px;\"&gt;lat:  40.5991&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r&lt;br&gt;lon:  -111.7113&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td valign=\"bottom\" style=\"padding-top: 6px;\" colspan=\"2\"&gt;&lt;span style=\"font-size: 9px; color: #888;\"&gt;Posted Feb 8, 2005 5:48 pm&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;table border=\"0\" width=\"775\" class=\"messages\"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td width=\"110\" align=\"left\" valign=\"top\" style=\"padding-top: 6px;\"&gt;&lt;a name=\"193851\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a class=\"dis_user_lnk\" href=\"/users/dmitry-pruss/22982\"&gt;Dmitry Pruss&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td valign=\"top\" style=\"padding-top: 6px;\"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Coords are still not there&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td align=\"right\" valign=\"top\" nowrap style=\"font-size: 10px;\"&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td valign=\"top\" rowspan=\"2\" align=\"left\" style=\"padding-top: 6px;\"&gt;&lt;p class=\"disc_avatar\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"/users/dmitry-pruss/22982\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Dmitry Pruss\" width=\"50\" height=\"50\" border=\"0\" src=\"/images/avatars/719338.JPG\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=\"font-size: 9px; color: #888;\"&gt;Voted 10/10&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td colspan=\"2\" style=\"padding-top: 6px;\"&gt;could you please add them to place this mountain on the interactive maps etc. at last!

Follow the paved road 8.5 miles passing both &lt;a href=\"http://www.snowbird.com/\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;Snowbird&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"http://www.altaskiarea.com/\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;Alta ski resorts&lt;/a&gt; along the way.  After 8.5 miles, the pavement ends with a dirt road continuing 2.5 more miles to Albion Basin trailhead.&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;table class=\"inline_image_thumbs\"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=108596\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/108596.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=115366\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/115366.JPG\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=120086\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/120086.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_3\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Red Tape&lt;/h2&gt;The road into Albion Basin is generally open from mid-June through the first substantial snowfall each Fall.  The road is restricted.  On weekends a limited number of vehicles are allowed up the road.  The speed limit is 15 MPH to limit environmental impact.  Parking is limited to designated areas only and is enforced.  There are no fees for entering or parking.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_4\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Albion Basin-Cecret Lake Approach&lt;/h2&gt;The approach follows the Cecret Lake trail which leaves from the Albion Basin campground at 9400 ft.  Hike the 3/4 mile trail to Cecret Lake.  Continue around the east side of the lake.  A faint trail with switchbacks climbs 800 ft to the saddle between Devil\'s Castle and Sugarloaf Peak (west.)  Turn left (east) at the saddle and follow the trail which quickly becomes knife-edge.  The route is faint in places, but generally stays to the south side of the ridge within 20 ft of the ridge.  After several hundred yards, climb a small (80 ft) chute back to the ridge and the knife edge.  The low Class 5 climbing begins here and continues to the first summit where most people stop.  Continue along the ridge to the other 2 summits.  Good routefinding skills are required to keep this low Class 5 climbing.  Upon reaching the 3rd summit one may continue east along the ridge and decend back into Albion Basin to return the same way.  This scramble is only for those who are confident and their abilities and caution should be taken with some loose rock on the scramble.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;table class=\"inline_image_thumbs\"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=12660\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/12660.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=107145\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/107145.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=107146\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/107146.JPG\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=127002\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/127002.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_5\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;When To Climb&lt;/h2&gt;Snow remains in the basin year-round.

It is protected by surrounding 11,000 foot peaks and is probably the most photographed peak along the Wasatch range.   It\'s prominent north face is a challenging rock climb.  Additionally, Sundial Peak has been chosen to be the symbol for the &lt;a href=\"http://www.xmission.com/~wmc/\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;Wasatch Mountain Club&lt;/a&gt;.  The summit is seldom visited as many people choose to stop at Lake Blanche, which sits just to the north of the peak.  For those choosing to summit, it can be ascended via a Class 3 route on the southwestern side of the peak.  In the spring and winter it offers an exhilarating snow/ice climb on it\'s northwest side.&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;table class=\"inline_image_thumbs\"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=12679\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/12679.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=19177\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/19177.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=88428\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/88428.JPG\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=115670\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/115670.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=123960\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/123960.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_2\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Getting There&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;br&gt;The trailhead is located in Big Cottonwood Canyon.  To reach Big Cottonwood Canyon take the 6200 S exit off Interstate 215 and follow the signs east for the Brighton/Solitude ski resorts.  The trailhead is located 4.5 miles up Big Cottonwood Canyon from the intersection of Wasatch Blvd at the mouth of the canyon.  There is a parking lot on the righthand side of the road.  This parking lot also serves as the trailhead for the Broad\'s Fork approach to Twin Peaks, Sunrise, &amp;amp; Dromedary peaks.  The trail is located just past the restrooms on the east side of the lot and follows a paved trail for 1/4 of a mile.&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;table class=\"inline_image_thumbs\"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=111272\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/111272.JPG\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_3\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Red Tape&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;br&gt;There are no permits or fees required although parking can be limited on summer weekend days.  Sundial Peak is located in the Twin Peaks wilderness area.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_4\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;When To Climb&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;br&gt;Generally, Sundial Peak is climbed from June through September.  Winter ascents are common to the base of the peak, however, travel to the summit requires winter mountaineering skills.  Ice axe and crampons are recommended past Lake Blanche when snow conditions exist.&lt;br&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_5\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Lake Blanche Approach&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;br&gt;The main approach to Sundial is via the Lake Blanche Trail located 4.5 miles up Big Cottonwood Canyon.  The trailhead is located at 6200 ft.  The trail leaves from the east end of the parking lot and is paved for the first 1/4 mile.  It then turns south at the creek and climbs along the creek for 200 yards to a footbridge.  Cross the bridge and ascend into Twin Peaks wilderness area.  &lt;br&gt;The trail climbs steadily for 2 miles and then steepens for the last 1 mile to Lake Blanche.  The trail is well maintained to the lake.  Upon reaching the lake proceed around the north end and cross the outlet of the lake on the west end.  Continue in a southern direction toward the talus at the base of Sundial\'s north face.  This area before the talus can be swampy in early spring.  It is easier to stay a little west of the talus should you encounter these conditions.&lt;br&gt;When you are at the base of the talus, aim right (west) and climb up into a hanging valley to the west of the peak.  Caution should be used in early spring to avoid snowbridges within the cliff bands.  Continue in a southeasterly direction up into the hanging valley.  The summit of Sundial will be visible on the ridgeline to your left (east).  Continue  in the hanging valley for about 3/4 miles and look for a small saddle on the ridge to the east.

It is visible for miles in all directions.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;table class=\"inline_image_thumbs\"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=92378\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/92378.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=13253\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/13253.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=133648\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/133648.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=13355\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/13355.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=13252\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/13252.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_2\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Getting There&lt;/h2&gt;Mt. Nebo can be approached several ways:  The North route, The South Route(Andrew\'s Ridge) or via the town of Mona and Willow Creek.  The two most popular approaches, north and south, begin on the east side of the mountain.  The approach from Mona is on the west side and is less popular.  The two main approaches both launch from the Nebo Loop road on the east side of the Nebo complex.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The North Approach:   &lt;br&gt;Take Interstate 15 south from Salt Lake City for about 40 miles to the town of Payson.  Take the Payson exit and measure from here.  The trailhead is exactly 25 miles from the Interstate 15 exit.  Go through the town of Payson for 0.7 miles and turn left at a light (100 N).  Signs point the way to the Nebo Scenic Byway.  Turn right after 0.2 miles onto the Nebo Scenic Byway and continue 24 miles to the Nebo Bench Trail.  You may park here or continue on the dirt road at the entrance to the Nebo Bench trail parking area for 0.3 miles on Mona Pole Rd.  Cross the cattle guard and park here.  The road continues, but the trail follows the fence up the hill to the west.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The South Approach:  &lt;br&gt;Follow Interstate 15 south from Salt Lake for approximately 80 miles to the town of Nephi.  From Interstate 15 take exit 225 at Nephi and drive east on Utah Highway 132 for approximately 4.5 miles.  Take a left (north) on the Nebo Loop Road.  Drive 3.3 miles and take another left.  Drive 1.3 miles to the trailhead, which is in a parking area on the left.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Note:  Interstate 15 passes on the west side of Mt. Nebo.  The Nebo Scenic Byway passes on the east side of Mt. Nebo and connects Payson on the north with Nephi to the south.&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;table class=\"inline_image_thumbs\"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=100863\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/100863.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=13254\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/13254.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=135088\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/135088.JPG\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=100885\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/100885.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=100854\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/100854.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_3\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Red Tape&lt;/h2&gt;No fees or permits are required.

Pyramid Peak is not climbed all that often due to its proximity to several other fine peaks in the area with shorter approaches and higher summits.  Still, as crowded as the Little Lakes Valley is, this truly pyramid-shaped, striped peak receives little attention, and it is a fine scramble.&lt;br&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_2\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Getting There&lt;/h2&gt;The best (easiest) way to access this peak is via the Mosquito Flat trailhead.  This trailhead is at 10,300\' or so, making for an easy approach to the peak.  The trailhead is reached by driving up the Rock Creek Road, which leaves Highway 395 at Tom\'s Place.  Mosquito Flat is approximately 11 steep miles up the Rock Creek Road.  Parking is limited at the trailhead, so during the busy summer months, get there early, or you\'ll get a little extra distance on your trip walking up from the overflow parking area.    This trail is the remnant of one of the original roads to the tungsten mine in Pine Creek Canyon, abandoned after a better (shorter) road was built in the canyon.  The other option to access this peak is the Pine Creek Road, which leaves Highway 395 near the turnoff to the famous Owens River Gorge.  This turnoff is about 10 miles north of Bishop.  Follow the road to the tungsten mine, and park outside the gate.  This trail is an abandoned road, and the trailhead is much lower, around 7,500 feet.&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;table class=\"inline_image_thumbs\"&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=45910\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/16115.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_3\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Red Tape&lt;/h2&gt;The Little Lakes Valley trail is a quota trail, and this area is very popular.  A wilderness permit is required for overnight travel in this area, and wood fires are not only passe, but prohibited.  There is no fee for the limited trailhead parking at either trailhead.  Be advised that the Rock Creek Road is not cleared in the winter, so once the snow flies, the road is closed.&lt;br&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_4\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;When To Climb&lt;/h2&gt;The best time to climb this peak sans snow or ice is April (dry winter) or May through September (early winter) or October (normal), and even sometimes November or December.  Depends upon Mother Nature.&lt;br&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_5\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Camping&lt;/h2&gt;There are over 300 campsites available in Rock Creek Canyon, in 13 different campgrounds and facilities.

Timp, as the locals call it, is the 2nd highest mountain in the Wasatch range &lt;a href=\"http://www.summitpost.com/mountains/mountain_link.pl/mountain_id/1443\"&gt;(only Mt. Nebo is higher)&lt;/a&gt;. What sets \"Timp\" apart is its location.  It towers over the Provo, Orem, Pleasant Grove area and its a very dominant feature.  It rises 7000 feet from the valley floor and draws your gaze to it again and again.This mountain may be the most popular one in the state of Utah and is certainly the most climbed.   Mt. Timpanogos is a huge mountain, extending almost seven  miles in a north to south direction with many of its peaks reaching over the 11000 foot mark.  You can  normally hike to the top of the highest summit but when the snow flies or a storm is present, it becomes very quickly a mountain you need to take very seriously.   One interesting fact about Mt. Timp is that is has &lt;a href=\"http://www.summitpost.org/article/186144/100-years-on-the-timpanogos-glacier.html\"&gt;the only real glacier in Utah,&lt;/a&gt; although it is very small.  The glacier is one of the highlights for many of those who summit the mountain, using it as a quick descent route. &lt;br&gt;The vast circues and basins were carved and gouged into this mountain by much more extensive glaciation as recently as 12000+ years ago.  There are 2 main trails that lead to the summit, joining at a gap not far from the main summit. &lt;br&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_3\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;GETTING THERE&lt;/h2&gt;You can access Mt. Timpanogos easily from Highway I-15, using the 272 exit and driving east along highway 52 ( 800 North in Orem) to the junction with highway 189, the Provo Canyon road.  Go East on 189 for 7 miles to the Sundance Ski resort turnoff (watch for it just after you go through a tunnel) and turn left on highway 92 for 6 miles, going past the  &lt;a href=\"http://www.utah.com/ski/resorts/sundance.htm\"&gt;Sundance ski area&lt;/a&gt;  and the Aspen Grove recreation area.  Proceed until you come to a fee booth (pay the fee ) and look for parking just beyond in a lot at the left.  If full, look for additional parking just up the road.   From the parking lot, you\'ll find the most popular trail, the Aspen Grove trail that heads on up the mountain&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The other way to access Mt. Timp from I-15 is to take the 284 exit and go east on highway 92.  Go 8 miles until you enter the American Fork Canyon and you\'ll be confronted by a fee booth. Continue on another 8.2 miles (passing the Timpanogos Cave national monument area) until you come to the Timpooneke Campground on the right side of the road.  The trailhead to the Timpooneke route is just beyond the campground area.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;BTW, the nearest major airport is Salt Lake City international, located about 45 miles north. &lt;br&gt;&lt;div class=\"image-left\" style=\"width: 494px;\" align=\"center\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"/january-22-2005-joe/87205\"&gt;&lt;img style=\"\" alt=\"January 22, 2005 - Joe...\" src=\"/images/original/87205.jpg\" height=\"650\" width=\"488\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=\"caption\"&gt;Everest Ridge - Photo by Pellucid Wombat&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_4\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;WHEN TO CLIMB AND MOUNTAIN CONDITIONS&lt;/h2&gt;The best time of year to climb Mt. Timp is late spring through late fall. Of course, if you take the time to look at the photos, you\'ll see that there are those who love to climb it during the winter.  Winter climbing requires a different level of experience and risk taking but the challenge is there and Timp is climbed in all seasons.   &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;While a trail takes one to the top of Mt. Timp during the summer and early fall,  there are still times of the year when climbing Mt. Timp poses a good challenge.  One route that poses more of a challenge is to use ice axe and crampons to go up the glacier route, although this is generally best in the early and late spring.  Snow obliterates the trail for a good part of the year and there are places where ice axe and crampons would be needed.  This is a big mountain and fatalities have occurred on it when people underestimated it when snow still persisted.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div class=\"image-left\" style=\"width: 506px;\" align=\"center\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"/about-the-10k-level/947176\"&gt;&lt;img style=\"\" alt=\"About the 10K level\" src=\"/images/medium/947176.JPG\" height=\"375\" width=\"500\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=\"caption\"&gt;Hitting the 10,000 foot level &lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Other possibilities abound on this huge mountain and its area.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Advice on mountain conditions may be obtained by calling the Pleasant Grove Ranger station at 801-785 3563 or the Uinta National forest office at 801 377-5780. Also, current hiking trail conditions are provided by &lt;b&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://www.tert.org\"&gt;TERT&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/b&gt;, the Timpanogos Emergency Response Team, and should be fairly accurate.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div class=\"image-left\" style=\"width: 381px;\" align=\"center\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"/dean-crossing-the-snow-patch/529911\"&gt;&lt;img style=\"\" alt=\"Dean crossing the snow patch\" src=\"/images/medium/529911.JPG\" height=\"500\" width=\"375\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=\"caption\"&gt;Nice to have micro spikes even in June&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_5\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;PARKING, RED TAPE, and weather&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;div class=\"image-left\" style=\"width: 506px;\" align=\"center\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"/february-5th-2005-joe/88785\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"February 5th, 2005 - Joe...\" src=\"/images/medium/88785.jpg\" height=\"375\" width=\"500\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=\"caption\"&gt;Photo by PellucidWombat&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br&gt;The biggest problem that summertime hikers (of the two major trails) are likely to run into is parking, at least if you are hiking on a Saturday, Sunday, or holiday.  Even though the Forest Service recently expanded the Aspen Grove parking area, both it and the Timpooneke trailhead parking lots fill up very fast on weekends and holidays - often before sunrise.  Once they are full, there are not a lot of options, and illegal parking is becoming a huge problem.  Please do not park illegally, recently they have been towing illegally parked cars, and it is probably an expensive bill!  If you find yourself in a pinch, here are a few suggestions.  First of all just know that the Aspen Grove lot is larger, so if it is full then the Timpooneke lot is definately full also. If the Timpooneke lot is full - drive further up the campground road - about 1/2 mile or so, and follow the sign for the &lt;b&gt;Timpooneke Road&lt;/b&gt;, which branches off to the right.  You may park along this dirt road, but be careful to leave enough room on the dirt road for others to pass, then just walk back to the trailhead.  &lt;b&gt;Do not park in the campground&lt;/b&gt;, you will be ticketed or towed.  Many people at the Timpooneke trailhead have been parking back on the Alpine Loop, many of them illegally, so this is not recommended.  For the Aspen Grove trailhead - there are some turnouts along the Alpine Loop nearby, either up or down the Alpine Loop road, and you can park in the turnouts.  &lt;b&gt;Do not park in the campground or at the Aspen Grove Alumni Resort&lt;/b&gt;, you will be ticketed or towed.  So to avoid the hassles of parking on a weekend do one of these:  1) Arrive &lt;i&gt;very&lt;/i&gt; early 2) Carpool 3) Arrange to be taxied.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Mt. Timpanogos area is part of a &lt;a href=\"http://www.fs.fed.us/r4/uinta/passes/index.shtml\"&gt;Recreation Fee Demonstration&lt;/a&gt; area, $6 a day and payable at either end of the &lt;a href=\"http://saltlakecity.about.com/cs/thegreatoutdoors/a/alpineloop.htm\"&gt;Alpine Loop Scenic Highway&lt;/a&gt;.  It helps to have your 6 bucks ready to pay the fee. Season passes are also available and  credit cards and checks are accepted.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Nearby Provo Utah\'s weather (at 7000 feet lower)&lt;br&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://www.wunderground.com/US/UT/Provo.html\"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src=\"http://banners.wunderground.com/banner/bigwx_both_cond/language/www/US/UT/Provo.gif\"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://www.wunderground.com/US/UT/Provo.html\"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_6\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;CAMPING&lt;/h2&gt;If you want to camp out easy, you have a myriad of motels in the Provo, Orem, Pleasant Grove area.  There are some campgrounds on the &lt;a href=\"http://www.summitpost.org/canyon/188406/American-Fork-Canyon.html\"&gt;American Fork Canyon&lt;/a&gt; road although the&lt;b&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://www.utah.com/campground/amenities2228.htm\"&gt;Timpooneke campground&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/b&gt; would be the most convenient for those who will hike the Timpooneke trail.  It fills up fast on the weekends, however.  A fee is charged for camping overnight and it has restrooms and running water.  To access the Aspen Grove trailhead, you can continue driving over the Alpine Loop highway from American Fork Canyon (or drive up the North Fork of Provo Canyon, past Sundance Ski Resort).  There is camping available at Aspen Grove but it is on a very limited basis.  I have observed several people who simply stealth camped nearby the day before they went up the trail. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Driving a motorhome or towing a trailer is discouraged on the Alpine Highway - it is a steep and narrow road, with many tight corners and blind curves.  Please drive safely - several cars each year are driven (or inadvertently &lt;i&gt;forced&lt;/i&gt;) off the highway, and need to be winched back up by a tow truck.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If you want to do a little backpacking, there are several places to camp on both the Aspen Grove and the Timpooneke trail.  The best places to camp on the Aspen Grove trail are found at the \"upper bench\" area (about 3/4ths of the way to Emerald Lake) just above the conclusion of the many zig zagging switchbacks. There are several decent places to camp but be forewarned that they generally are taken early on the weekends.   Places to camp near the Timpooneke trail are spaced adequately apart with the best camping in the area just as you enter the basin at about 10,000 feet.  Hennessey Hammock users can find many places to camp in the trees prior to timberline.  Water is plentiful on both trails but as usual, consider treating it prior to drinking by filtering or boiling it.   &lt;br&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_7\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;TRAILS&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;div class=\"image-left\" style=\"width: 506px;\" align=\"center\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"/summit-hut-comes-into-view/569054\"&gt;&lt;img style=\"\" alt=\"Summit hut comes into view\" src=\"/images/medium/569054.jpg\" height=\"375\" width=\"500\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=\"caption\"&gt;Closing in on the summit &lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br&gt;As mentioned earlier, there are two main trails that provide easy access to Timp\'s summit.  They are:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;TIMPOONEKE TRAIL:  See route section for a description&lt;br&gt;ASPEN GROVE Trail:  See route section for a description.&lt;br&gt;TIMPANOGOS LOOP HIKE: See route section for a description.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If you can park a car at one end (shuttle), an interesting hike is to go from TH to TH, a distance of about 12 miles. Even better is to go up Timpooneke, then down Aspen Grove to a little-used but excellent trail will take you around Roberts\' Ridge and over to Horse Flat and the Alpine Loop summit, where you can take the Great Western Trail back to Timpooneke.  This is a 16-mile loop detailed in the Routes section as the Timpanogos Loop Hike. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Runners regularly train on Timp.  They used to post their records in wikipedia until wikipedia decided that running records were not encyclopedic enough for them, so here are some interesting stats (if you have your own record, &lt;i&gt;please&lt;/i&gt; comment!):&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The record to the summit via Timpooneke is 1:15:36, established August 12, 2006 by Danny Moody, a member of the Sojourners Running Club. The fastest documented time to the summit and back via the Timpooneke Trail is that of Phil Lowry, 48, of Mapleton, Utah, who did the round-trip in 2:55 on August 9, 2009.  Multiple uninterrupted summit records include that of Lowry, who has run to the summit and back twice in succession in 6:45 via the Timpooneke trail, and the endurance record of David Crockett of Saratoga Springs, Utah. He is the only person who has ever climbed the mountain five times, back to back. He did so on the Timpooneke trail on August 18-19, 2006. Youth records include that of Phillip Lowry III, at age 13, who ran to the summit in 2:29:30 on July 31, 2008, and Ian Lowry,  at age 16, who reached the summit in 2:17 on August 11, 2008.  On August 18, 2007 James Leblow, at age 12, reached the summit in 2:41:28 via a circuitous route on the Timpooneke and the Emerald Lake cutoff trails. More recently,  Kaden Hunter ran to the summit from the Timpooneke trailhead on July 26, 2010 in 2:13:40. As you can see, there are many of all ages that can put up great times and yet I am very proud of my own time last year at the ripe old age of 72 when I hiked to the summit in 4.5 hours.  I\'ll take it and regardless of how long any of you take to reach the summit, it isn\'t the time it took, its the fact that you had the resolve to get it done and you can pat yourself on the back.   I\'ve also seen the cross country teams from local highschools run to the summit and back.  Kudos to all of them.&lt;br&gt;&lt;div class=\"image-left\" style=\"width: 506px;\" align=\"center\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"/the-trail/569057\"&gt;&lt;img style=\"\" alt=\"The trail\" src=\"/images/medium/569057.jpg\" height=\"375\" width=\"500\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=\"caption\"&gt;Summit Trail&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_8\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt; Wildlife and other information about Mt.

It is easy to accept this description after you\'ve experienced the cascades of tumbling water and realize that the vast cirques and basins were gouged into this huge mountain by abundance of glacial ice within the not so distant past.   &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Deer, moose, mountain goats, marmots and pikas (coneys) are inhabitants of this area.  I\'m sure there are bear and probably cougars (not the BYU kind) also but I have no personal &lt;br&gt;experience with bear information in this area but I indeed have seen many BYU cougars on the trails. :  )    On my last trip up the Timpooneke trail, I saw three deer and about a dozen mountain goat and too many pikas to count. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Phil Lowry has encountered moose, both cow and bull, over 50 times, mostly on the Timpooneke Trail.  They are pretty accustomed to humans, but can be VERY aggressive.  They are by far the biggest four-legged danger on the mountain.  Give them a wide berth.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Recently (see summit log) robtvahle mentioned that he saw moose on the Timpooneke trail and the goat pictures provided here were taken by &lt;b&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://www.summitpost.org/user_page.php?user_id=34951\"&gt;Kris247&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/b&gt; who has this incredible picture featured to the left.  He has taken some special shots and my favorite is the one at the far left of a goat descending a cliff face. Nice work DB.  The other shot, taken by Phil Lowry while actually taking a break from running to the summit, features the three highlights of Timpanogos: goats, flowers, and one of the main hiking trails 1500 feet below (the trail is the Emerald Lake cutoff from the Timpooneke Trail).  &lt;div class=\"image-left\" style=\"width: 206px;\" align=\"center\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"/timp-goat/430547\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Timp Goat\" src=\"/images/small/430547.jpg\" height=\"150\" width=\"200\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=\"caption\"&gt;Timpanogos Kid&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;USGS quad: Timpanogos Cave&lt;br&gt;Two good books on Mt.

It has an interesting description of the history of the summit \"shack\" (as locals call it) which adorns Timp\'s main peak.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;From the summit of Mt. Timpanogos, you can see many of the other meaningful summits of the Wasatch.  To the south you see Mt. Nebo and to the north you can make out Lone Peak,  the Pfeifferhorn, Broads Fork, Sunrise, and Dromedary Peaks.  From the summit of Mt. Timp, you have an impressive drop that looks straight down on Emerald Lake below which demonstrates the exposure on the northeast side.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;An interesting note  is that the \'92 Utah Mt. Everest expedition used Mt. Timpanogos as a training ground during a previous  winter.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I might add that I\'ve been up this mountain twice and everytime I look up at it, it tempts me to want to be up on top again.   The summit is a small point in the long ridge about midway on the mountain. I have many pictures to post.  I\'ve stood on top of both Mt. Rainier and Mt. Timpanogos and although they are totally different, they both have that magic quality that makes you say to yourself, \"I want to stand on top of that\" . &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;One additional attraction that is easily worth a side trip to is &lt;a href=\"http://www.utah.com/hike/timp_cave.htm\"&gt;Timpanogas Cave National Monument.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_9\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;\"That guy\" - Ben Woolsey&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;div class=\"image-left\" style=\"width: 506px;\" align=\"center\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://www.utah.com/hike/timp_cave.htm\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=\"/ben-woolsey-on-oct-7th/947175\"&gt;&lt;img style=\"\" alt=\"Ben Woolsey on Oct 7th\" src=\"/images/medium/947175.JPG\" height=\"375\" width=\"500\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=\"caption\"&gt;Ben Woolsey - over 725 summits and counting&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Ben Woolsey, aka \"That Guy\" a retired postal worker from Utah County, regularly places and maintains the summit register on the mountain.   (Personal note, I met him on August 16, 2013 as he was coming down from the summit which he had made in about 3 hours.  Pretty doggone good for a guy 71 years old at the time.  He hikes the mountain on Monday, Weds, Fri, and Saturday so keep your eyes open for him and thank him for the effort he puts into maintaining the summit register.)  He now has over 705 summits of the mountain and will keep pushing that record higher and higher.  The Daily Herald recently had this superb story about him. Lick &lt;a href=\"http://www.heraldextra.com/lifestyles/recreation/orem-man-summits-mt-timpanogos-more-than-times/article_b6302965-8974-5fc5-8a9b-6dabcef662f8.html\"&gt;HERE&lt;/a&gt;. Stay tuned as I update the total.  &lt;br&gt;As of late October 2015, the number was 789. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;72 summit visits in one year?   Ben achieved 72 summits in 2014 to celebrate his 72nd year.  Read the neat article &lt;a href=\"http://www.ksl.com/?nid=1288&amp;amp;sid=32303558\"&gt;HERE&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;I hope the link will remain working for awhile since it is a very nice article about Ben and his dedication to hiking to the summit on a regular basis. But wait, there\'s more: Ben summitted 100 times in 2015.  You read  that right, 100  times.  Many a day he made the round trip to the summit twice, in the same day.  CONGRAT\'S BEN, YOU ARE AMAZING.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://fox13now.com/2015/07/24/73-year-old-man-hikes-mount-timpanogos-for-700th-time/\"&gt;Here is a TV link&lt;/a&gt; (for as long as it will stay up)  that is a nice tribute to Ben. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Phil Lowry is another who has summitted over 400 times.  Anyone else?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This page, adds a trip report to the collection, &lt;a href=\"http://www.idahosummits.com/timp/timp.htm\"&gt;so check it out.&lt;br&gt;Neat pic of Mt.

Timpanogos is, you also have to consider the many peaks that also are part of the mountain and now have pages here on Summitpost. This section  provides links to those &lt;br&gt;peaks that will make it easier for you to know which ones are part of the Mt.

Prominence Peaks in USA&lt;/h2&gt;I won\'t try and explain the concept of Prominence but it is worthy to note that Mt. Timpanogos is one of the (8) 5000 ft. prominence peaks in the state of Utah.  Aaron Maizlish has put together this &lt;a href=\"http://www.peaklist.org/USmaps/WesternUSSummits.gif\"&gt;fantastic map&lt;/a&gt; of the Western United States showing the peaks that qualify for this special rating.

A few are: Provo peak,  Spanish Fork peak,  Loafer Mtn,  West Mtn,  Lake Mtn,  Boulter Peak, and a few others.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_13\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Avalanche Danger&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;div class=\"image-left\" style=\"width: 506px;\" align=\"center\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"/timpanogos-sunrise/88527\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Timpanogos Sunrise\" src=\"/images/medium/88527.jpg\" height=\"369\" width=\"500\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=\"caption\"&gt;Joseph Bullough\'s gorgeous sunrise shot &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Even though this occurred two years ago, this story should serve as a &lt;br&gt;reminder that this big beautiful mountain has a very dark side in winter.  This year, 2008, we are seeing a huge snow season and so reading this might serve to remind us of avalanche danger: &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;January 2nd 2006&lt;br&gt;Snowshoer lost in avalanche; boarder missing&lt;br&gt;By Jason Bergreen &lt;a href=\"http://www.sltrib.com/utah/ci_3361603\"&gt;The Salt Lake Tribune&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Two people were missing in Utah\'s snow-packed mountains Saturday night - a Salt Lake County snowshoer swept away in an avalanche in the Timpanogos Mountains and a teenage snowboarder who disappeared after apparently venturing into an out-of-bounds area of Snowbird Ski resort.&lt;br&gt;At 11:30 p.m., search and rescue teams in Salt Lake and Utah counties were still searching for the teen, who was reported missing in the Mineral Basin area, said Utah County Sgt. Darren Gilbert.&lt;br&gt;The teen, who was believed to be snowboarding out of bounds at the Snowbird ski resort, was reported missing about 6 p.m. Gilbert said poor weather and visibility was hampering searchers, who set up command at Tibble Fork Reservoir.&lt;br&gt;Avalanche danger is high in the area in which the teen went missing, Gilbert said.&lt;br&gt;A winter storm forced the Utah County Search and Rescue Team to call off the search for the snowshoer at 6 p.m., about 4 1/2 hours after he and a friend were caught in the slide on the back side of the mountain near Emerald Lake.&lt;br&gt;The search was to resume this morning, according Gilbert, who added, \"We\'re holding high hopes at this time.\"&lt;br&gt;The man, whose name was not released, was reported missing by his friend, Jeff Frederick, 32, of Salt Lake City, who was able to ride out the avalanche and contact police dispatchers by cellular phone.&lt;br&gt;Frederick\'s sister, Tamara Love, said she was told her brother got caught in some trees and was able to stop himself in the slide.&lt;br&gt;Gilbert said Frederick searched the area but could not find his friend, who Love said was a man named Marshal. The men were neighbors and members of the same LDS ward, she said.&lt;br&gt;\"We\'re just so sick about not knowing of Marshal,\" Love said.&lt;br&gt;Low-lying clouds and snow prevented the search and rescue team from reaching the site, Gilbert said. At 4:30 p.m., when conditions cleared, a Department of Public Safety helicopter spotted Frederick and was able to land near him, about 1,000 feet below the slide.&lt;br&gt;Frederick, who was uninjured, was flown to the Aspen Grove trailhead several miles from Emerald Lake. Love said her brother had returned home by 9 p.m. and met with his church bishop.&lt;br&gt;Frederick liked to go to the mountains almost every weekend, Love said.&lt;br&gt;Gilbert described Frederick and the other man as fairly competent backcountry adventurers, but noted they did not carry avalanche beacons on this trip. The sergeant said it took the pair about 5 1/2 hours to reach the area near where the avalanche occurred.&lt;br&gt;Investigators have not determined what triggered the avalanche, but Utah Avalanche Center director Bruce Tremper said about 92 percent of slides are caused by the victim or his party.&lt;br&gt;Tremper said the avalanche danger near Emerald Lake was \"considerable\" Saturday - meaning natural avalanches are possible and human-triggered avalanches are probable - and was expected to reach \"high\" - when both types are likely - by today. The forecast for Saturday night was expected to be warm, around 32-degrees, but windy and snowy all night.&lt;br&gt;The search for the missing snowshoer was in the same general area where three friends were killed in an avalanche Dec. 26, 2003.&lt;br&gt;Rod Newberry, 20, of Pleasant Grove; Adam Merz, 18; and Mike Hebert, 19, both of Orem, were among a group of five friends swept down as they snowboarded in the Roberts Horn Chute of Aspen Grove, about 2 1/2 miles north of the Sundance Ski Resort. There have been no avalanche deaths this year in Utah. But last year eight people were killed in the state, making it one of the deadliest avalanche seasons since records have been kept.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As a follow up to this tragic story, Phil Lowry and Joey Dempster, along with family volunteers and members of Utah County SAR, spent a good deal of time in May 2006 poring through the melting snow looking for any sign of the dead snowshoer.  As the month progressed, more items were found.  Snowshoes.  A bite valve to a camelback.  A ski pole.  Finally in June members of Utah County SAR found his body some 1800 feet below the PLS (point last seen).    &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Please be careful on Timp in winter. &lt;a name=\"chapter_14\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Nearby Timpanogos Cave Nat\'l Monument&lt;/h2&gt;You can find more information on this nice side trip &lt;a href=\"http://www.nps.gov/tica\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;here.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Here\'s a &lt;a href=\"http://www.americansouthwest.net/utah/mount_timpanogos\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;link  to an overview map of the area&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Additional info can be found.....&lt;a href=\"http://www.americansouthwest.net/utah/timpanogos_cave/national_monument.html\"&gt;HERE.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div class=\"image-left\" style=\"width: 506px;\" align=\"center\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"/february-5th-2005-the/88794\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"February 5th, 2005 - The...\" src=\"/images/medium/88794.jpg\" height=\"375\" width=\"500\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=\"caption\"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_15\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Stewart Falls&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;div class=\"image-left\" style=\"width: 493px;\" align=\"center\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"/on-the-flank-of-mt/20170\"&gt;&lt;img style=\"\" alt=\"On the flank of Mt....\" src=\"/images/original/20170.JPG\" height=\"650\" width=\"487\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=\"caption\"&gt;Stewart Falls &lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Approached from the parking lot for the Aspen Grove trail, the trail for Stewart Falls is found just to the right of the restrooms on the south end of  the parking lot. It is about 1.9 miles to the falls and has about 330 feet of elevation gain going to the falls and 450 feet of gain coming back so expect close to 800 feet round trip with 3.8 miles of effort.   This is a popular trail on any nice summer day. I think I counted over 100 people of all ages on my recent visit (july 22). Don\'t climb near the falls, fatalities have occurred here in the past. Enjoy the view and the nice workout the hike provides.  Best done in late spring to when the snow flies in the fall.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Scout Falls is worth a visit when the snowmelt is in full swing.  Scout Falls is about a mile and a half up the Timpanooke Trail and is marked by a sign at the top of the first major switchback. &lt;br&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_16\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Books&lt;/h2&gt;There are two books that have coverage of Mt.

The Legend is about an Indian Princess and an Indian Chief  that were in love with each other. One day while the Chief was fighting in a war, an arrow hit him in his heart  and he died. When the Princess found out about his death, she climbed to the highest mountain she could find and jumped to her death. The spirits of the Chief and the Princess went into the mountain to be together forever as Mount Timpanogos. To this day they are still part of Timpanogos. If you look at the slopes of Timpanogos that faces Utah Valley then you can see the profile of the Indian Princess laying down. If you were southwest of Timpanogos in Utah Valley and looked northeast to Timpanogos you will be able to see the profile of the Chief\'s face. The location of the face is just a little bit north of the summit. In the caves of Timpanogos there is a heart called The Great Heart of Timpanogos. This heart is the combinded hearts of the Chief and the Princess.&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td valign=\"bottom\" style=\"padding-top: 6px;\" colspan=\"2\"&gt;&lt;span style=\"font-size: 9px; color: #888;\"&gt;Posted Dec 3, 2005 3:56 am&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;table border=\"0\" width=\"745\" class=\"messages\" style=\"margin-left: 30px;\"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td rowspan=\"4\" valign=\"top\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/styles/layout/reply_arrow.gif\"&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td width=\"110\" align=\"left\" valign=\"top\" style=\"padding-top: 6px;\"&gt;&lt;a name=\"143273\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a class=\"dis_user_lnk\" href=\"/users/mtn-pika/32686\"&gt;mtn_pika&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td valign=\"top\" style=\"padding-top: 6px;\"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Re: Untitled Comment&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td align=\"right\" valign=\"top\" nowrap style=\"font-size: 10px;\"&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td valign=\"top\" rowspan=\"2\" align=\"left\" style=\"padding-top: 6px;\"&gt;&lt;p class=\"disc_avatar\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"/users/mtn-pika/32686\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"mtn_pika\" width=\"50\" height=\"50\" border=\"0\" src=\"/images/avatars/209847.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=\"font-size: 9px; color: #888;\"&gt;Voted 10/10&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td colspan=\"2\" style=\"padding-top: 6px;\"&gt;I love this!

Caine Alder, the gentleman quoted in the article, has apparently since died.  Phil Lowry did tell me where the access to the old trail segment is, and I found it, but after heading up the old trail through the overgrowth, and switchbacking the other direction awhile I got to a rock ledge where the trail seemed to disappear into a bunch of game trails.  Does anyone know where the old trail goes from there?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;While I\'m posting, I\'ll add that I heard that after 50 years the Forest Service can consider structures to be historical.  The Timpanogos Shelter at Emerald Lake is now over 50 years.  It would be nice if people asked to Forest Service to restore it.  TERT director Glen Meyer is encouraging them to do so.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Thanks.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;--&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Paul W.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;http://user.xmission.com/~wake/timp.html&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td valign=\"bottom\" style=\"padding-top: 6px;\" colspan=\"2\"&gt;&lt;span style=\"font-size: 9px; color: #888;\"&gt;Posted Aug 11, 2014 11:08 am&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;table border=\"0\" width=\"745\" class=\"messages\" style=\"margin-left: 30px;\"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td rowspan=\"4\" valign=\"top\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/styles/layout/reply_arrow.gif\"&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td width=\"110\" align=\"left\" valign=\"top\" style=\"padding-top: 6px;\"&gt;&lt;a name=\"490033\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a class=\"dis_user_lnk\" href=\"/users/pauldw/111533\"&gt;pauldw&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td valign=\"top\" style=\"padding-top: 6px;\"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Re: Anyone Know About the Old Aspen Grove Trail?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td align=\"right\" valign=\"top\" nowrap style=\"font-size: 10px;\"&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td valign=\"top\" rowspan=\"2\" align=\"left\" style=\"padding-top: 6px;\"&gt;&lt;p class=\"disc_avatar\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"/users/pauldw/111533\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"pauldw\" width=\"50\" height=\"50\" border=\"0\" src=\"/images/avatars/935784.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=\"font-size: 9px; color: #888;\"&gt;Hasn\'t voted&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td colspan=\"2\" style=\"padding-top: 6px;\"&gt;I went back up later and figured it out.

It\'s a justifiably popular ascent, particularly among day hikers in the area, with the summit offering magnificent views of Tuolumne Meadows to the west, the Cathedral Range to the south, and the Sierra crest to the east.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The summit is most commonly reached by a short &lt;a href=\"http://summitpost.com/mountains/route_link.pl/route_id/1240/object_id/1571\"&gt;walk-up route on the east&lt;/a&gt;.  Another popular option is a scramble up the low angle slabs of the &lt;a href=\"http://summitpost.com/mountains/route_link.pl/route_id/1759/object_id/1571\"&gt;south east face&lt;/a&gt;, rated class 3.  The dome also offers a variety of technical routes; Roper\'s 1976 edition of &lt;i&gt;The Climber\'s Guide to the High Sierra&lt;/i&gt; lists no less than sixteen.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;table class=\"inline_image_thumbs\"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=26065\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/26065.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=29724\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/29724.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=14890\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/14890.JPG\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=28425\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/28425.JPG\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=62920\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/62920.JPG\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_2\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Getting There&lt;/h2&gt;The dome is located directly off Tioga Road, immediately next to the Dog Lake/Young Lakes trailhead in &lt;a href=\"http://summitpost.com/mountains/mountain_link.pl/mountain_id/759\"&gt;Tuolumne Meadows&lt;/a&gt;. A signed trail for the dome leads around the backside of the dome, eventually winding around to reach the summit.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The dome can also be approached by a slightly shorter trail on the east, which is signed only for Dog Lake.  The trail is located half a mile east of the Young Lakes trailhead; there\'s space for roughly two cars to park off the side of the road.  This trailhead is easy to miss!&lt;br&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_3\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Red Tape&lt;/h2&gt;Permits are not required for day hikes, but a wilderness permit is required for overnight visits. This can be obtained from any ranger station in the park. The nearest location is the permit building just east of the Tuolumne Meadows campground, located just off the road that leads to the Tuolumne Lodge, on the right hand side.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Note that camping is technically illegal within a mile of Tioga Road, and within four miles of any trailhead. Because of the summit\'s close proximity both to the road and to the popular Tuolumne Meadows area, it is almost always climbed as a day hike.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;table class=\"inline_image_thumbs\"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=27128\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/27128.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_4\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;When To Climb&lt;/h2&gt;Due to the winter closure of Tioga Road, Lembert Dome is most commonly climbed between May and November.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_5\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Camping&lt;/h2&gt;The closest legal camping can be found in the Tuolumne Meadows backpacker\'s campground, located a few hundred yards west of the dome, on the south side of Tioga Road.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_6\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Mountain Conditions&lt;/h2&gt;Current conditions can be found on the &lt;a href=\"http://www.nps.gov/yose/\"&gt;NPS page&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_7\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Etymology&lt;/h2&gt;\"The dome was named after John Baptist Lembert, a hermit who in the 1880s homesteaded a small parcel of land surrounding the soda springs west of the dome.  At this idyllic site Lembert raised angora goats until a severe winter depleted his stock; afterward, he collected butterflies and botanical specimens for museums.  In 1896 Lembert was murdered by a robber at his winter quarters below Yosemite Valley.\"&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;- Steve Roper, &lt;i&gt;Sierra High Route:  Traversing Timberline Country&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\"John Baptist Lembert settled in Tuolumne Meadows sometime before 1882; he was visited in that year by a member of the crew surveying the original Tioga Road.  Lembert was living in an eight-by-ten-foot cabin built directly atop one of the soda springs; water bubbled up in the center of the cabin. (\'Surveying the Tioga Road,\' &lt;i&gt;YNN&lt;/i&gt; 27, no. 9: 109--112.)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Lembert raised angora goats, until he lost them in a snowstorm in the winter of 1889-90.  Thereafter he made his living by collecting butterflies and botanical specimens, which he sold to museums. On June 28, 1895, he gained legal possession of the property when he homesteaded 160 acres:  the southwest quarter of sec. 5, T. 1 S., R. 24 E.  He was murdered at his cabin in the Merced Canyon, below Yosemite Valley, in the winter of 1896-97.  The Soda Springs property was sold to the McCauley brothers in 1898 by Lembert\'s brother.  J. J. McCauley sold it to the Sierra Club in 1912, which in turn sold it to the National Park Service in 1973.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The dome was called \'Soda Spr. Dome\' on the Wheeler Survey atlas sheet 56D, 1878-79.  John Muir called it \'Glacier Rock.\' The name was misspelled \'Lambert\' on many early maps and references.  It is spelled that way on the first five editions of the &lt;i&gt;Mt. Lyell&lt;/i&gt; 30\' map, 1901-22; corrected on the edition of 1927.\"&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;- Peter Browning, &lt;i&gt;Place Names of the Sierra Nevada&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_8\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;External Links&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://climber.org/TripReports/ByPeakL.html#lembert\"&gt;climber.org trip reports&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://hiking.adampaul.com/lembert03.shtml\"&gt;01 July 2003 - fun dome hike!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;                     &lt;a name=\"chapter_9\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Images&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div align=\"center\"&gt;&lt;table id=\"my_images\"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/the-top/331010/c-151389\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"The top\" src=\"/images/square/331010.JPG\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/tuolumne-river/960673/c-151389\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Tuolumne River\" src=\"/images/square/960673.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/fairview-dome-and-lembert-dome/777317/c-151389\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Fairview Dome and Lembert Dome\" src=\"/images/square/777317.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/lembert-dome-s-south-slope/22416/c-151389\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Lembert Dome\\\'s South Slope ....\" src=\"/images/square/22416.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/lembert-dome-25-july-2004/62920/c-151389\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Lembert Dome- 25 July, 2004\" src=\"/images/square/62920.JPG\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/lembert-dome-view-west/539531/c-151389\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Lembert Dome View-West\" src=\"/images/square/539531.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/take-a-hike-son-get-out-and-stay-out/634083/c-151389\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Take a hike son.

Most of the information on the page was written by him. I will do my best to maintain the page at the quality that he has.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As you arrive in Grand Teton National Park from the north, Mt. Moran dominates the view.  In fact, when driving south from Yellowstone, Mt. Moran is often mistaken for the Grand Teton by tourists upon seeing the Teton range for the first time.   Unlike the other peaks which stand together in the middle of the range, Mt. Moran appears to stand alone, guarding the northern side of the Tetons.    &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Mt. Moran is named for Thomas Moran,  a famous frontier landscape artist, who was the friend and colleague of Dr. Ferdinand D. Hayden, the noteworthy surveyor of the west in the late 1800s.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Mt. Moran was first ascended by LeGrand Hardy, Ben C. Rich, and Bennet McNulty on July 22, 1922 via the Skillet Glacier.   On November 21, 1950, a DC-3 with 21 people aboard crashed into the mountain during a snowstorm at the 11,200 foot level above the Skillet Glacier, killing everyone including 7 children.    The wreckage and the bodies remain there to this day and climbers are reminded not to disturb the gravesite. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://www.tetonclimbinghistory.com/index.html\"&gt;CLICK HERE TO VIEW THE SUMMIT REGISTER ARCHIVE&lt;/a&gt;:  This site contains a collection of digital images of the Grand Teton National Park Summit Register Archive including the register for Mount Moran.   The summit registers were maintained from about the late-1920s into the 1980s and they form a unique repository of Teton climbing history.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;All the routes to the summit are technical, the most noteworthy of which will be described later.   Whichever the route, Mt. Moran is a spectacular peak offering an entire season of mountaineering challenges. &lt;a name=\"chapter_2\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Getting There&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;div align=\"center\" class=\"image-right\" style=\"width: 506px;\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"/mount-moran-approach-and-cmc/23660\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Mount Moran approach and CMC...\" height=\"375\" width=\"500\" src=\"/images/medium/23660.JPG\" style=\"\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=\"caption\"&gt;Approach and route via the CMC. Photo and editing by Alan Ellis&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br&gt;Mt. Moran is located in the northwest corner of Wyoming in &lt;a href=\"http://www.nps.gov/grte/\"&gt;Grand Teton National Park&lt;/a&gt;.   Most climbs are approached from Leigh Canyon or the Falling Ice Glacier gulch via the Jenny Lake area.  From Jackson, Wyoming drive 12 miles north on Hwy 191 to Moose Junction.  You will enter the park during the first 3 miles.   Turn left (west) on Teton Park Road and drive approximately 9 miles to the South Jenny Lake Junction.  Follow the signs to the String Lake picnic area.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Please refer to the left side-bar for approaches to the specific routes.&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div align=\"center\" class=\"image\" style=\"width: 356px;\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=883684\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/medium/883684.JPG\" alt=\"Mount Moran seen from Leigh Lake on the approach\" style=\"width: 350px; height: 262px;\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=\"caption\"&gt;Mount Moran seen from Leigh Lake on the approach. Photo by Jackson Herring&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_3\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Noteworthy Routes&lt;/h2&gt;With the easiest route being 5.4 Grade III, and it\'s remoteness, this mountain should not to be taken lightly.   The most famous route is the Direct South Buttress which is included in the Fifty Classic Climbs of North America by Steve Roper and Allen Steck.  Here are some of the more noteworthy routes with first ascent (FA):&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div align=\"center\" class=\"image\" style=\"width: 506px;\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=862754\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/medium/862754.jpg\" alt=\"The CMC face of Mount Moran seen from halfway up Drizzlepuss, on the descent\" style=\"width: 500px; height: 667px;\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=\"caption\"&gt;The CMC face of Mount Moran seen from Drizzlepuss, the crux of the CMC route. Photo taken by Jackson Herring AKA Panama Red&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://www.summitpost.com/show/route_link.pl/route_id/2343/object_id/1599\"&gt;&lt;b&gt;CMC Route:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;   5.5, Grade III.  The most popular route to the summit offers a wonderful high camp site, a 1500 foot scramble, then a 1000 foot ascent of steep slabs along a vertical black dike.   In addition, there is a technical pitch which must be led on the descent to gain the top of Drizzlepuss on the way back to the CMC camp.   This pitch is 5.7 or 5.5 depending on the variation, and is the most exposed section of the entire route.   The CMC route is normally climbed in 3 days. Day 1 is the approach to the high camp (4-6 hours). The summit day is usually between 10 and 14 hours round trip. Hike out on day 3.   Due to the long duration and relative remoteness of this mountain, the CMC route on Mount Moran is considered the most difficult standard route in the Tetons.   The CMC name is from the Chicago Mountaineering Club whose members Paul Petzoldt, Joseph Hawkes, Earl Clark, and Harold Plumley, made the first ascent of the route on June 25, 1941.   &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The first ski descent of the CMC route on Mt. Moran was by Doug Coombs, Bill Dyer, and Kent McBride on May 16, 2002.

There will be a nondescript  path which can be followed on the north side of the creek for the next mile and a half to the talus slope below Laughing Lion Falls.

July is the driest summer month while June is the wettest.   However, that is an average over several years.  It can storm and rain for days on end during any month.   Like typical Rockies weather, the Tetons are notorious for violent afternoon thunderstorms, so get an early start.   &lt;div align=\"center\" class=\"image-right\" style=\"width: 156px;\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"/first-turns-on-the-skillet/107131\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"First turns on the Skillet...\" height=\"200\" width=\"150\" src=\"/images/small/107131.jpg\" style=\"\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=\"caption\"&gt;Skiing the Skillet Glacier. Photo by Gramps&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt; Plan on being off the mountain by early afternoon.    However, it has also been known to storm at any time of the day including early in the morning.    Sometimes the weather clears and high pressure moves in for several days of storm-free climbing.    Check &lt;a href=\"http://www.mountainweather.com/\"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; for current weather conditions.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Mt. Moran is also climbed in the dead of winter by experienced winter mountaineers.   The first winter ascent was via the Northeast Ridge on December 19, 1966 by Tom Stevenson, George Lowe, Mike Lowe, Dennis Caldwell, Tom Spencer, Court Richards, and Bill Conrod.

Jenny Lake campground has 49 sites for tents only and fills very fast.   Other campgrounds: Gros Ventre - 360 sites, Signal Mountain -  86 sites, Colter Bay -  350 sites, Flagg Ranch - 175 sites, and Lizard Creek - 60 sites.   Colter Bay and Flagg Ranch each have over 100 full RV hookup sites. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div align=\"center\" class=\"image-left\" style=\"width: 206px;\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=817115\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/medium/817115.JPG\" alt=\"Sunrise on the CMC\" style=\"width: 200px; height: 150px;\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=\"caption\"&gt;The CMC backcountry campsite. Photo by Jackson Herring &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;All backcountry camping must have a permit as described above.  The best backcountry site for a high camp is the CMC campsite, located at 10,000 ft at the top of Falling Ice Glacier Gulch and below Drizzlepuss.    The maximum stay at the CMC campsite is two nights.   Water can be found in a spring to the south of the CMC campsites in the wide gully.  In late season, the spring yields little water.   You can also get water at the base of the Falling Ice glacier via a 20 minute traverse north of the CMC campsites.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div align=\"center\" class=\"image-left\" style=\"width: 206px;\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"/american-alpine-club/16562\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"American Alpine Club...\" height=\"150\" width=\"200\" src=\"/images/small/16562.jpg\" style=\"\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=\"caption\"&gt;American Alpine Club\'s Climber\'s Ranch. Photo by Alan Ellis&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br&gt;The best option to camping before your climb is to stay at the &lt;a href=\"https://americanalpineclub.org/gtcr\"&gt;American Alpine Club\'s Climber&rsquo;s Ranch&lt;/a&gt; located 7 miles past Moose Junction on Teton Park Road.   The Ranch offers very rustic accommodations for only $20/per night.    Very rustic means you bring your own bedding, mattress, etc., and you will be sharing a cabin with other climbers.  Showers and a cooking area are available.   Lodging is on a first come, first served basis but reservations are accepted. You can make an &lt;a href=\"https://americanalpineclub.org/gtcr_reservations\"&gt;online reservation here&lt;/a&gt; or call (307) 733-7271 between June 1 and September 30.    You do not have to be a member of the American Alpine Club to stay there; however, the AAC rate is only $10.00/night.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li type=\"DISC\"&gt;Grand Teton Climbing Ranch&lt;br&gt;ATTN: Manager&lt;br&gt;P.O.

Expect any type of conditions any time of the year, including, storms, snow, and ice.   Temperatures can vary from moderate to sub-freezing.  July is considered the best month to climb with the least average precipitation.   Rock fall is very common in the Tetons and Mt. Moran is no exception.   Trailhead elevations are approximately 6800-7000 ft and tree line is at approximately 9000 ft.   The Jenny Lake Ranger Station is the headquarters for Teton climbing.   Call the ranger station at (307) 739-3343 (summer) or (307) 739-3309 (winter) for current conditions.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Here is a great link for up-to-date route conditions on Mt.

The ranch offers very rustic accommodations for only $8.00/night.  It is within walking distance to the central peak\'s trailhead.

Lyell&lt;/a&gt;, and just slightly shorter.  This peak requires a fairly long approach  to any of its routes, but the route from &lt;a href=\"http://www.summitpost.com/mountains/mountain_link.pl?mountain_id=759\"&gt;Tuolumne Meadows&lt;/a&gt; is probably the easiest of the bunch, at around 13 miles and 3500 feet of elevation gain (most of the gain comes in the last 4-5 miles).   You will likely cross the Lyell Glacier on your way up if approaching from the Northeast, and for those that care, the Lyell Glacier is the 2nd largest glacier in the Sierra (Like most of the others, it has been melting fast).  &lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;table class=\"inline_image_thumbs\"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=20220\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/20220.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=23419\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/23419.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=23420\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/23420.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=30482\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/30482.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=62893\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/62893.JPG\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_2\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Getting There&lt;/h2&gt;The  easiest place to start an ascent of Mt. Maclure is from Tuolumne Meadows, at the eastern trailhead for the John Muir Trail.  This trailhead is located along the road leading to the Tuolumne Meadows Lodge.  There is a large parking area there.  Tuolumne Meadows is alongside Highway 120, at about 8,600 feet elevation.  The trailhead is on the south side of the parking lot.  Follow the trail for about 1/2 mile, until just after crossing the Lyell Fork of the Tuolumne River, and then tun left.  Follow this pleasant, mostly flat trail along the river trail for about 8 miles more, and it will begin to climb.  The trail works it way up toward Donohue Pass, and just before you cross the river for the last time, don\'t.  Stay on the west side and continue up the drainage.  The peak will soon come into sight.  Head for the toe of the glacier, and then choose your route.&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;table class=\"inline_image_thumbs\"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=49311\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/49311.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=16018\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/16018.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=16019\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/16019.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=28726\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/28726.JPG\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=23753\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/23753.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_3\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Red Tape&lt;/h2&gt;To enter Yosemite National Park, you must pay $20 for a 7-day pass, or $40 for an annual pass (Yosemite only).  The other option is the &lt;b&gt;America the Beautiful-National Parks and Federal Recreational Lands Annual Pass&lt;/b&gt; which gets you entrance to all of the National Parks for $80 per year.  If you are dayhiking, there is no need for a wilderness permit.  If you plan to bivy, you will need a wilderness permit, which may be hard to get, as this is a quota trail.  For complete details check the &lt;a href=\"http://www.nps.gov/yose/planyourvisit/feesandreservations.htm\"&gt;NPS Yosemite site&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;a name=\"chapter_4\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;When To Climb&lt;/h2&gt;The best time to climb this peak is when HIghway 120 is open, otherwise the approach is real long.  Generally, Highway 120 is open May to October, sometimes earlier, sometimes later.  To know for sure before you go, check in with the &lt;a href=\"http://www.dot.ca.gov/hq/roadinfo/\"&gt;California DOT&lt;/a&gt; for the latest road conditions.  Early season, expect lots of snow in a normal year due to the high elevation.&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;table class=\"inline_image_thumbs\"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=41200\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/41200.JPG\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=33445\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/33445.JPG\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=41192\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/41192.JPG\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_5\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Camping&lt;/h2&gt;If you can get a wilderness permit, you may camp in the wilderness along the way.  There are many popular sites along the Tuolumne River, and some good spots after Donohue Pass alongside the many tarns and seasonal streams.  If you\'re dayhiking (best plan), there is camping in &lt;a href=\"http://www.summitpost.com/mountains/mountain_link.pl?mountain_id=759\"&gt;Tuolumne Meadows&lt;/a&gt;, and this site offers comprehensive information on camping in Tuolumne, and local weather as well.  Also close by is the campground at Saddlebag Lake, and a couple of small campgrounds just outside the eastern border of the park along Highway 120. &lt;br&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_6\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Mountain Conditions&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://www.timetemperature.com/cgi-bin/getttw/getttw.cgi&amp;lt;br%20/&amp;gt;%0D%0A?theme=default&amp;amp;user=default&amp;amp;forecast=zone&amp;amp;zipcode=&amp;amp;place=Lee+vining&amp;lt;br%20/&amp;gt;%0D%0A&amp;amp;state=ca&amp;amp;country=us&amp;amp;&amp;amp;metric=0\"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src=\"http://www.timetemperature.com/cgi-bin/getttw/hwimage.cgi?&amp;lt;br%20/&amp;gt;%0D%0Atheme=default&amp;amp;user=default&amp;amp;forecast=zone&amp;amp;zipcode=&amp;amp;place=Lee+vining&amp;lt;br%20/&amp;gt;%0D%0A&amp;amp;state=ca&amp;amp;country=us&amp;amp;bgc=&amp;amp;tc=&amp;amp;t=&amp;amp;metric=0&amp;amp;display=\" border=\"0\" width=\"330\" height=\"203\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_7\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Etymology&lt;/h2&gt;This etymology info was posted by &lt;a href=\"http://www.summitpost.com/mountains/user_link.pl?user_id=370\"&gt;snwburd&lt;/a&gt;, and his contribution is appreciated.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\"Named before 1868 by the Whitney Survey. \'To the pioneer of American geology, William Maclure, one of the dominating peaks of the Sierra Nevada is very properly dedicated\' (Whitney, Yosemite Book, 1869, 101) .  Maclure (1763-1840) became known as \'the father of American geology\' because he produced, in 1809, the first geological map of the United States. The name is on the Hoffmann and Gardiner map of 1863-67 as \'Mt. Maclure.\' The Wheeler Survey atlas sheet 56D had it misspelled as \'McClure Pk.\' Both the mountain and the creek, called \'Fork,\' were misspelled as \'McClure\' on the first five edtions of the Mt. Lyell 30\' map, 1901-22; corrected to the proper spelling with the edition of 1927. The former \'McClure Fork\' (of the Merced River) was changed to \'Lewis Creek\' on the 30-minute map in 1944. The BGN in 1932 approved \'Maclure Glacier\' (on the north slope of Mount Maclure), and \'Maclure Lake\' (at the head of Maclure Creek). Neither name has thus far been on the maps.\" &lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;- Peter Browning,&lt;i&gt; Place Names of the Sierra Nevada&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\"The very first true geological map of any part of North America and one of the earliest such maps compiled was the work of William MacLure. Born in the town of Ayr, MacLure made a brief visit to New York before returning to London where he became wealthy with an import-export firm. After another brief stay in the US where he became an American citizen, he returned to Europe to indulge his new love of geology, traveling throughout the continent to collect geological specimens and textbooks on the subject. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Upon his return, MacLure investigated the Appalachian Mountain range (at that time practically the Western frontier of the nation) publishing Observations on the Geology of the United States in 1809. He also helped found the Philadelphia Academy of Natural Sciences, which he generously endowed and in which his valuable library is now safely ensconced.\" &lt;br&gt;-&lt;a href=\"http://www.britannia.com/celtic/scotland/greatscots/m.html\"&gt; Britannia (online)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;table class=\"inline_image_thumbs\"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=41198\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/41198.JPG\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_8\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;External Links&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://www.snwburd.com/bob/trip_reports/maclure_1.html\"&gt;Lyell/Maclure - Aug 7, 1998&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;                                                               &lt;div align=\"center\"&gt;&lt;a name=\"messages\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_9\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Additions and Corrections&lt;/h2&gt;[ &lt;a href=\"/object_discussion.php?type=vote_comments&amp;amp;object_id=151441&amp;amp;is_addition=1#vote_form\"&gt;Post an Addition or Correction&lt;/a&gt; ]&lt;table cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" style=\"width: 775px;\"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;table cellpadding=\"2\" cellspacing=\"2\" width=\"100%\"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;&lt;span class=\"pagertext\"&gt;Viewing: &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;-&lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt; of &lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td align=\"center\"&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td align=\"right\"&gt;    &lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;table border=\"0\" width=\"775\" class=\"messages\"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td width=\"110\" align=\"left\" valign=\"top\" style=\"padding-top: 6px;\"&gt;&lt;a name=\"333931\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a class=\"dis_user_lnk\" href=\"/users/iditarod81/50905\"&gt;iditarod81&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td valign=\"top\" style=\"padding-top: 6px;\"&gt;&lt;b&gt;National Parks pass correction.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td align=\"right\" valign=\"top\" nowrap style=\"font-size: 10px;\"&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td valign=\"top\" rowspan=\"2\" align=\"left\" style=\"padding-top: 6px;\"&gt;&lt;p class=\"disc_avatar\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"/users/iditarod81/50905\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"iditarod81\" width=\"50\" height=\"50\" border=\"0\" src=\"/images/avatars/943347.JPG\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=\"font-size: 9px; color: #888;\"&gt;Hasn\'t voted&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td colspan=\"2\" style=\"padding-top: 6px;\"&gt;The interagency pass is now $80 (not $50 as indicated in the description).

LeConte sits on the Sierra Crest roughly halfway between Mts. Langley and Muir, the two most southerly 14ers in California. By a mere 70 feet was it left out of that coveted list, and as a result it gets only a few dozen ascents a year instead of several hundred. The summit prominence is about 150ft high and 250ft in diameter, and class 3 by its easiest route, making it a challenging scramble much like Mt. Russell.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The peak was named in 1895 for Joseph LeConte, a professor of Geology and Natural History at the University of California. Many other Sierra features were named for the senior LeConte as well as his son, Joseph N. LeConte, including LeConte Canyon, LeConte Divide, LeConte Falls, and LeConte Point. Both were active in early Sierra exploration and charter members of the Sierra Club. See Etymology section below for more details. &lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;table class=\"inline_image_thumbs\"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=16376\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/16376.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=87169\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/87169.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_2\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Getting There&lt;/h2&gt;The nearest trailhead for Mt. LeConte is found at Whitney Portal. For more info on Whitney Portal, see the &lt;a href=\"http://www.summitpost.com/mountains/mountain_link.pl/mountain_id/45\"&gt;Mt. Whitney&lt;/a&gt; page.&lt;br&gt;The Meysan Lake TH is located about a mile below the Whitney Trail TH along the main road. A small parking area can be found on the south side of the road where a trailhead sign can be found. Follow the sometimes confusing trail through the campground and the summer cabins. Once the main trail is reached just past the cabins, it is very well maintained and nearly impossible to get lost. Follow the trail for almost four miles. The maintained trail ends in a meadow below the morraine surrounding Meysan Lake (which is above, but not visible). Several decent use trails can be followed for another mile to the shores of Meysan Lake. Follow around the east and south shores of the lake, then head up the broad funnel that leads to the upper plateau between Mts. LeConte and Mallory. The chute on the right (described by Secor) is the most straightforward, but may have snow/ice choking it even in late season. Class 3 climbing to an alternative chute several hundred yards to the left of this may offer easier access if you have no crampons or axe with you. The right side of the funnel has steep cliffs and lingering snows. Once up on the plateau, it is an easy (though tedious) hike south to the obvious base of the summit.&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;table class=\"inline_image_thumbs\"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=16374\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/16374.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=16375\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/16375.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_3\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Red Tape &amp;amp; Mountain Conditions&lt;/h2&gt;Unlike a hike up the Whitney Trail, you do not need a Whitney Zone stamp on your backcountry permit, or a dayhike permit if only going for the day. Wilderness permits are required for overnight stays, and quotas apply to the Meysan Lake Trail from May to September. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Everything you need to know about conditions, permits and regulations can be found on the &lt;a href=\"http://www.summitpost.org/show/mountain_link.pl/mountain_id/4859\"&gt;Eastern Sierra - Logisitcal Center&lt;/a&gt; page.&lt;br&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_4\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;When To Climb&lt;/h2&gt;Mt. LeConte is generally climbed in the summer months (June - Oct) when the Meysan Lakes Trail is snow-free. However, just as Mt. Whitney is climbed year-round, so could Mt. LeConte. Because there are fewer visitors in winter, the Meysan Lake Trail is likely to be less packed and more arduous than the Whitney Trail. . Climbs in the winter months should only be undertaken by those skilled in winter mountaineering. Be wary of avalanche dangers, particularly the steep slopes above Meysan Lake and below the upper plateau. &lt;br&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_5\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Camping&lt;/h2&gt;With a valid Wilderness Permit, camping is allowed in the region. Fine campsites are available at the end of the maintained trail in the meadow, or further south towards the small lakes found there. Camping at Meysan Lake is also possible - there is soft grass and flat areas for tent pads, but no trees for shade in the summer months. &lt;br&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_6\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Etymology&lt;/h2&gt;\"Joseph LeConte (1823-1901), professor of geology and natural history at the University of California, 1869-1901. &lt;br&gt;The falls was named in August 1892 \'Cross this ledge well to the right and gradually approach the river, which can be followed to the head of what is in many respects the most majestic cascade in the whole canyon, the LeConte Cascade, so named by us in honor of our most esteemed Professor, Joseph LeConte.\' (R. M. Price, \'Through the Tuolumne Canyon,\' &lt;i&gt;SCB&lt;/i&gt; 1, no. 6, May 1895: 204.) &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\'Some time ago those residents of the Lone Pine district who are interested in the mountains decided upon naming this peak LeConte, in honor of Professor Joseph LeConte. ... A conical mass of rock about 150 feet high and 250 feet in diameter forms the apex of LeConte. After careful investigation we found this utterly impossible to climb. So we placed the monument on the north side of the dome where it can be easily seen by any one approaching the summit; and it a small can we put a photograph of the Professor, with the following memorandum: \"To-day, the 14th of August, 1895, we, undersigned, hereby named this mountain LeConte, in honor of the eminent geologist, Professor Joseph LeConte.\' (A. W. de la Cour Carroll, &lt;i&gt;SCB&lt;/i&gt; 1, no. 8, May 1896: 325-26.) &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Farquhar (&lt;i&gt;Place Names&lt;/i&gt;, 56-57) seems to assume that \'LeConte Divide\' was named for the senior LeConte, but it could just as easily have been for J. N. LeConte, who explored in the Palisades and the Kings River Region. The name appears on the first edition of the Mt. Goddard 30\' map, 1912. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Joseph Nisbet LeConte (1870-1950), a charter member of the Sierra Club, professor of engineering mechanics at the University of California, 1895-1937. The canyon apparently was named by the USGS during the 1907-09 survey for the Mt. Goddard 30\' map; it is on the first edition, 1912. LeConte Point was named by R. B. Marshall, USGS. (Farquhar: Marshall.) &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Joseph N. LeConte was one of the foremost explorers of the Sierra Nevada. He hiked and climbed from 1889 to 1928, wrote extensively about his travels, compiled a number of maps, and was an expert photographer.\" &lt;br&gt;- &lt;b&gt;Peter Browning, &lt;i&gt;Place Names of the Sierra Nevada&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The peak was named for the elder LeConte, Joseph, who had a long friendship with John Muir. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\"Of greater significance in the history of the Sierra Nevada, and more in keeping with John Muir\'s nature, was the arrival in August of the \'University Excursion Party,\' a group of young men from the University of California who had invited their geology professor, Joseph LeConte, to accompany them on a camping trip. While exploring the Valley, they stopped a moment at the foot of the Yosemite Falls, at a sawmill, to make inquires. \'Here we found a man in rough miller\'s garb, whose intelligent face and earnest, clear blue eyes excited our interest. After some conversation, we discovered it was John Muir, a gentleman of whom we had heard so much from Mrs. Professor Carr and others. We urged him to go with us to Mono, and he seemed disposed to do so.\' A few days later Muir joined the party, affording many opportunities for sympathetic discussions about glaciers and rock formations. At Tenaya Lake one evening there took place a tableau of supreme piquancy: \'After supper,\' writes LeConte, \'I went with Mr. Muir and sat on a rock jutting into the lake. It was full moon. I never saw a more delightful scene. The deep stillness of the night; the silvery light and deep shadows of the mountains; the reflection on the water, broken into thousands of glittering points by the ruffled surface; the gentle lapping of the wavelets upon the rocky shore -- all these seemed exquisitely harmonized with one another and the grand harmony made answering music in our hearts. Gradually the lake surface became quiet and mirror-like, and the exquisite surrounding scenery was seen double. For an hour we remained sitting in silent enjoyment of this delicious scene, which we relunctantly left to go to bed.\' They continued to Tuolumne Meadows, made a climb of Mount Dana, and went down Bloody Canyon to Mono Lake and the Craters, where Muir left the party to return to Yosemite. The professor shortly afterwards published several articles in which he expressed views substantially in agreement with those of Muir about glaciation and rock structure. In neither does there appear to have been any thought of rivalry; no doubt each contributed to the development of the other\'s ideas and together they spread a doctrine that gained wider acceptance than the theories so stubornly maintained by the Whitney school.\" &lt;br&gt;- &lt;b&gt;Francis Farquhar, &lt;i&gt;History of the Sierra Nevada&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Joseph maintained an enduring friendship with Muir, and helped found the Sierra Club in 1892. \"Little Joe\", as the younger Joseph N. LeConte was called, was also a charter member, acting as a director from 1898-1940, and as its second president (after Muir) from 1915-1917. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\"Even before the Sierra Club was formally organized, some of its future members were engaged in opening trails into canyons and passes and in climbing peaks. Foremost among them was young Joseph N. LeConte, son of the professor who had accompanied the \'University Excursion Party\' in 1870. \'Little Joe,\' as he was frequently called, while still an undergraduate at the University of California, accompanied his father in 1889 on a camping trip to Hetch Hetchy, Tuolumne Meadows, and the Mariposa Grove of Big Trees, in the course of which he climbed mounts Hoffmann, Dana, and Lyell. Such was the effect of this trip that for the rest of his life the younger LeConte, like his father before him, remained enamoured of the High Sierra. The following year, with three college friends, he visited Kings Canyon, Kearsarge Pass, and Mount Whitney. They returned to Yosemite by way of Owens Valley, Bloody Canyon, and Tuolumne Meadows. On this trip LeConte carried a camera and began a series of photographs which for many years were famous as the finest views of the Sierra published. Year after year he continued to camp in the Sierra and climb the peaks, with various companions but more and more with Miss Helen Marion Gompertz and some of her friends. A climax for the LeConte family was a trip in 1900, when the elder LeConte, then 77 years of age, accompanied the younger people on a camping trip to Kings Canyon. They spent six weeks in the mountains, and he wrote, \'every step of the journey, and in some parts, as we approached the summit, the exhilaration of spirit and the exultation of mind was such as I had not felt for ten years.\' In June, 1901, Helen Gompertz and Joe LeConte were married.

When viewed from the south, the top of the pillar resembles the face of a Monkey complete with a mouth, nose, and eyes.  The pillar is four-sided and bulges on all sides near the top making all routes to the summit quite challenging.  The first summit ascent was made in 1960 by a trio (D. Bohn, J. Fraser, and V Staender) whose names now grace various crags throughout Smith.  The easiest route to the summit is &lt;a href=\"http://www.summitpost.org/show/route_link.pl/route_id/1407/object_id/1695\"&gt;Pioneer Route&lt;/a&gt; rated 5.7 A0 - it overcomes the crux overhung face portion by means of a &lt;a href=\"http://www.summitpost.com/mountains/photo_link.pl/p/photo_id__37233__object_id__1695__type__mountain__mountain_id__1695__route_id____user_id____order_by____limit__\"&gt;bolt ladder&lt;/a&gt;.  Most other (summit) route options in this difficulty range on Monkey are mere variations of Pioneer Route and all funnel through the &lt;a href=\"http://www.summitpost.com/mountains/photo_link.pl/p/photo_id__37233__object_id__1695__type__mountain__mountain_id__1695__route_id____user_id____order_by____limit__\"&gt;bolt ladder&lt;/a&gt; pitch.  Other free summit routes start in the 5.11b range.  The easiest free line to the summit is &lt;a href=\"http://www.summitpost.org/show/route_link.pl/route_id/5067/object_id/1695\"&gt;Monkey Space&lt;/a&gt;, 5.11b.  Monkey Face is also the location of one of the toughest free routes in the world, Just Do It (5.14c) located on the bulging east face, was first climbed in 1992 by Jean-Baptiste Tribout.  If free climbing at the 5.11+ level is not within one\'s ability, an alternative to the &lt;a href=\"http://www.summitpost.org/show/route_link.pl/route_id/1407/object_id/1695\"&gt;Pioneer Route&lt;/a&gt; is the &lt;a href=\"http://www.summitpost.org/show/route_link.pl/route_id/6220/object_id/1695\"&gt;West Face&lt;/a&gt; route (not to be confused with &lt;a href=\"http://www.summitpost.org/show/route_link.pl/route_id/2808/object_id/1695\"&gt;West Face Variation&lt;/a&gt; [to the Pioneer Route]) which can be aided from the ground to the summit in four long pitches via the West Side Cave (see &lt;a href=\"http://www.englishengineering.com/dave/adventures/monkeywest/route.html\"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; for a climb report on this route).  With the exception of the first pitch most of which is done on gear, the other pitches are all bolt ladders (note:  this climb has been rebolted, see &lt;b&gt;Route Updates&lt;/b&gt; section below).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The view from the summit is breathtaking - a beautiful line of the Cascade giants stretches from north to south and includes:  &lt;a href=\"http://www.summitpost.com/mountains/mountain_link.pl/mountain_id/3\"&gt;Mount Hood&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"http://www.summitpost.com/mountains/mountain_link.pl/mountain_id/456\"&gt;Mount Jefferson&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"http://www.summitpost.com/mountains/mountain_link.pl/mountain_id/323\"&gt;Three Fingered Jack&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"http://www.summitpost.com/mountains/mountain_link.pl/mountain_id/450\"&gt;Mount Washington&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"http://www.summitpost.com/mountains/mountain_link.pl/mountain_id/401\"&gt;North Sister&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"http://www.summitpost.com/mountains/mountain_link.pl/mountain_id/309\"&gt;Middle Sister&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"http://www.summitpost.com/mountains/mountain_link.pl/mountain_id/317\"&gt;South Sister&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"http://www.summitpost.com/mountains/mountain_link.pl/mountain_id/454\"&gt;Broken Top&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"http://www.summitpost.com/mountains/mountain_link.pl/mountain_id/334\"&gt;Mount Bachelor&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Note that the present elevation is a \"guesstimate\" - to be corrected once better info. is available.

Those who wish to fly in usually do so via Portland, OR about 3 hours driving time (140 miles) northwest of Terrebonne.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Take US 97 to the town of Terrebonne.  Turn east onto B Avenue which shortly becomes Smith Rock way (there are signs for Smith on US 97).  Follow the road past railroad tracks and down the hill to a signed intersection (approx. 0.75 miles from 97).  Make a left onto NE 1st Ave. which then becomes NE Wilcox Ave.  Follow it for about 1 mile to another signed junction with Crooked River Drive.  Turn left toward Smith.  Follow this road (passing the entrance into Smith Rock campground) until you see a roadside parking area on your left.  Pay the day use fee ($3 per car per day) at the vending machine (or at the self issue station located in the driveway to the campground) and don\'t forget to leave a copy on your dashboard.  The parking area has a public restroom and vending machines.  Stopping at the above-mentioned billboard in the driveway into the state campground (you can pay the day use fee there as well as camping fee if staying overnight at the campground) is generally a good idea since it will allow you to see if there are any pertinent route closures.  Follow the trail down hill toward the bridge over the Crooked River below.  Cross the bridge and you will see a pointer sign - at this point you have several options on how to reach Monkey Face which is essentially on the other side of the huge rock wall looming ahead of you (Picnic Lunch Wall):&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;1.&lt;/b&gt;  &lt;a href=\"http://www.summitpost.com/mountains/photo_link.pl/p/photo_id__39415__object_id__1757__type__mountain__mountain_id__1757__route_id____user_id____order_by____limit__\"&gt;Misery Ridge&lt;/a&gt; Trail (approx. 0.75 mile from bride).  This route is probably the most straight forward approach for north side routes on Monkey (incl. the Pioneer Route).  Past the bridge, follow the trail up switchbacks toward the Picnic Lunch Wall.  The trail turns right at the foot of the wall and skirts its bottom passing along some of the more famous Smith Rock moderates such as Super Slab and Moscow.  Follow the tail as it switchbacks to the top of Misery Ridge.  Atop, the trail levels off.  Stay on main trail and you\'ll soon see the top of Monkey Face on your right (the west side of Misery Ridge).  The rock outcrop closest (across the chasm from) Monkey Face is called The Springboard.  It offers a great vantage point for examining the upper pitches of Monkey and for taking some action photos of climbers.  Additionally, a tyrollean traverse from the Monkey\'s mouth cave can be rigged to the Springboard (heavy duty anchors for this exist on both the Springboard and inside the mouth cave).  After enjoying the view of Monkey from the Springboard, return to the main trail and descend the switchbacked trail toward the Monkey Face pillar.  This is probably the choice approach for the Pioneer route as it not only gives you a great preview of the upper pitches (from Springboard) but also the trail puts you on the correct side of the pillar (see route description).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;2.&lt;/b&gt;  &lt;a href=\"http://www.summitpost.com/mountains/photo_link.pl?photo_id=37273&amp;amp;order_by=&amp;amp;limit=&amp;amp;object_id=1695&amp;amp;type=mountain&amp;amp;mountain_name=Monkey+Face&amp;amp;route_name=&amp;amp;component_title=&amp;amp;mountain_id=1695&amp;amp;route_id=&amp;amp;user_name=&amp;amp;user_id=&amp;amp;option=4&amp;amp;x=24&amp;amp;y=6\"&gt;Asterisk Pass&lt;/a&gt;.  This route offers the quickest approach option to routes located on the south and west sides of Monkey and is (stiff!) 4th class going over the pass - the required downclimb down the west side of the pass can give pause to some people.  After the bridge, make a left and follow the river-side trail past Ship Rock (chossy looking, dark color tower on your right) and the Morning Glory Wall.  When just before and below the Dihedrals on the river trail (you\'re looking for a latrine on your right), take a trail right and uphill toward the crags.  The trail reaches the base of the rock near a vertical wall with huge dissolution pockets (famous bolted routes start here incl. Five Gallon Buckets).  Follow the trail left here as it traverses below the rock face.  Your goal is the pass with what looks like a balanced boulder (it\'s the low point between the Main Smith Group and the Dihedrals visible from the parking lot).  Sky Ridge, a 5.8R Smith Classic starts at the pass.  Go over the pass and descend rightward.  Shortly after you should see the unmistakeable shape of the Monkey Face Pillar.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;3.&lt;/b&gt;  Final option is the longest but the most gentle in terms of elevation gain.  It is about 1.5 miles from the bridge.  Follow directions as for &lt;a href=\"http://www.summitpost.com/mountains/photo_link.pl?photo_id=37273&amp;amp;order_by=&amp;amp;limit=&amp;amp;object_id=1695&amp;amp;type=mountain&amp;amp;mountain_name=Monkey+Face&amp;amp;route_name=&amp;amp;component_title=&amp;amp;mountain_id=1695&amp;amp;route_id=&amp;amp;user_name=&amp;amp;user_id=&amp;amp;option=4&amp;amp;x=24&amp;amp;y=6\"&gt;Asterisk Pass&lt;/a&gt; but instead of turning right and uphill away from the river, stay on the riverside trail as it rounds the large Smith Rock Group on the right.  At some point you will see Monkey Face.&lt;a name=\"chapter_3\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Red Tape&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;div align=\"center\" class=\"image-left\" style=\"width: 206px;\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"/looking-north-from-the-base/87954\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Looking north from the base...\" height=\"150\" width=\"200\" src=\"/images/small/87954.JPG\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=\"caption\"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br&gt;The park charges $3 per vehicle per day to park at the state parking lot.  The park is \"open\" from dawn to dusk (or about 10 pm in the summer).  The consequences of staying past \"closing time\" are unclear and some climbers do \"moonlight climbing\".  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The park allows dogs but is very strict as to keeping them leashed (fine = $96) and requests that you clean up after them.&lt;br&gt;New regulation, as of March 1st, 2003:  Owners of unattended dogs left tied in at the base of climbs will be given a citation.&lt;br&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_4\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;When To Climb&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;div align=\"center\" class=\"image-right\" style=\"width: 156px;\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"/monkey-face/67388\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Monkey Face\" height=\"200\" width=\"150\" src=\"/images/small/67388.JPG\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=\"caption\"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div align=\"center\" class=\"image-left\" style=\"width: 206px;\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"/monkey-face-center-spire-in/131342\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Monkey Face (center) spire in...\" height=\"150\" width=\"200\" src=\"/images/small/131342.JPG\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=\"caption\"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br&gt;The park is officially open year round (though shower facilities at the campground are turned off in winter time).  Climbing can be uncomfortably hot in the summer and snow often blankets the rocks in the winter.  Spring and Fall are ideal as the temperatures are moderate and the east side of Oregon\'s Cascade Mountains is generally dry.  Monkey Face is generally a good choice for warm days as it receives the cooler breezes from the west (coming off of the Cascade mountains).&lt;br&gt;Check with the park (or by calling one of the climbing shops below) for seasonal route closures due to falcon nesting.  You will most likely be ticketed if you break the rules here as the locals often keep an active watch of the crags during closure periods.&lt;a name=\"chapter_5\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Camping&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;div align=\"center\" class=\"image-left\" style=\"width: 156px;\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"/dolf-s-dihedral-direct/281278\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Dolf s Dihedral (Direct)\" height=\"200\" width=\"150\" src=\"/images/small/281278.JPG\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=\"caption\"&gt;Dolf\'s Dihedral (direct start)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br&gt;Smith Rock State Park operates a campground that overlooks the crags (see directions above under Getting There section).  The campground has bathrooms and shower facilities (showers available summertime only) as wells as some communal picnic tables.  Sleeping in cars is not permitted.  The campground charges $4 per person per night (this will also allow you to spend a day enjoying Smith without having to pay the additional $3 day use fee).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In addition, there is a free campground (BLM operated?) approx. 7 miles from the main parking area for Smith.  Directions to this campground:   &lt;a href=\"http://www.smithrock.com/localguide/campgrounds/sh_campground.html\"&gt;Skull Hollow Campground&lt;/a&gt;.  This information was provided by &lt;a href=\"http://www.summitpost.com/mountains/user_link.pl?user_id=349\"&gt;Brian Jenkins&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Want to spend your time at Smith in the lap of luxury?  This is especially nice during late/winter/early season outings when the days are short and nights are long.  The Hub Motel in Redmond offers clean rooms (shower, fridge, cable included!) for $35/night (double occupancy).  This price is most likely a \"special\" for climbers so be sure to smile at the nice folks in the main office and let them know the purpose of your visit.  The motel  (huge red neon sign) is located on the left hand side of US97 on the northern outskirts of Redmond, approximately 6 miles south of Terrebonne.&lt;a name=\"chapter_6\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Mountain Conditions&lt;/h2&gt;Smith Rock is part of the Oregon state park system.  The official (though not very useful for climbers) website is &lt;a href=\"http://www.oregonstateparks.org/park_51.php\"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.  A more useful Smith website is &lt;a href=\"http://www.smithrock.com/\"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://www.goneawol.com/frameset.asp?url=http://www.goclimbing.com/redpoint/index.html\"&gt;Redpoint Climbers Supply&lt;/a&gt; store located on the corner of US 97 and B Avenue (the turnoff to Smith) offers not only a complete selection of climbing paraphenelia but is a great place to inquire about route conditions including details such as bolt conditions and route closures (800-923-6207 or 541-923-6207, hours vary with weather and season).  This is also the place to purchase the guidebook supplement (New Sh!tuff at Smith) mentioned below.&lt;br&gt;Rockhard store is another option for route beta and climbing supplies.  It is located about 100 yards before the campground driveway on Crooked River Drive.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_7\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Guide Books&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;i&gt;A Climber\'s Guide to Smith Rock&lt;/i&gt; by Alan Watts (one of Smith\'s climbing legends) is the main reference for Smith Rock climbing.  The book offers a good selection of both route topos and route photographs including many for Monkey Face routes.  However, given the age of this latest edition (10 years) it does not necessarily contain all of Smith\'s routes and excludes even some of the currently very popular ones (ex. Five Gallon Buckets 5.8).  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A short supplement entitled &lt;i&gt;New Sh!tuff at Smith&lt;/i&gt; by Ryan Lawson containing the latest route editions can be purchased at the Redpoint Climbers Supply store in Terrebonne, Oregon for $5 per copy.  It too however does not necessarily cover all the new routes.  Note that all proceeds from sale of this booklet go to the American Safe Climbing Assoc. for bolt replacements at Smith.  &lt;b&gt;OUT OF PRINT&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_8\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;A Note on Web Links&lt;/h2&gt;I have included a substantial list of web pages offering either route photos or trip reports for Monkey Face (Pioneer Route in particular).  The location of Monkey allows for some excellent \"action\" climbing shots by those lucky enough to have a non-climbing friend take their photos from the Springboard.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_9\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Single Pitch Routes&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;div align=\"center\" class=\"image-left\" style=\"width: 156px;\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"/perpetual-motion/281287\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Perpetual Motion\" height=\"200\" width=\"150\" src=\"/images/small/281287.JPG\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=\"caption\"&gt;Perpetual Motion&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div align=\"center\" class=\"image\" style=\"width: 381px;\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"/monkey-space/282214\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Monkey Space\" height=\"500\" width=\"375\" src=\"/images/medium/282214.JPG\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=\"caption\"&gt;South Face&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Dolf\'s Dihedral (Direct)&lt;/b&gt;:  5.10a, 70 feet.  This line is located on the far south face of Monkey Face complex (well right of West Face Variation start).  Look for a diamond shaped 20-foot flake hanging off the ground.  Direct start follows left side of flake at 10a (very good climbing).  Alternatively, you can start slightly uphill via easy choss and keep things 5.8.  Either way, reach the 25-foot hand crack (stellar but short) and climb to a fixed anchor.  &lt;u&gt;Gear:&lt;/u&gt; single cams from #1 to #5 Camalot (no #4 used).  Extra #2 is nice.  No nuts.  If not doing the \"direct\" start, nothing above #3 is required but a #.5 &amp;amp; #.75 may be nice.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Perpetual Motion&lt;/b&gt;:  5.9, 100 feet.  This line is located on the far south face of Monkey Face complex (well right of West Face Variation start), just to the right/uphill of direct start to Dolf\'s.  Climb low 5th class choss up and left (same start as Dolf\'s regular start).  Move up and right via nice and easy crack/ramp heading for the obvious roof.  Surmount the roof via finger locks behind TV-sized chockstones.  Move up short chimney to an awkward finger crack ending at the anchor (which we provided; no bolts). Careful when lowering off - depending where your belayer is standing, a 60 meter rope barely makes it!  &lt;u&gt;Gear:&lt;/u&gt; single cams from #0.5 to #3 Camalot.  Single Aliens green and yellow.  Extras in #0.5 to #2 Camalots.  Some nuts to back up the anchor if needed.&lt;a name=\"chapter_10\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Food&lt;/h2&gt;Smith Rock Restaurant in Terrebonne (behind a hardware store) is a great choice for after-climbing \"pig-outs\".  The service is outstanding and food very good - both dinners and breakfasts.  Note that it\'s closed Sunday afternoons.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Burger Works in downtown Madras (20 miles north of Terrebonne) is not to be missed for their top-notch marionberry milk shakes.  These are THE best milk shakes we\'ve ever had - PERIOD.  The place is located on the east/south-bound side of US26/97 in Madras.  They also serve decent burgers and very good grilled hot dogs.&lt;br&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_11\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;External Links&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://cascadeclimbers.com/forum/ubbthreads.php/topics/868048/Re_TR_smiffistani_rawks_der_mo#Post868048\"&gt;West Face Aid line TR&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt; Another nice trip report with excellent photos of the route.

It saw its first ascent three years later when E.B. Copeland and E.N. Anderson climbed it via the South Ridge on August 8, 1899. This is a highly worthwhile peak despite (or perhaps because of!) its relatively remote location. In Copeland\'s words, \"the view cannot be rivaled by that from any neighboring mountain, including as it does the basins of the Kings and Kern, with the Inyo Valley, the picture of depth...\"&lt;p&gt;    There are at least six known routes on the peak. It is third class by the easiest route, and a grade III 5.7 technical route has been established on the North Buttress by none other than Fred Beckey. Junction Peak makes for a very long day hike from either Symmes Creek or Onion Valley. Through hikers on the John Muir Trail can bag the summit via a third class scramble from Forester Pass. &lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;table class=\"inline_image_thumbs\"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=17866\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/17866.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=17865\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/17865.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=102817\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/102817.JPG\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=118548\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/118548.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_2\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Getting There&lt;/h2&gt;Ah, getting there. Junction Peak involves a long approach no matter how you go about it. The peak is a short scramble from the John Muir Trail at Forester Pass, but unless you are prepared to spend several days on the JMT getting there, you will probably want to approach from the east.   &lt;p&gt;  The most direct approach is via the Shepard Pass trail. Detailed instructions on reaching the trailhead are to be found on the  &lt;a href=\"http://www.summitpost.org/show/mountain_link.pl/mountain_id/4859\"&gt;Eastern Sierra Logistics&lt;/a&gt; page. After traveling approximately seven miles you will reach The Pothole. If you are interested in the East Couloir or North Buttress routes, then you will want to take the unmaintained trail towards Junction Pass. This is the original John Muir Trail, abandoned in 1932 when the JMT was relocated over Forester Pass. If you are aiming for any of the routes on the south or west, then continue on to Shepard Pass. The Southeast Ridge route starts here. Continue on cross-country to the Diamond Mesa to reach the South Ridge, or stop short of the Mesa and head north to reach the South Face.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;  It is also possible to approach the peak from Onion Valley. There are basically two variants, both of which are longer than the above-described approach, but which have the advantage of passing through some very beautiful country. The first is the shortest, but involves rough cross-country travel. Take the trail to Robinson Lake from Onion Valley, and continue southward over University Pass into Center Basin. From there, either drop down to the JMT and follow it to Forester Pass, or pick up the unmaintained Center Basin trail to Junction Pass. This is a continuation of the same abandoned segment of the JMT described above. The second option is to take the Kearsage Pass trail over the pass until reaching the JMT just west of Bullfrog Lake. Follow the JMT many miles south and east to Forester Pass. &lt;br&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_3\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Routes&lt;/h2&gt;Route descriptions for the following may be found in R.

Which rules apply depends on which direction you approach from. JMT through hikers will already have their permits, so I will only provide detailed information on permits issued by the INF. Junction Peak lies on the border of the John Muir Wilderness within the Inyo National Forest. Wilderness permits are required for overnight camping from May1 through November 1, but not for day hikes. Both the Shepard\'s Pass trail and Kearsarge Pass trails are subject to quotas. In 2005 the limits for non-commercial parties were 15 and 60 entries per day, respectively, with 9 (Shepard\'s Pass) and 36 (Kearsarge) being reservable and the remainder available for walk-in. You can check permit availability on the &lt;a href=\"http://www.fs.fed.us/r5/inyo/recreation/wild/quotas.shtml\"&gt;web&lt;/a&gt;. The info is usually at least close to up-to-date. In 2005 the Kearsarge Pass trail required bear canisters, Shepard\'s Pass did not.  &lt;p&gt;  Permit reservations may be obtained by calling (760) 873-2483, by FAX (call the previous # for the FAX number), or by writing to:  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;  Inyo National Forest&lt;br&gt;351 Pacu Lane &lt;br&gt;Suite 200&lt;br&gt;Bishop, CA 93514  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;  Permits can be picked up in Lone Pine at the Mt. Whitney Ranger Station at:  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;  640 S. Main Street (US 395)&lt;br&gt;P.O. Box 8&lt;br&gt;Lone Pine, CA 93545&lt;br&gt;760-876-6200  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;  or at the White Mountain Ranger Station in Bishop at:  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;  798 North Main Street&lt;br&gt;Bishop, CA 93514&lt;br&gt;760-873-2500&lt;br&gt;760-873-2501 TDD&lt;br&gt;Hours: 8:30 am to 4:30&lt;br&gt;Open all year&lt;br&gt;Monday-Friday in winter  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;  The usual backcountry rules apply: camp at least 100 feet from water, pack out your trash, no wood fires, etc.  The east side of the peak lies in the California Bighorn Sheep Zoological Area, which means that you can\'t bring your dog or pet sheep with you. No other special restrictions were in effect as of summer 2005.&lt;br&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_5\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;When To Climb&lt;/h2&gt;The mountain can be and is climbed at all times of the year. While there is nothing to match the solitude, quiet, and incomparable beauty of the winter, avalanches are a reality. Be prepared for difficult conditions and to assess avalanche potential if you head up in the winter.   &lt;p&gt;  There are many resources available to find out current conditions in the area:  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;  Staff at the Mt. Whitney Ranger Station can provide &lt;a href=\"http://www.fs.fed.us/r5/inyo/conditions/index.shtml\"&gt;current conditions&lt;/a&gt; during the summer months (though they may be a bit on the conservative side if asked about the need for foul weather gear, crampons, etc.) Information on current conditions can also be found on the web:  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;  &lt;a href=\"http://www.srh.noaa.gov/data/forecasts/CAZ026.php?warncounty=CAC027&amp;amp;city=Lone+Pine%22\"&gt;Lone Pine weather&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://cdec.water.ca.gov/snow/current/snow/\"&gt;Snowpack conditions&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://www.csac.org/Bulletins/Calif/esierra.php\"&gt;Avalanche Hazard (winter only)&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;  You might also want to check the message boards at:  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;  &lt;a href=\"http://www.whitneyportalstore.com/\"&gt;Whitney Portal Store&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://www.mt-whitney.info/\"&gt;Mt.

If you are approaching via the Shepard Pass trail, Anvil Camp (~10,000\') is a common place to stop for the night.&lt;br&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_7\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Images&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div align=\"center\"&gt;&lt;table id=\"my_images\"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/junction-peak/210662/c-151509\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Junction Peak\" src=\"/images/square/210662.JPG\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/the-tallest-pinnacle-along/120891/c-151509\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"The tallest pinnacle along...\" src=\"/images/square/120891.JPG\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/university-peak-from-mt-gould-south-slope/783961/c-151509\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"University Peak from Mt.

They tend to be tall and more rugged. Don\'t mistake them for the classic though. The iconic state monument summit Diamond Head in Wakiki, Hawaii is the by far the most famous of them all. It is also the most visited and the most well know as well. No visitor can go to Hawaii without seeing Diamond Head towering over the beaches of Wakiki and many tourist, many who are not hikers our peakbaggers hike to the summit of this famous clasic summit. Honestly a trip to Hawaii would not be complete without a hike up Diamond Head. Even many none hikers would agree with that observation.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div style=\"width: 606px;\" class=\"image\" align=\"center\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=85704\"&gt;&lt;img style=\"width: 600px; height: 450px;\" alt=\"A view of Honolulu from the...\" src=\"/images/medium/85704.JPG\" unselectable=\"on\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=\"caption\"&gt;Looking at Wakiki and Honolulu&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Located on the island of Oahu, Diamond Head is one of the most recognizable peaks in Hawaii.  This a classic summit to all that visit Wakiki and millions recognize this summit at first glance. On any day of the year hundreds of people head to the summit of this extinct volcano. Overlooking Waikiki, it\'s drama makes for picturesque views.  The \'peak\' is now only the highest point of an extinct volcano that blew it\'s top thousands of years ago.  The ancient Hawaiians called Diamond Head, \"Le\' Ahi\", meaning \"brow\" or \"back\" since it looks like the dorsal fin of the Tuna.  The common name of Diamond Head came from U.S. and British sailors mistaking the calcate crystals for diamonds. The station on the top was originally built in 1911 as a fire control station.  Before World War II, the U.S. converted it over by digging out lookout bunkers due to a threat of a Japanese potential invasion. They liked this site because of the expansive view from Aiea and Hawaii Kai all the way to Pearl Harbor.  On a clear day, you can see Maui and even Molokai.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div style=\"width: 606px;\" class=\"image\" align=\"center\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=98871\"&gt;&lt;img style=\"width: 600px; height: 337.5px;\" alt=\"Picture of the many bunkers...\" src=\"/images/medium/98871.jpg\" unselectable=\"on\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=\"caption\"&gt;Picture of the many bunkers...&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_2\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The Route&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div style=\"width: 606px;\" class=\"image\" align=\"center\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=224365\"&gt;&lt;img style=\"width: 600px; height: 450px;\" alt=\"Circular Stairwell\" src=\"/images/medium/224365.JPG\" unselectable=\"on\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=\"caption\"&gt;Circular Stairwell&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;The trail to the peak is often crowded because of its ease and distance from downtown Waikiki.  It\'s a great trek for the whole family.  The trail is about 0.8 mile long and can be done in just tennis shoes (if it\'s not wet).  It\'s recommended to carry a flashlight to negotiate a tunnel walkway and a REALLY dark winding staircase.  The majority of the trail is a natural pathway carved out by foot traffic.  As you near the top, you begin making your way through the bunkers, but that\'s not before you hit the stairs.  100 of them to be exact!  I didn\'t count them, but they\'re numbered in increments of 10.   Oh yeah, that\'s after the first set of stairs of 60-70 stairs...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div style=\"width: 606px;\" class=\"image\" align=\"center\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=41366\"&gt;&lt;img style=\"width: 600px; height: 436.5px;\" alt=\"The winding trail at Diamond...\" src=\"/images/medium/41366.jpg\" unselectable=\"on\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=\"caption\"&gt;The winding trail at Diamond...&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_3\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Getting There&lt;/h2&gt;Heading East on highway I-H1, take the Koko Head Ave exit (Exit #26A).  Turn right on Koko Head Ave and then left on Pahoa Ave, about a half mile down.  Turn right at the four-way stop on 18th Ave.  At the end of 18th Ave, make a quick right and a quick left (you will see the sign for Diamond Head) will take you to the Diamond Head Crater National Park.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If you don\'t have a car, the #58 or #22 bus should get you there, too.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Once you are in the parking lot, the trailhead starts on the left of the restrooms at the far end of the lot.&lt;br&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_4\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Red Tape&lt;/h2&gt;There isn\'t a fee to actually hike the trail, but there is a $5.00 parking fee. There is also a $1 fee per pedestrian. It should be noted that it &lt;b&gt;cash only&lt;/b&gt;.  Also, the park is only open from 6 am to 6 pm.  If you park, BE SURE TO BE OUT BY 6 PM, or your car will be stuck since they close the gate to the only entrance to the parking lot.  I also heard that they either start towing cars in the lot at 7 pm or that you\'d have to pay another day\'s parking the next day when you pick up your car.  Either way, I didn\'t want to find out.&lt;br&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_5\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;When To Climb&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is a year round hike.

The lime stone monolith block that constitutes Notch Peak is one of the highest points in the House Range complex, and the enormous west face of Notch Peak has been called \"the desert equivalent of Yosemite&rsquo;s El Capitan\"; its rise of nearly 4,450 feet makes it one of the highest cliffs in North America.  The north face has an uninterrupted vertical rise of over 2,000 feet.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The House Range complex is located in Utah\'s west desert in the Great Basin. Along the ridgline of the range there is a massive limestone cliff that winds its way along the entire length of each of the three sections of the complex, often reaching uninterrupted heights of over 1,000 feet. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;While much of the House Range is dominated by pinon-juniper or sagebrush-shadscale communities, impressive stands of large aspen and conifers grow at higher elevations. The highest ridges and peaks support a healthy population of ancient bristlecone pine. Sagebrush, shadscale, Mormon tea, and various annual and perennial grasses cover the undulating western slopes.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;While mining exploration historically took place at the base of these slopes, the predominant current use appears to be sheep grazing in the winter. Camping, hunting, rockhounding, and hiking also occur. The western alluvial fans offer tremendous views of the spectacular lime stone escarpment on Notch Peak itself. And views from Notch Peak and Bald Mountain offer unparalleled panoramas of valleys and mountains for a hundred miles in any direction. One can even see the Bonneville Salt Flats 120 miles to the north.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Notch Peak area has outstanding opportunities for solitude when considered as an extension of the Notch Peak Wilderness Study Area (WSA).The open brush- and tree-covered western benches of the House Range have a subtle but complex topography that offers solitude. Tall stands of trees and the narrow, deep canyon bottom offer outstanding opportunities for solitude. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Besides solitude, the range has exraordinary opportunities for rock climbing, spelunking.  It is also contains extremely interesting geological formations resulting from the limestone, granite, quartzite, etc.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Note: Much of this initial descriptive information is being quoted from the BLM\'s &lt;a href=\"http://w3.access.gpo.gov/blm/utah/pdf/wc14.pdf\"&gt;report&lt;/a&gt; of the area.   &lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;table class=\"inline_image_thumbs\"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=19432\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/19432.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=19429\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/19429.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=19436\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/19436.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=131865\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/131865.JPG\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=138554\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/138554.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_2\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Getting There&lt;/h2&gt;The peak is located 120 miles south west of Provo, Utah, so it is a bit of a drive to get there.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;East Side - Sawtooth Canyon Approach:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;From Delta, Utah, take Highway 6 (aka Highway 50) west 40 miles.  From here you turn north (right) on to The Notch Peak Loop Road (unpaved) just before the road rounds the southern tip of the range, just before mileage marker 46.  Drive 4 miles north to the signed Miller Canyon Road, and then turn left. Drive another 5 miles to a sign that points left to Sawtooth Canyon. A short ways later you will encounter a log cabin on the north side of the road and a stone road block. Continue on up the canyon dirt road by foot from here, and it eventually turns into a trail.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;West Side - North Face Approach:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Same as east side, but take the first dirt road on the right after rounding the pass. Look at the maps on the site for further directions. &lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;table class=\"inline_image_thumbs\"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=19427\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/19427.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=19434\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/19434.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=19452\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/19452.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=19454\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/19454.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=30649\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/30649.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_3\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Climbing Notch Peak&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;br&gt;Some Highlights:&lt;br&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Swiss Route (North Face)&lt;/b&gt; - V 5.10+ A2 (18 pitches) - climbed by Thomas Koch and Peter Deinen in 1986.

No permits or fees are needed to climb the peak or camp in the range. Take care as to the selection of a campsite , since there are no campgrounds in the WSA.&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;table class=\"inline_image_thumbs\"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=19438\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/19438.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_5\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;When To Climb&lt;/h2&gt;Spring and Fall are the best times to climb due to the lack of snow and cooler temperatures.  I haven\'t climbed in the other seasons, but I\'d expect the main difficulties in the winter to be light or sporadic snow cover.  In the summer the air temperature often exceeds 100 degrees farenheit, and there isn\'t much shade.   During the spring there are a number of springs that are good for drinking water.  Except for these springs, there are NO OTHER SOURCES OF WATER, so bring plenty of it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_6\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;External Links&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://www.hempweaver.com/NotchPeak.html\"&gt;Hempweaver.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt; Provides some more general info about the area, routes, and lots of good photos&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://dave.crockett.net/notch.htm\"&gt;The House Range, Millard County, Utah, by Jim Drysdale&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://w3.access.gpo.gov/blm/utah/pdf/wc14.pdf\"&gt;BLM Document&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt; Provides some more general info about the House Range and discusses its Wilderness Area Eligibility&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://www.suwa.org/WATE/houserange.html\"&gt;SUWA&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt; Good general description of the House Range and Notch Peak&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://www.desertratsanonymous.com/Climbing/Notch_Peak/Notch_peak_index.html\"&gt;Notch Peak Ascent on DesertRatsAnonymous&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt; Slideshow and account from a summer 2005 ascent of Book of Saturday\'s on Notch peak.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://www.desertratsanonymous.com/Climbing/Notch_Peak/Notch_peak_index.html\"&gt;A TR of an ascent of Book of Saturday (V 5.11a) on the north face. - by Brent Higgins&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://www2.standard.net/standard/57265/#\"&gt;Standard Examiner article on an ascent of Book of Saturday by Bryce Peterson Jr.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;iframe src=\"http://player.vimeo.com/video/15699398\" width=\"400\" height=\"225\" frameborder=\"0\"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://vimeo.com/15699398\"&gt;Notch Peak South Wall&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"http://vimeo.com/user879196\"&gt;Marshall Miller&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=\"http://vimeo.com\"&gt;Vimeo&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;                     &lt;div align=\"center\"&gt;&lt;a name=\"messages\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_7\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Additions and Corrections&lt;/h2&gt;[ &lt;a href=\"/object_discussion.php?type=vote_comments&amp;amp;object_id=151567&amp;amp;is_addition=1#vote_form\"&gt;Post an Addition or Correction&lt;/a&gt; ]&lt;table cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" style=\"width: 775px;\"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;table cellpadding=\"2\" cellspacing=\"2\" width=\"100%\"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;&lt;span class=\"pagertext\"&gt;Viewing: &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;-&lt;b&gt;8&lt;/b&gt; of &lt;b&gt;8&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td align=\"center\"&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td align=\"right\"&gt;    &lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;table border=\"0\" width=\"775\" class=\"messages\"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td width=\"110\" align=\"left\" valign=\"top\" style=\"padding-top: 6px;\"&gt;&lt;a name=\"107583\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a class=\"dis_user_lnk\" href=\"/users/scott/16365\"&gt;Scott&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td valign=\"top\" style=\"padding-top: 6px;\"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Untitled Comment&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td align=\"right\" valign=\"top\" nowrap style=\"font-size: 10px;\"&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td valign=\"top\" rowspan=\"2\" align=\"left\" style=\"padding-top: 6px;\"&gt;&lt;p class=\"disc_avatar\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"/users/scott/16365\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Scott\" width=\"50\" height=\"50\" border=\"0\" src=\"/images/avatars/142800.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=\"font-size: 9px; color: #888;\"&gt;Voted 10/10&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td colspan=\"2\" style=\"padding-top: 6px;\"&gt;That is an very interesting TR you have.

The 2006 Wilderness closures keep one from driving all the way in, but it is still possible to camp at 6850\'.

The north route is totally trailless and has a very nasty dryfall, and an almost-as nasty cliff band on the way (at least they seemed nasty on the downclimb).

The first one is quite nice, the 2nd one is worse and is 5.1 miles from the turnoff (The sign is eroding but still visible), the 3rd dirt road has a sign pointing to \"notch peak trailhead\".  From here it was 3.2 miles on a pretty crappy dirt road.  We made it in my low clearance car but hit a few nasty rocks and were definitely concerned about worse damage and flat tires.  Once you get there, the road dead ends and there is a sign signifying \"Notch Peak Trailhead\".  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;-The trail (South route signed by several cairns about .7 miles from the start) is in good condition, a bit overgrown but easy to follow.  Once you get out of the wash, there is about 1/2 to 3/4 of a mile of cairn following that is tough.  Once you get to the cliff overlook, it is easy to find the way up left to the top.  &lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td valign=\"bottom\" style=\"padding-top: 6px;\" colspan=\"2\"&gt;&lt;span style=\"font-size: 9px; color: #888;\"&gt;Posted Jun 9, 2013 9:51 pm&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;table border=\"0\" width=\"775\" class=\"messages\"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td width=\"110\" align=\"left\" valign=\"top\" style=\"padding-top: 6px;\"&gt;&lt;a name=\"486732\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a class=\"dis_user_lnk\" href=\"/users/sabineinutah/123221\"&gt;SabineInUtah&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td valign=\"top\" style=\"padding-top: 6px;\"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Distance&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td align=\"right\" valign=\"top\" nowrap style=\"font-size: 10px;\"&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td valign=\"top\" rowspan=\"2\" align=\"left\" style=\"padding-top: 6px;\"&gt;&lt;p class=\"disc_avatar\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"/users/sabineinutah/123221\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"SabineInUtah\" width=\"50\" height=\"50\" border=\"0\" src=\"/images/avatars/950510.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=\"font-size: 9px; color: #888;\"&gt;Hasn\'t voted&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td colspan=\"2\" style=\"padding-top: 6px;\"&gt;I haven\'t found information on the hiking distance from the TH via Sawtooth Canyon to the summit, but estimate it to be about 6 miles.

Of all the alpine ice climbs in the area, Gilbert\'s North Couloir and Thompson\'s Moynier Couloir are considered the best. Thompson\'s summit plateau is a broad flat area with the actual summit being a 20\' high class 3 boulder pile.  &lt;p&gt;  For ice climbers, all the couloirs are easily accessible from the South Lake trailhead (9,820\') used for Bishop Pass. Downclimbing the Harrington Couloir seems to be the fastest way down for these. Although the Thompson Ridge is rated at class 3, it is a fairly long hike out. Attempting to descend the Thompson Ridge faster has led to rappel epics in the past. The Smrz Couloir is named after SP\'s own &lt;a href=\"http://www.summitpost.com/mountains/user_link.pl/user_id/4920\"&gt;Alois Smrz&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;  Peakbaggers and ski mountaineers have combined trips to Mount Thompson with Point Powell or Mount Powell (different peaks). Starting from the trailhead at Lake Sabrina (9,080\') one heads south towards Sunset Lake (11,464\'). Climb up to the Thompson-Powell col and ascend the class 2 SW Face or class 3 West Ridge.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;  The high point of the Thompson Ridge is also known as \"Ski Mountaineers Peak\" after the Sierra Club\'s Ski Mountaineers Section. Those that disapprove of the Ski Mountaineers Section, usually for petty differences, refer to the summit as \"Motocross Peak.\"&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;table class=\"inline_image_thumbs\"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=19702\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/19702.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=142410\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/142410.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_2\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Routes Overview &amp;amp;

 &lt;/ul&gt;  &lt;br&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_3\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Getting There&lt;/h2&gt;LAKE SABRINA: Take CA SR 168 (aka West Line Street) west from Bishop. Take this road through the village of Aspendell and continue heading south until you arrive at Lake Sabrina.Take the trail south for Blue, Baboon, Moonlight, and Sunset Lakes.  &lt;p&gt;  SOUTH LAKE: From Bishop, also take CA SR 168, however look for the turn off for South Lake. The road will end at the trailhead. From here take the trail south towards Trasure Lakes departing the trail and heading west over Gilbert\'s NE Ridge and into the Gilbert-Thompson basin from where you can climb any of the 5 alpine ice couloirs on the two peaks.&lt;br&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_4\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Red Tape&lt;/h2&gt;The north side of Mount Thompson is in the John Muir Wilderness (Inyo NF) and the south side is in Kings Canyon NP. Approaches from Lake Sabrina and South Lake travel through the John Muir Wilderness.  &lt;p&gt;  WILDERNESS PERMIT (MANDATORY for overnight trips in JMW): A free wilderness permit is required if you are going to spend the night in the John Muir Wilderness. Furthermore, there is a permit quota from May 1 to November 1. From Nov 2 to April 30, a self-issued permit is available at Inyo NF Ranger Stations and Visitor Centers. During the quota period 60% of permits are available for reservation ($5 fee) with the balancing being available for walk-ins starting at 11am the prior day.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;  BEAR CANISTERS (Ref: &lt;a href=\"http://www.summitpost.com/mountains/user_link.pl?user_id=709\"&gt;steeleman&lt;/a&gt;): \"Bear canisters were not mandatory for our trip up the sabrina basin in June 2003. We camped at Sunset Lake. I was told that they were recommended, but not required. However, I was told that if I did not have a cannister, I had to counterbalance my food. Easier said than done, since Sunset Lake has no trees :-)\"  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;  For more information on the red tape, contact the Inyo NF:  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;  Inyo National Forest&lt;br&gt;873 North Main Street&lt;br&gt;Bishop, CA 93514  &lt;p&gt;  TEL: 760.873.2400&lt;br&gt;TTY: 760.873.2538&lt;br&gt;WEB: &lt;a href=\"http://www.fs.fed.us/r5/inyo/\"&gt;http://www.fs.fed.us/r5/inyo/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;table class=\"inline_image_thumbs\"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=142415\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/142415.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=142416\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/142416.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_5\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;When To Climb&lt;/h2&gt;The best times to climb Mount Thompson are from late May to early October. Early season brings more skiers to Thompson and Powell while ice climbers start making visits to Gilbert and Thompson in late July.&lt;br&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_6\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Camping&lt;/h2&gt;There are numerous backcountry places to camp on both Lake Sabrina and South Lake approaches. When arriving from Lake Sabrina, it is popular to camp at Sunset Lake (11,464\') about 0.7 miles NNE of Mount Thompson\'s summit and just west of the Thompson Ridge.

This is the large jagged mountain clearly visible from the Bear Lake area. It is also easy to distinguish from downtown Estes Park. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If you are looking for solitude, this may not be the best mountain. It is heavily traveled, and is one of the most visited mountains in the National Park. However, I have started before sunrise, on a couple of occasions, and missed the large crowds until the hike back down. Weekday, obviously, are much less crowded. In my opinion, the best time to hike Hallett Peak would be early on a weekday morning.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This is a pretty easy hike. You will do nothing more than walk, and will not need to use you hands for anything more than eating, drinking, or taking the all important pictures of this beautiful hike. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Round Trip: 10 miles&lt;br&gt;Elevation gain: 3,238 feet&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;table class=\"inline_image_thumbs\"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=19799\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/19799.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=80031\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/80031.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=19801\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/19801.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=82924\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/82924.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=128578\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/128578.JPG\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_2\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Getting There&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;br&gt;You will want to start your hike from Bear Lake, in Rocky Mountain National Park. The easiest way to get to Bear Lake, will be to enter the Park at the Beaver Meadows Entrance (hwy 36). Take your first left onto Bear Lake Road, and follow it until it dead ends (about 10 miles) at the Bear Lake Parking Lot. Follow the path about 1/4th of the way around the lake until you see the trail with sign directing you to Flattop Mountain. Follow that trail.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://www.nps.gov/romo/visit/maps.html\"&gt; Maps&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;table class=\"inline_image_thumbs\"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=30453\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/30453.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=44901\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/44901.JPG\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=38960\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/38960.JPG\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=38963\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/38963.JPG\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=39010\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/39010.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_3\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Red Tape&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;br&gt;The only permit required is a pass to get into the National Park. You can buy a week pass for $15, or an annual pass for $30. If you plan on camping , you will need to contact the Backcountry Office at 970-586-1242. Fees for camping vary, depending on the season, and the number in your party. A parking pass will only be required when parking overnight. A pass is included in the price of you backcountry camping permit.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://www.nps.gov/romo/visit/fees.html\"&gt; Fees for admission.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://www.nps.gov/romo/visit/park/protecting.html\"&gt; Basic Rules/Regulations&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;table class=\"inline_image_thumbs\"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=72698\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/72698.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=61301\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/61301.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=61298\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/61298.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_4\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;When To Climb&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;br&gt;Hallett Peak can be climbed any time of the year. However, the Flattop Mountain Trail is basically snow free from June through September. So the Summer and early Fall are the easiest times to climb this mountain. It is just a little harder in the Winter, simply because it\'s more work using snowshoes. You will not need crampons or an ice axe.&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;table class=\"inline_image_thumbs\"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=67159\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/67159.JPG\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=72699\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/72699.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_5\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Camping&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;br&gt;Camping is allowed in the National Park. There are a few campsites in the area, some closer to Hallet Peak than others. There are no campsites on the Flattop Mountain Trail. Ask about campsites around Fern Lake and/or sites just West of Hallett in the Tonohutu drainage, or the North Inlet drainage. Call 970-586-1242 to make reservations. Fees will vary depending on season and the number in your party.

It is an impressive and prominent mountain.  This mountain is one of the few in the West Desert with a nice system of hiking trails.  It is clearly visible for many miles around, particularly from across the Great Salt Lake to the north and the desert valleys to the west.  It has large cliffs that drop precipitously down toward South Willow Canyon.  While the Wasatch Range may be crowded with hikers on the weekends, you can expect more solitude here.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This area has rugged terrain and high peaks.  North Willow Peak and South Willow Peak are located on the ridge to the north of Deseret Peak.  Much of the higher elevation is alpine with open basins and exposed rocky ridges. Vegetation includes dense mountain brush mixed with sagebrush and grass, various firs, juniper, and aspen.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Deseret Peak Wilderness is located in western Utah, near the cities of Tooele and Grantsville. The Wilderness was established by Congress in 1984 with passage of the Utah Wilderness Act. It is entirely located within the Stansbury Range on the Wasatch-Cache National Forest.  The Deseret Peak Wilderness consists of approximately 25,500 acres and is generally bounded on the north by the Pass Canyon drainage, on the south by Vickory Mountain, on the west by Skull Valley and on the east by the Mack Canyon-Big Hollow Trail.  The highpoint of the Northern Stansbury Mountains is Onaqui BM.  This shouldn\'t be confused with the Onaqui Mountains which form the southern section of the Stansbury Mountains.  The highpoint in that area is Stookey Peak.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Deseret Peak is the highpoint of Tooele County.  It is hiked often each year by people wanting to complete all of the county highpoints in Utah.  The name of the county is often mispronounced.  The most common pronunciation is either Two-ella or Tu-will-uh.  It certainly doesn\'t sound the way it is spelled.  Another interesting fact is that Deseret Peak is one of the 57 mountains in the lower 48 states that have over 5,000 feet of prominence.  These peaks are often called an \"Ultra\" by those pursuing such lists.  Deseret Peak has over 5,800 feet of prominence making it the 4th most prominent peak in Utah.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_2\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Getting There&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;div align=\"center\" class=\"image-left\" style=\"width: 206px;\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"/cold-wind-to-valhalla/742440\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Cold Wind to Valhalla ..\" height=\"152\" width=\"200\" src=\"/images/small/742440.JPG\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=\"caption\"&gt;Deseret Peak&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div align=\"center\" class=\"image-right\" style=\"width: 206px;\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"/deseret-peak-view/602665\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Deseret Peak View\" height=\"150\" width=\"200\" src=\"/images/small/602665.JPG\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=\"caption\"&gt;Deseret Peak&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br&gt;From Salt Lake City, drive to Interstate-80 West.  Follow I-80 and then take (exit 99) named for Tooele/Stansbury.  Now drive south on Highway 36/SR 138. Drive 3.5 miles and turn right on State Road 138. Follow this road for 11 miles to the city of Grantsville. Turn left on West Street at the end of town.  This road will become Mormon Trail Road. Drive 5 miles south from Grantsville to a sign for South Willow Canyon. Turn right and follow this road which becomes gravel near the national forest boundary.  Go to the end of the road at the Loop Campground and trailhead. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_3\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Route Information&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;br&gt;There are two main routes that people use to reach the summit.  The standard route is up South Willow Creek.  A lot of hikers return down the same way.  The best way to experience the whole mountain is to do a loop hike and descend down the Pockets Fork-Dry Lake Fork trail.  This option is only slightly longer in distance.  There are also other routes including the Twin Couloirs.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;noformat&gt;&lt;table border=\"0\" cellspacing=\"1\" bgcolor=\"white\"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt; &lt;div align=\"center\" class=\"image-left\" style=\"width: 206px;\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"/deseret/210941\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Deseret\" height=\"150\" width=\"200\" src=\"/images/small/210941.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=\"caption\"&gt;Deseret Trail&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt; &lt;div align=\"center\" class=\"image-left\" style=\"width: 206px;\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"/deseret/210942\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Deseret\" height=\"150\" width=\"200\" src=\"/images/small/210942.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=\"caption\"&gt;The Saddle&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt; &lt;div align=\"center\" class=\"image-left\" style=\"width: 206px;\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"/deseret/210944\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Deseret\" height=\"150\" width=\"200\" src=\"/images/small/210944.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=\"caption\"&gt;Mill Fork View&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/noformat&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://www.summitpost.org/route/157990/south-willow-creek-route.html\"&gt;&lt;b&gt;South Willow Creek&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt; - (Class 1)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The trail climbs through an aspen forest for about three-fourths of a mile before crossing a stream.  Then it, shortly thereafter, reaches a fork. The right fork leads to Willow Lakes.  The left fork heads south towards the peak.  This is the route you will want to take.  In the next mile and a half, the trail climbs up Mill Fork for almost 2,000 feet, crossing several meadows with the southwest face of Deseret Peak appearing above.  You\'ll reach a saddle at the head of the canyon.  The trail goes up switchbacks on the final ascent to the ridge and then to the summit.  There are spectacular views of the surrounding salt flats, nearby mountains, and Wasatch Mountains.  You can take the same route back down or descend the Pockets Fork trail.  To complete the loop, hike north of Deseret Peak for about two miles to where the trail forks.  Take the south fork back instead of the one to Willow Lake.  The route is 8 miles round trip with 3,600 feet elevation gain.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;noformat&gt;&lt;table border=\"0\" cellspacing=\"1\" bgcolor=\"white\"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt; &lt;div align=\"center\" class=\"image-left\" style=\"width: 206px;\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"/summit-view-looking-northeast/218505\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Summit View Looking Northeast\" height=\"150\" width=\"200\" src=\"/images/small/218505.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=\"caption\"&gt;Deseret View&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt; &lt;div align=\"center\" class=\"image-left\" style=\"width: 206px;\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"/deseret-peak-from-north-ridge-trail/746699\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Deseret Peak from north ridge trail\" height=\"150\" width=\"200\" src=\"/images/small/746699.JPG\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=\"caption\"&gt;North Ridge&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt; &lt;div align=\"center\" class=\"image-left\" style=\"width: 206px;\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"/north-ridge-of-deseret-peak/99339\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"North ridge of Deseret Peak....\" height=\"150\" width=\"200\" src=\"/images/small/99339.JPG\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=\"caption\"&gt;North Ridge&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/noformat&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://www.summitpost.org/route/161192/descent-via-pocketts-fork-dry-lake-fork.html\"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Pockets Fork - Dry Lake Fork&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt; - (Class 1)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This is often used as a descent route for Deseret Peak and can also be used as an ascent route.  It goes along the north ridge of the peak and then heads east. It is an easy hike for a mile or so and then begins a steep descent down a glacial headwall. The route continues north along the ridge for two miles.  You will pass two saddles that give you excellent views into Dry Lake Basin.  It is tempting to use some of these saddles to descend gullies into the basin but they are steep and full of loose talus.  Pockets Peak, 10,129 feet, is a nice bonus peak that you can add to your hike which is located south of Pockets Fork Saddle.  The trail will start heading east, crosses a pass, and then descends for 0.5 mile when you will reach another trail junction. Turn right and this route will take you back to the trailhead.  The loop up South Willow Creek and down the Pockets Fork trail is about 8.4 miles round trip.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;noformat&gt;&lt;table border=\"0\" cellspacing=\"1\" bgcolor=\"white\"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt; &lt;div align=\"center\" class=\"image-left\" style=\"width: 156px;\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"/skinning-the-apron-of-the-twin-couloirs/627223\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Skinning the Apron of the Twin Couloirs\" height=\"200\" width=\"150\" src=\"/images/small/627223.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=\"caption\"&gt;Twin Couloirs&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt; &lt;div align=\"center\" class=\"image-left\" style=\"width: 206px;\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"/the-twin-couloirs/736963\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"The Twin  Couloirs\" height=\"150\" width=\"200\" src=\"/images/small/736963.JPG\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=\"caption\"&gt;Twin Couloirs&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt; &lt;div align=\"center\" class=\"image-left\" style=\"width: 156px;\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"/skiing-the-twin-couloirs/627228\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Skiing the Twin Couloirs\" height=\"200\" width=\"150\" src=\"/images/small/627228.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=\"caption\"&gt;Twin Couloirs&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/noformat&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://www.summitpost.org/route/627220/twin-couloirs.html\"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Twin Couloirs&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt; - (Snow Route / Ski Class 3)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Twin Couloirs are for people looking for a something more challenging and different than the standard routes up Deseret Peak.  The couloirs are located southeast of the summit of Deseret Peak.  They face toward the north and are easily identified.  A long rock rib separates the two couloirs which are not far from each other.  They are referred to as West Twin Couloir and East Twin Couloir and may contain snow from winter through early summer.  These couloirs offer over 1,000 feet of climbing and they are often skied.  After the snow melts the couloirs hold steep talus and scree.

They are commonly referred to as North Willow Peak and South Willow Peak.  North Willow is Peak 10,521 and South Willow is Peak 10,685.  These two peaks may also be referred to as North Medina Peak and South Medina Peak, a name that was mentioned by the Wasatch Mountain Club.  You can combine them with a day hike of Deseret Peak from the Pockets Fork route.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_4\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Red Tape&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;div align=\"center\" class=\"image-left\" style=\"width: 206px;\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"/deseret-peak-and-unnamed-mountain/314643\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Deseret Peak and unnamed mountain\" height=\"150\" width=\"200\" src=\"/images/small/314643.JPG\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=\"caption\"&gt;Deseret Peak&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div align=\"center\" class=\"image-right\" style=\"width: 206px;\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"/cornice-on-deseret-looks-like-dessert/620022\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Cornice on Deseret, looks like dessert\" height=\"134\" width=\"200\" src=\"/images/small/620022.JPG\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=\"caption\"&gt;Cornices&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br&gt;Deseret Peak is located in &lt;a href=\"http://www.fs.fed.us/r4/uwc/\"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Wasatch-Cache National Forest&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There are no fees for climbing Deseret Peak.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;All Wilderness Area rules should be observed.  There is a fee for staying overnight at the established campgrounds.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This area has been successfully restored to pristine wilderness from former mining days, so it isn\'t a good idea to cut switchbacks or engage in any other activity that would encourage erosion.  There are plenty of mule deer and other wildlife in the area so try to exercise caution during hunting season in autumn.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_5\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Weather&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;div align=\"center\" class=\"image-left\" style=\"width: 206px;\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"/stansbury-at-80-mph/476008\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Stansbury at 80 MPH\" height=\"150\" width=\"200\" src=\"/images/small/476008.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=\"caption\"&gt;Stansbury Mountains&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div align=\"center\" class=\"image-right\" style=\"width: 206px;\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"/twin-chutes-saddle-4-11-06/188514\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Twin Chutes Saddle, 4/11/06\" height=\"150\" width=\"200\" src=\"/images/small/188514.JPG\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=\"caption\"&gt;Weather on the Ridge&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br&gt;The summer months are the normal time to visit these mountains.  Even though it is located in a desert region, this is a high elevation mountain range.  In summer temperatures can range from near 80 degrees in the daytime to below 40 degrees at night. Occasional summer thundershowers can be expected.  In winter, temperatures will be around 30-40 degrees but may be much colder in the mountains.  Be prepared for changing weather conditions in the higher elevations.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Here is the weather forecast for the city of &lt;a href=\"http://www.wunderground.com/US/UT/Tooele.html\"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Tooele&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"http://forecast.weather.gov/MapClick.php?lat=40.45987873062575&amp;amp;lon=-112.62660026550293&amp;amp;site=slc&amp;amp;smap=1&amp;amp;unit=0&amp;amp;lg=en&amp;amp;FcstType=text\"&gt;&lt;b&gt;NWS&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This is a forecast for the city of &lt;a href=\"http://www.wunderground.com/US/UT/Grantsville.html\"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Grantsville&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_6\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;When To Climb&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;div align=\"center\" class=\"image-left\" style=\"width: 156px;\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"/deseret-peak/285329\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Deseret Peak\" height=\"200\" width=\"150\" src=\"/images/small/285329.JPG\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=\"caption\"&gt;Deseret Ice&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div align=\"center\" class=\"image-right\" style=\"width: 140px;\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"/north-couloir-of-deseret-peak/620013\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"North Couloir of Deseret Peak\" height=\"200\" width=\"134\" src=\"/images/small/620013.JPG\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=\"caption\"&gt;Ready to Ski&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br&gt;Deseret Peak is usually hiked between Memorial Day and late October.  Typical summer months apply but experienced climbers can climb year round.  Vehicle access on the gravel road is closed during the winter months, but the area could be accessed on skis or snowshoes, adding mileage to the approach.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The road is plowed up until the end of the paved road near the forest boundary.  This is where you will have to park during winter.  The road to the Loop Campground is popular with snowmobiles and skiers and is packed down pretty well.  Some people may not need skis or snowshoes until reaching the normal trailhead but it depends on current conditions.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;During light snow years it is possible to start near the normal trailhead.  The winter route generally follows the same route up South Willow Creek as in summer.  This drainage is steep in many parts.  It becomes easier walking along the ridgeline and the snow should be hard-crusted toward the summit.  Be careful during high avalanche conditions especially when climbing any of the couloir routes.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Thanks to SP member Moogie737 for the following info:  There is a steel gate which is usually closed on November 1st, meaning that one must hike or run or ATV or snowmobile the last 4 miles leading to the Loop CG. I am not sure when it opens in the spring.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_7\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Camping&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;div align=\"center\" class=\"image-left\" style=\"width: 206px;\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"/deseret-peak-summit/620010\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Deseret Peak Summit\" height=\"134\" width=\"200\" src=\"/images/small/620010.JPG\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=\"caption\"&gt;Deseret Summit&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div align=\"center\" class=\"image-right\" style=\"width: 206px;\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"/deseret-peak-from-south/110779\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Deseret Peak from South...\" height=\"150\" width=\"200\" src=\"/images/small/110779.JPG\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=\"caption\"&gt;Deseret Peak&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br&gt;This area has many campgrounds.  There are six campgrounds in South Willow Canyon.  They have picnic tables, fire pits, and restrooms.  They are usually open between late-May and mid-October.  All of them are on a first come, first serve basis, except for Upper Narrows Campground where you can reserve a large group campsite.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Camping is also available at the trailhead near the Loop Campground.  Individual sites cost about $14.00 a night.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Information on campgrounds can be found at this &lt;a href=\"http://www.fs.fed.us/r4/uwc/recreation/wcnf/camping/slrd/stansbury_mtn_cg.shtml\"&gt;&lt;b&gt;website&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Backcountry Camping Regulations:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Group size limit of 10 or less people, No mechanized vehicle use, including mountain bikes, are allowed on trails, camp at least 200 feet away from any road, hiking trail, or lake, and practice leave no trace techniques.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;South Willow Creek Camgpgrounds:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;1)&lt;/b&gt; Cottonwood Canyon Campground &ndash; Located 1 mile from the forest boundary.  2 campsites at an elevation of 6,080 feet.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;2)&lt;/b&gt; Intake Campground &ndash; Located 1.5 miles from the forest boundary.  4 campsites at an elevation of 6,320 feet.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;3)&lt;/b&gt; Boy Scout Campground &ndash; Located 1.7 miles from the forest boundary.  5 campsites.

When the Mormons first came to this new territory, they named the area The State of Deseret, which is a reference to the honey bee in &lt;i&gt;The Book of Mormon&lt;/i&gt;.  The Mormons regard the honey bee as a symbol of industriousness.  The beehive was adopted, in 1847, as an official emblem and represents the qualities of industry, perseverance, thrift, stability, and self-reliance, all virtues respected by the region\'s early settlers. The beehive can be seen as the centerpiece of the Utah Great Seal and the Utah State Flag.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Stansbury Range was named after Captain Howard Stansbury.  He was an early surveyor to the area.  Stansbury Island, at the southern end of the Great Salt Lake, was also named after him.  The island has a dirt road connecting it to the mainland.  He was sent to survey the Great Salt Lake area in 1850.  Tooele is the county\'s largest city, and took its name from the valley, which Captain Howard Stansbury spelled \"tuilla\" on his surveying maps in 1849-50.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Onaqui vs. Deseret&lt;/b&gt;: Thanks to &lt;a href=\"http://www.summitpost.org/mountains/user_link.pl?user_id=24013\"&gt;Dmitry&lt;/a&gt; for this information -- On the early maps, this range was named Onaqui Mountain. The first transcontinental survey placed a survey mark designated Onaqui on a prominent high point in this ridge, about 10 miles North of here, in 1887. Five years later they decided to place an additional benchmark at the highest point of the range, and named this second survey mark \"Deseret\". As it often happens, benchmark designation on the topo was co-opted as the name of the peak. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The name \"Onaqui\" is still used both for the Northern prominence of the Stansburies and for the Southern part of the range.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  &lt;a name=\"chapter_9\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Fire Info&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Patch Springs Fire was started on August 10, 2013 by lightning.  The fire stopped burning completely thanks to September rain and snow storms.  Its location is on the west and south side of the main ridgeline of Deseret Peak above Skull Valley in the Stansbury Mountains. The fire actually started farther south near Vickory Mountain and then worked its way north of Deseret Peak burning over 30,000 acres of land.  Luckily, none of the main hiking routes on the east side of Deseret Peak were burned by the fire.&lt;br&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_10\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Books&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;br&gt;1) &lt;b&gt;Utah Mountaineering Guide&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;By Michael R.

&lt;article&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_1\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2 id=\"first_h2\"&gt;Overview&lt;/h2&gt;Mount Powell sits on the Sierra Crest between Echo Col and Mount Thompson.  Depending on what map you are looking at and what guidebook you are reading, the name \"Mount Powell\" can refer to any one of the three summits on this section of the crest.  The western-most of the three summits is the 13,364\' peak now labelled \"Mount Powell\" on the most recent Mt. Darwin 7.5\' topo map.  The middle summit is the 13,356\' peak that has no name on the most recent map, but is called \"Mount Powell\" on the 1983 Mt. Darwin quad (this version is on Topozone even today -- click on the map link on the left page margin to see).  The third, easternmost summit is the unnamed and unnumbered peak at the 13,360\'+ contour just west of the Thompson-Powell Col.  This peak has never had an official name according to the USGS, but there is some debate over this point.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;To allay confusion (or to foster it, depending on your point of view), people have come to refer to these peaks in honor of the intrepid soul for whom \"Mount Powell\" was originally named in 1911 -- John Wesley Powell.  This annotated map shows the three peaks, and their informal names:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src=\"http://www.tahoebackcountry.net/features/powell/images/powell_map.jpg\"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In his book &lt;i&gt;High Sierra: Peaks, Passes and Trails\"&lt;/i&gt;, RJ Secor claims that the USGS in its original 1911 naming decision affixed the name Mount Powell to the eastern summit -- now known as \"Point Powell\":&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;\"Confusion has surrounded the naming of [Point Powell], formerly called \'Mount Powell.\'  In 1911, the Board of Geographic Names named a peak in memory of John Wesley Powell, the noted western explorer and former director of the United States Geological Survey. Unfortunately, on the Mount Goddard 15-minute map, the name was placed incorrectly on the lower, western summit of this plateau (Peak 13,356ft; UTM 554111), informally known as \'Point Wesley.\'  This error made its way into early editions of the Mount Darwin 7.5-minute map. The Board of Geographic Names detected this mistake in 1983 and directed the USGS Mapping Center to place the name Mount Powell on the third peak, previously called \'Point John\' (13,364ft; 1.4 mi SE of Mount Wallace; UTM 550113). While Point John may be the highest of the three points, it is not as prominent as Point Powell.\"&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Secor, 2d ed., page 281.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;While Secor is correct that Point Powell is more prominent than the other two \"Mount Powells\", he appears to be incorrect in stating that this peak in 1911 originally bore the name Mount Powell.  &lt;a href=\"http://www.climber.org/Secor/powell_usgs.html\"&gt;A letter from the USGS&lt;/a&gt; on this point seems to refute his claim, as it cites \"historical files for the 1911 decision pinpoint[ing] the location at [the current coordinates of Point John]\".&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Thus, most people now seem to agree that the real Mount Powell is the western peak, with a spot elevation of 13,364\'.  It is a shame that Point Powell has no official name -- it is one of the most beautiful and prominent unnamed Sierra peaks and deserving of its own identity.  Indeed, the &lt;a href=\"http://www.peakbagging.com/Peak%20notes/Powell.htm\"&gt;Sierra Peaks Section&lt;/a&gt; (SPS) of the Sierra Club has placed this unnamed peak on its peaks list, eschewing the \"real\" Mount Powell.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As Secor says, Point Powell is more prominent than its cousins.  It may also be higher than the other two.  The 7.5\' topo map (40 foot contour intervals) shows the summit as a closed contour at 13,360\' -- which means the peak may be anywhere between 13,360\' and 13,399\'.  Chances are it is higher than the \"real\" Mount Powell, which stands only 13,364\'.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mount Powell (\"Point John\").&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This peak is generally climbed from the vicinity of Echo Lake.  Head up a chute east of Echo Lake, then follow the snowramp all the way up to the summit ridge.  Here is a &lt;a href=\"http://www.thebackcountry.net/messagepics/powell1.jpg\"&gt;winter shot&lt;/a&gt; showing the entire route perfectly.  From the ridge, a short third class ridge traverse leads to the summit.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Point John can also be climbed as part of a link up with Points Powell and Wesley, via the Class 3-4 SW Ridge.  Bob Burd and group dayhiked the three Powell Peaks in August 2006 and after initially surveying the SW Ridge (\"It is a jumble of broken ridgeline with half a dozen gendarmes and what looks like a lot of crappy rock\") &lt;a href=\"http://www.snwburd.com/bob/trip_reports/point_powell_1.html\"&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; that this route was over highly enjoyable granite after an initial loose section.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Peak 13,360+ (\"Point Powell\").&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\"Point Powell\" is a beautiful mountain that offers challenging rock routes, a fun couloir climb, and an easier class 2 route via the Thompson-Powell Col.  The NE Couloir is probably best done in early spring to avoid the sandy scree at the top of the chute and danger of rockfall.  There are some very stout climbing routes on the NE Face of the peak, including a route pioneered by Galen Rowell.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;table class=\"inline_image_thumbs\"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=22738\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/22738.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=22737\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/22737.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Peak 13,356 (\"Point Wesley\").&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This is a bump on the south end of the Mt. Powell plateau.  It is an easy stroll from Point Powell, or Class 3-4 via the ridge connecting to Point John.&lt;a name=\"chapter_2\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Getting There&lt;/h2&gt;Mount Powell is usually approached from the Sabrina Basin, west of Bishop, CA.   Follow the Sabrina Basin trail past Blue, Baboon and Sunset Lakes, and up to the Thompson Glacier.  Mount Powell can also be approached from the west from the vicinity of LeConte Canyon in Kings Canyon National Park.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;table class=\"inline_image_thumbs\"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=22740\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/22740.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=22739\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/22739.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_3\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Red Tape&lt;/h2&gt;Mount Powell is on the border of the John Muir Wilderness and Kings Canyon National Park.  Both jurisdictions require a wilderness permit for overnight stays.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://www.fs.fed.us/r5/inyo/recreation/wild/\"&gt;John Muir Wilderness Info&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://www.nps.gov/seki/bc_permt.htm\"&gt;Kings Canyon Info&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Trailhead parking is free, about 1/2 mile from the actual trailhead (annoying...)&lt;br&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_4\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;When To Climb&lt;/h2&gt;Spring through Fall is the typical time to climb.  A winter approach is long, as it requires starting from the end of the plowed road at Aspendell.  Spring is probably the best time -- the fish are biting, the mosquitos aren\'t, and the scree and loose rock is covered in nice snow.&lt;br&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_5\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Camping&lt;/h2&gt;On the Sabrina side, good camping is available at Sunset Lake and Baboon Lakes.  Blue Lake is a little too crowded with day hikers for my tastes, and is much farther from the mountain.  Sunset Lake is stunning, with views of Thompson and Powell, but it is a high alpine lake (11,400\'+) with no sun protection.&lt;br&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_6\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Images&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div align=\"center\"&gt;&lt;table id=\"my_images\"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/hiking-along-sunset-lake-on/22740/c-151681\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\" Hiking along Sunset Lake on...\" src=\"/images/square/22740.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/climbers-returning-from-a/22743/c-151681\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\" Climbers returning from a...\" src=\"/images/square/22743.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/looking-out-over-half-frozen/22739/c-151681\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\" Looking out over half-frozen...\" src=\"/images/square/22739.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/point-powell-seen-from-the/22737/c-151681\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\" Point Powell, seen from the...\" src=\"/images/square/22737.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/climbing-the-ne-couloir-of/22742/c-151681\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\" Climbing the NE Couloir of...\" src=\"/images/square/22742.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/ascending-the-final-200/22738/c-151681\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\" Ascending the final 200\\\'...\" src=\"/images/square/22738.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/ascending-the-snow-apron/22741/c-151681\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\" Ascending the snow apron...\" src=\"/images/square/22741.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/mount-powell/843912/c-151681\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Mount Powell\" src=\"/images/square/843912.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/article&gt;date:difficulty:'),(87,151712,'/royce-peak/151712','/john-muir-wilderness/170988','Royce Peak','','','','13253','',12682,37.3189,-118.77,'California, United States, North America','','',170988,'John Muir Wilderness','','','','','','Mountain-Rock','content: &lt;article&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_1\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2 id=\"first_h2\"&gt;Overview&lt;/h2&gt;Royce Peak is located just over French Canyon, between the North Lake trailhead and the Pine Creek trailhead.  Royce Peak\'s remote location makes it a very long day hike, but it can be easily done as part of an overnight.  The easiest route up is a class 2 traverse from the saddle between Royce Peak and Merriam Peak, which can be approached either from the east or west.  From the tallest of the three summits on Royce one commands a view of a 10 square mile area.  Stretching from Bear Creek Spire in the North to Mt Darwin in the South, Mt Tom in the East and Mt Hooper to your west.&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;table class=\"inline_image_thumbs\"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=87113\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/87113.JPG\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=23842\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/23842.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=101479\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/101479.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_2\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Getting There&lt;/h2&gt;The two main trailheads for the approach to Royce Peak are Pine Creek trailhead and North Lake trailhead.  The Pine Creek trailhead can be reached by taking Highway 395 just North of Bishop and turning off toward the Pine Creek Pack station.  The North Lake trailhead can be reached by taking 395 just South of downtown Bishop, and turning onto Highway 168.  Take 168 for about 18 miles toward Lake Sabrina.  Just before Lake Sabrina turn off on a dirt road that winds up the hillside past North Lake.&lt;br&gt;From Pine Creek hike up the trail toward Pine Lake, until the trail comes to a minor junction at Honeymoon Lake.  From here continue South to Pine Creek Pass, from here one can base camp and make a summit attempt on Royce Peak. From North Lake take the Piute Pass trail up over the pass.  From Humphry\'s Basin one can either hike up over Carol Col or various passes to the north, or one can follow the trail down into Puttee Canyon until it reaches the junction with French Canyon.  Continue up French Canyon until you find a suitable campsite to make your summit attempt.  In French Canyon one obtains a view of the 400ft+ Royce Falls that cascades down from the lowest Royce Lake.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;table class=\"inline_image_thumbs\"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=23843\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/23843.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=113733\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/113733.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=86176\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/86176.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=101478\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/101478.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_3\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Red Tape&lt;/h2&gt;Overnight permits are required if one desires to stay anywhere within the John Muir Wilderness area.  These can either be picked up in Bishop or Lone Pine at the local ranger stations.  Bear Canisters are also required when starting out from both trailheads.&lt;br&gt;For permits and conditions contact the USFS Ranger Station in Bishop at 760-873-2500.&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://www.fs.fed.us/r5/inyo/\"&gt;Inyo National Forest&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_4\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;When To Climb&lt;/h2&gt;Climbing between June and October(first snow) is the best time.  In the Eastern approach to the saddle lies a permanent snow field.  In late June the snow field melts away enough so that one may beable to climb the basin without crampons or ice axes.  Prior to snow melt, ice axe and crampons may be needed to ascend this section to the saddle.  Snow melts fast on the rest of the approach.  In winter months snow shoes or cross-country skis would be needed for the long approach to the base.  Ice axes and crampons would be needed for a winter summit attempt.&lt;br&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_5\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Camping&lt;/h2&gt;Camping is allowed anywhere in the backcountry and around the mountain with proper overnight permits from the USFS.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_6\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Mountain Conditions&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://www.fs.fed.us/r5/inyo/currentconditions/index.html\"&gt;Inyo National Forest Road Conditions&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_7\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Images&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div align=\"center\"&gt;&lt;table id=\"my_images\"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/royce-lake-reflections/213964/c-151712\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Royce Lake Reflections\" src=\"/images/square/213964.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/royce-lake-panorama/537956/c-151712\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Royce Lake Panorama\" src=\"/images/square/537956.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/the-view-from-the-3rd-royce/24739/c-151712\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"The view from the 3rd Royce...\" src=\"/images/square/24739.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/reflections-at-3rd-royce/24742/c-151712\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Reflections at 3rd Royce...\" src=\"/images/square/24742.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/merriam-and-royce-peaks/418307/c-151712\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Merriam and Royce Peaks\" src=\"/images/square/418307.JPG\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/southwest-ridge-royce-peak/86087/c-151712\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Southwest ridge , Royce Peak\" src=\"/images/square/86087.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/royce-peak/783592/c-151712\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Royce Peak\" src=\"/images/square/783592.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/merriam-peak-royce-peak-and-feather-peak/742712/c-151712\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Merriam Peak, Royce Peak and Feather Peak\" src=\"/images/square/742712.JPG\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/royce-and-merriam-morning-light/666764/c-151712\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Royce and Merriam Morning Light\" src=\"/images/square/666764.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/royce-pass-aka-coco-la/113733/c-151712\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\'Royce Pass (aka \"Coco-La\"),...\' src=\"/images/square/113733.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/glacier-divide-from-the-3rd/24741/c-151712\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Glacier Divide from the 3rd...\" src=\"/images/square/24741.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view-to-the-upper-royce/24740/c-151712\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"View to the upper Royce...\" src=\"/images/square/24740.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/merriam-peak-and-royce/23843/c-151712\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Merriam Peak and Royce...\" src=\"/images/square/23843.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/royce-peak-from-one-of-the/87113/c-151712\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Royce peak from one of the...\" src=\"/images/square/87113.JPG\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td colspan=\"7\" align=\"center\"&gt;[ &lt;a href=\"/royce-peak/images/p-151712\"&gt;View Gallery - 16 More Images&lt;/a&gt; ]&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/article&gt;date:difficulty:'),(88,151751,'/grandeur-peak/151751','/wasatch-range-central/171209','Grandeur Peak','','','','8299','',39474,40.707,-111.759,'Utah, United States, North America','','',171209,'Wasatch Range (Central)','','','','','','Mountain-Rock','content: &lt;article&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_1\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2 id=\"first_h2\"&gt;Overview&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;a target=\"top\" href=\"http://www.summitpost.org/mountains/photo_link.pl/p/photo_id__167673__object_id__2099__type__mountain__mountain_id__2099__route_id____user_id____order_by____limit__\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"http://www.summitpost.org/images/original/114927.JPG\" title=\"Grandeur Peak Routes\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Overview of Routes on Grandeur Peak&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Grandeur Peak is the western-most peak on the ridge separating Parleys Canyon on the north and Mill Creek Canyon on the south.  Its proximity to the Salt Lake valley makes it a popular hike, which can be completed in several hours or less.  For more advanced hikers, Grandeur Peak is the starting point of the challenging &lt;a href=\"http://www.summitpost.org/show/route_link.pl/route_id/4600/object_id/2099\"&gt;Mill Creek Ridge&lt;/a&gt; route.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Distance of &plusmn;6.0 miles round trip from the trailhead at the end of Church Fork Road, with an elevation gain of 2,340 feet.  The Church Fork trailhead elevation is 5,960 feet.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The steeper West Ridge route gains approximately 3,200 feet in just 2.5 miles.  This gives an elevation gain of 1,280 ft/mile, undoubtably one of the steepest hikes on the Wasatch Front.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;USGS Quads:&lt;br&gt;&lt;li&gt;Sugar House, Utah  (1:24k)&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Mount Aire, Utah  (1:24k)&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Salt Lake City, Utah  (1:100k)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;table class=\"inline_image_thumbs\"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=75895\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/75895.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=81117\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/81117.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=26010\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/26010.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=81115\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/81115.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=99691\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/99691.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_2\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Getting There&lt;/h2&gt;The most common routes which are used to ascend Grandeur Peak include:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://www.summitpost.org/show/route_link.pl/route_id/1999/object_id/2099\"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Church Fork&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;: &lt;br&gt;From I-215 on the east side of Salt Lake valley, take either the 3300 or 3900 South exit, and proceed east to Wasatch Boulevard.  Follow Wasatch Boulevard to 3800 South, and look for signs to Mill Creek Canyon.  Proceed approximately 3.75 miles up Mill Creek Canyon to the Church Fork picnic area on the left.  Park either along the road or in the small parking area at the trailhead, approximately &frac12; mile from the main road.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://www.summitpost.org/show/route_link.pl/route_id/2040/object_id/2099\"&gt;&lt;b&gt;West Slopes&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;br&gt;From I-215 on the east side of Salt Lake valley, take the 3300 South exit, and proceed east to Wasatch Boulevard.  For northbound traffic there is no offramp at 3300 South, so take the 3900 South exit and follow Wasatch Boulvard north approximately 1 mile to 3300 South.  From the intersection with 3300 South, follow Wasatch Boulevard north to approximately 2900 South, where a gated parking area marks the end of the road and the trailhead.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://www.summitpost.org/show/route_link.pl/route_id/4363/object_id/2099\"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Pharaohs Glen&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;br&gt;This route begins near exit 131 of I-80, approximately 2 miles east from the mouth of Parleys Canyon.  There is no offramp at this exit for eastbound traffic; proceed another mile east along I-80 to exit 132, then backtrack one mile west to exit 131.  Westbound traffic may exit directly at exit 131.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://www.summitpost.org/show/route_link.pl/route_id/5069/object_id/2099\"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Dragon\'s Tail Ridge&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;br&gt;Begins from same trailhead as the West Slopes route.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;See the \'Routes\' section of this page for details on ascending the peak from each of these routes.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;table class=\"inline_image_thumbs\"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=25013\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/25013.JPG\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=25011\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/25011.JPG\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=25014\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/25014.JPG\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=25009\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/25009.JPG\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=25010\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/25010.JPG\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_3\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Red Tape&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;i&gt;Church Fork&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;br&gt;This route begins in Mill Creek Canyon, which is a fee area.  A toll booth is located approximately 1.5 miles up the canyon, and collects a fee of $3.00 per vehicle as you &lt;font color=\"red\"&gt;&lt;b&gt;exit&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt; the canyon.  Annual passes may also be purchased for $40.00  There is only room for 8 cars at the trailhead in Church Fork picnic area, and the picnic area gate closes at 10:00 pm. Parking in the picnic area parking stalls for trailhead access is not permitted.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;i&gt;West Slopes&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;br&gt;Although it begins from a public access area, this route passes very near a residential area; be considerate of the property owners when passing near these areas.  The trailhead parking area gate is closed at 10:00pm each night, so plan your return to the trailhead accordingly.  The beginning of this route has been closed due to trail restoration since early summer 2011 - a short (&plusmn;0.1 mile) trail to the north bypasses this area.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;i&gt;Pharaohs Glen&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;br&gt;This route begins on private property.  Be very respectful of the property owners when using this route, and be aware that the owners reserve the right to deny access at any time.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;i&gt;Dragon\'s Tail Ridge&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;br&gt;Same as West Slopes route.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;table class=\"inline_image_thumbs\"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=99930\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/99930.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=107558\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/107558.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=47883\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/47883.JPG\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=122392\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/122392.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_4\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Additional Information&lt;/h2&gt;Additional web sites of interest:&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://fs.usda.gov/wps/portal/fsinternet/!ut/p/c5/04_SB8K8xLLM9MSSzPy8xBz9CP0os3gjAwhwtDDw9_AI8zPwhQoY6IeDdGCqCPOBqwDLG-AAjgb6fh75uan6BdnZaY6OiooA1tkqlQ!!/dl3/d3/L2dJQSEvUUt3QS9ZQnZ3LzZfMjAwMDAwMDBBODBPSEhWTjBNMDAwMDAwMDA!/?ss=110419&amp;amp;navtype=forestBean&amp;amp;navid=091000000000000&amp;amp;pnavid=null&amp;amp;cid=null&amp;amp;ttype=main&amp;amp;pname=Wasatch-Cache%20National%20Forest%20-%20Home/\"&gt;Uinta-Wasatch-Cache&lt;/a&gt; National Forest Website&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Climb-Utah &lt;a href=\"http://climb-utah.com/WM/grandeur.htm\"&gt;Grandeur Peak&lt;/a&gt; Page&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Utah &lt;a href=\"http://www.avalanche.org/~uac/\"&gt;Avalanche Center&lt;/a&gt; website&lt;br&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_5\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Web Cam&lt;/h2&gt;Webcam looking up the west ridge of Grandeur Peak.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src=\"http://img.bonnint.net/slc/weather/cam_uppermillcreek.jpg\"&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_6\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Mountain Conditions&lt;/h2&gt;The 7-day forecast below is for the Wasatch Front valleys - expect considerably colder and more severe weather in the mountains.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img width=\"440\" height=\"297\" src=\"http://connect2utah.com/wx/kutv_saltlake_7day_16x9.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/center&gt;                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          &lt;div align=\"center\"&gt;&lt;a name=\"messages\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_7\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Additions and Corrections&lt;/h2&gt;[ &lt;a href=\"/object_discussion.php?type=vote_comments&amp;amp;object_id=151751&amp;amp;is_addition=1#vote_form\"&gt;Post an Addition or Correction&lt;/a&gt; ]&lt;table cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" style=\"width: 775px;\"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;table cellpadding=\"2\" cellspacing=\"2\" width=\"100%\"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;&lt;span class=\"pagertext\"&gt;Viewing: &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;-&lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt; of &lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td align=\"center\"&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td align=\"right\"&gt;    &lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;table border=\"0\" width=\"775\" class=\"messages\"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td width=\"110\" align=\"left\" valign=\"top\" style=\"padding-top: 6px;\"&gt;&lt;a name=\"373149\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a class=\"dis_user_lnk\" href=\"/users/sarah-simon/35029\"&gt;Sarah Simon&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td valign=\"top\" style=\"padding-top: 6px;\"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Minor typo&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td align=\"right\" valign=\"top\" nowrap style=\"font-size: 10px;\"&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td valign=\"top\" rowspan=\"2\" align=\"left\" style=\"padding-top: 6px;\"&gt;&lt;p class=\"disc_avatar\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"/users/sarah-simon/35029\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Sarah Simon\" width=\"50\" height=\"50\" border=\"0\" src=\"/images/avatars/909498.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=\"font-size: 9px; color: #888;\"&gt;Hasn\'t voted&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td colspan=\"2\" style=\"padding-top: 6px;\"&gt;Hey there,&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Very minor spelling error in the \"Getting There\" section that I wish to bring to your attention as a courtesy:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Church Fork&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This route begins in Mill Creek Canyon, which is a fee area.

The peak is most reknowned for some enjoyable technical climbs on its northwest face, but also offers some pleasant scrambling up its easier southern and western slopes.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In addition to the fine climbing, there are also superb panoramic views from the summit--because of its central location, perhaps some of the best in the park--taking in Half Dome and the Valley to the west, the Clark Range to the south, the Cathedral Range to the east, as well as the canyons and Sawtooth Range of northern Yosemite.  This is a great peak for very little effort.&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;table class=\"inline_image_thumbs\"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=31066\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/31066.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=33366\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/33366.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=25798\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/25798.JPG\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=57985\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/57985.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=58199\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/58199.JPG\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_2\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Routes Overview&lt;/h2&gt;The most popular route on the peak may be the &lt;a href=\"http://www.summitpost.com/show/route_link.pl/route_id/1942/object_id/2140\"&gt;NW Buttress&lt;/a&gt; (5.5), an enjoyable climb up friction slabs.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A variety of non-technical routes may also be found.  A class 2-3 scramble up the &lt;a href=\"http://www.summitpost.com/show/route_link.pl/route_id/1946/object_id/2140\"&gt;West Face&lt;/a&gt; leads from the parking lot east of Tenaya Lake up through meadows, slabs, and talus to meet the ridge; head east along the ridge to the summit.  This is perhaps the easiest descent route also.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The &lt;a href=\"http://www.summitpost.com/show/route_link.pl/route_id/1949/object_id/2140\"&gt;southwest ridge&lt;/a&gt; may be followed from near Tenaya Lake; this features some class 3 slabs.  The south side of the peak is class 1 from Mildred Lake; follow sandy slopes up to the summit.  A use trail may be found in places here.&lt;br&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_3\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Getting There&lt;/h2&gt;Tenaya Lake is located directly off Tioga Road, a couple of miles to the east of Olmstead Point and just a few miles west of &lt;a href=\"http://summitpost.com/mountains/mountain_link.pl/mountain_id/759\"&gt;Tuolumne Meadows&lt;/a&gt;.  The peak is located immediately east-southeast of the lake.&lt;br&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_4\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Red Tape&lt;/h2&gt;Permits are not required for day hikes, but a wilderness permit is required for overnight visits. This can be obtained from any ranger station in the park. The nearest location is the permit building just east of the Tuolumne Meadows campground. It is just off the road that leads to the Tuolumne Lodge, on the right hand side.  See the &lt;a href=\"http://summitpost.com/mountains/mountain_link.pl/mountain_id/759\"&gt;Tuolumne Meadows&lt;/a&gt; pages for additional red tape.&lt;br&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_5\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;When To Climb&lt;/h2&gt;Due to the winter closure of Tioga Road, Tenaya Peak is most easily climbed between May and November.  Expect to encounter snow if you venture out here early in the season; snow patches can linger on the NW Buttress through June or early July.  These can be easily spotted from Tioga Road.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_6\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Camping&lt;/h2&gt;Backcountry campsites can be found at Mildred Lake.  Camping can also be found in the Tuolumne Meadows backpacker\'s campground, located a few miles east of the peak, on the south side of Tioga Road.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The summit is just a couple of miles from the road, with only a couple of thousand feet elevation gain, so the peak is easily climbed in just a few hours.  There\'s really no need to camp here.  Instead, it makes a fine half-day climb (or less).&lt;br&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_7\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Mountain Conditions&lt;/h2&gt;Current conditions can be found on the &lt;a href=\"http://www.nps.gov/yose/\"&gt;NPS page&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The &lt;a href=\"http://www.wrh.noaa.gov/total_forecast/index.php?minlon=-121.29&amp;amp;maxlon=-117.61&amp;amp;minlat=34.76&amp;amp;maxlat=38.27&amp;amp;mapwidth=354&amp;amp;map.x=270&amp;amp;map.y=163\"&gt;NWS Forecast&lt;/a&gt; tends to be the most reliable source of weather information for the area.&lt;br&gt;'),(91,151803,'/mount-watson/151803','/western-uinta-lakes-roadless-area/171016','Mount Watson','','','','11527','',44489,40.698,-110.979,'Utah, United States, North America','','',171016,'Western Uinta / Lakes Roadless Area','','','','','','Mountain-Rock','content: &lt;article&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_1\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2 id=\"first_h2\"&gt;Overview&lt;/h2&gt;The Uinta Mountains are one of the few mountain ranges in North America that run east to west rather than north to south. Within the Uinta Mountains are about 2000 lakes, and some 900-1000 are full of trout. Along with the San Juans in Colorado, the Uintas have more contiguous area above timberline than any other area in the Continental United States. This is a beautiful area with many lakes, meadows, wildflowers, and some rugged peaks. Solitude is usually easy to come by once you leave the popular fishing holes behind. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Mt. Watson is an enjoyable climb in the Western Uinta Mountains. Many fishing lakes surround the peak, and dozens of them are visible from the summit. The peak is fairly easy to reach, but most of the time the hike still offers solitude. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div align=\"center\" class=\"image\" style=\"width: 506px;\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"/mt-watson-viewed-from/211257\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Mt.

Crystal Lake is reached from the Trial Lake spur road off Highway 150 25.7 miles east and north of Kamas. Follow the signs along the spur road to Crystal Lake. This gravel road is good for all vehicles. This is the trailhead for both the Watson Pass/South Ridge and North-East Ridge routes. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Middle Fork Weber River Trailhead&lt;/b&gt;  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;From Oakley (State Route 32), turn east on the Weber Canyon Road. Follow this road east for about 12 miles to where the Smith and Morehouse Road turns south. Go straight and pass under the big ranch gate that says \"Thousand Oaks Ranch\". This is a public road, the ranch just wants to make it look private. Read the sign that informs you that either side of the road is private land for the next several miles. The land between Thousand Oaks and Holiday Park is private, so stay on the main road and don\'t camp along it. Follow the good gravel road to Holiday Park. Once at Holiday Park, follow Uinta Road to the parking lot and outhouse at the trailhead. Do not cross the river on the 4wd road, look for a sign pointing out the trail to Abes Lake and Crystal Lake. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div align=\"center\" class=\"image\" style=\"width: 506px;\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"/mount-watson-from-the-south/84126\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Mount Watson from the south...\" height=\"375\" width=\"500\" src=\"/images/medium/84126.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=\"caption\"&gt;Mount Watson from the south and Washington Lake.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_3\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Routes Overview&lt;/h2&gt;There are many routes available to climb the Mount Watson, and the peak can be climbed from almost every direction.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The easiest route is from &lt;a href=\"http://www.summitpost.org/show/route_link.pl/route_id/1988/object_id/2168\"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Watson Pass and the South Ridge&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.  The route heads west from Crystal Lake to Watson Pass, and then follows the ridge north to the summit.  This route is about 4.5 miles round trip with 1700 feet elevation gain.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The second easiest route is probably the &lt;a href=\"http://www.summitpost.org/show/route_link.pl/route_id/1988/object_id/2168\"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Northwest Ridge from Clyde Lake&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.  The route follows the Notch Mountain trail north, past Wall and Hope Lakes to the base of the Notch.  The route then heads west to Clyde Lake and climbs the NE Ridge of Watson to the summit.  This route is about 8 miles round trip with 1700 feet elevation gain.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div align=\"center\" class=\"image\" style=\"width: 506px;\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"/mt-watson-from-clyde-lake/80854\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Mt.

This is the longest route described and is climbed very seldom.  The trails in the Middle Fork Basin are not well defined and route-finding skills are needed.  The round trip distance is 16 miles for this route.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div align=\"center\" class=\"image\" style=\"width: 506px;\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"/gazing-towards-the-spine/211251\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Gazing towards the spine...\" height=\"375\" width=\"500\" src=\"/images/medium/211251.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=\"caption\"&gt;View Northeast from the summit.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_4\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Guidebook Available&lt;/h2&gt;More details about the area can be found in the book Western Uinta Backcountry Guide, including many routes to the summit, and hiking trails to the many lakes, and fishing information.

Highway 150 is closed in winter, and it is a long snowshoe or ski in, making it a multi day trip in winter unless you have access to a snowmobile.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div align=\"center\" class=\"image\" style=\"width: 506px;\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"/mt-watson-utah-from-haystack/36890\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Mt Watson, Utah from Haystack...\" height=\"384\" width=\"500\" src=\"/images/medium/36890.JPG\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=\"caption\"&gt;Mt Watson, Utah from Haystack Mtn in late July.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_7\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Camping&lt;/h2&gt;There are many campgrounds along Highway 150, but they can get crowded on summer weekends, especially during holidays.

Within the Uinta Mountains are about 2000 lakes, and some 900-1000 are full of trout. Along with the San Juans in Colorado, the Uintas have more contiguous area above timberline than any other area in the Continental United States. This is a beautiful area with many lakes, meadows, wildflowers, and some rugged peaks. Solitude is usually easy to come by once you leave the popular fishing holes behind. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Reids Peak is the premier peak in the Western Uinta Mountains. The summit isn\'t visited that often considering that the peak is near one of the most popular vacation spots in the state (Mirror Lake). It is a rugged and impressive peak, and is surrounded by many fishing lakes. Reids Peak is the \"satellite\" peak to Bald Mountain. Even though it is slightly lower than Bald Mountain, it is much more challenging to climb. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div align=\"center\" class=\"image\" style=\"width: 506px;\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"/the-northeast-face-of-reids-peak/412777\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"The Northeast Face of Reids Peak\" height=\"375\" width=\"500\" src=\"/images/medium/412777.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=\"caption\"&gt;NE face of Reids Peak&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_2\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Getting There&lt;/h2&gt;The main access route to the peak is from the Bald Mountain Trailhead. This signed trailhead is located off Highway 150 29 miles east and north of Kamas or 49 miles south of Evanston. There is a sign that marks the trailhead. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Another access is from the Pass Lake Trailhead, which is located off Highway 150 32 miles north, and east of Kamas or 46 miles south of Evanston. There is a sign that marks the trailhead. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div align=\"center\" class=\"image\" style=\"width: 506px;\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"/reids-peak-left-and-bald/84156\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Reids Peak (left) and Bald...\" height=\"375\" width=\"500\" src=\"/images/medium/84156.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=\"caption\"&gt;Bald Moutain (right) and Reids Peak (left)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_3\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Routes Overview&lt;/h2&gt;All routes are for experienced scramblers.  I have used two route to climb the peak, and both routes make the final climb from the Southeast Ridge.  Other routes are available if you look for them. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Southwest Ridge can be approached from the west and &lt;a href=\"http://www.summitpost.org/show/route_link.pl/route_id/1989/object_id/2169\"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Notch Mountain Trail&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt; This is the easiest route to the summit of Reids Peak.  The trail follows the Notch Mountain Trail to where the trail curves around Bald Mountain.  The pass between Bald Mountain can be accessed by cross-country routes anywhere from the curve to Notch Lake.  The final portion of the route along the SE ridge is a fun scramble with several small cliff obstacles. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Southeast Ridge can also be approached from the east and &lt;a href=\"http://www.summitpost.org/show/route_link.pl/route_id/1990/object_id/2169\"&gt;&lt;b&gt;via Pass Lake&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.  This is the shortest route to Reids Peak, but it is slightly more difficult and rugged than the Notch Mountain Trail route.  From Pass Lake, the route heads SW (no trail) to the base of the Bald/Reids Pass, at which point the route scrambles up the very steep slope to the pass.  The route to the summit from the pass is the same as the route described above. &lt;br&gt;&lt;div align=\"center\" class=\"image\" style=\"width: 506px;\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"/red-notch-mountain-trail-sw/107909\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Red = Notch Mountain Trail-SW...\" height=\"375\" width=\"500\" src=\"/images/medium/107909.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=\"caption\"&gt;Reids Peak Routes&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_4\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Guidebook Available&lt;/h2&gt;More details about the area can be found in the book Western Uinta Backcountry Guide, including many routes to the summit, and hiking trails to the many lakes, and fishing information.  Just send me a PM if you want to purchase the book.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;SP members can have the book for 1/2 price, and there is no shipping cost.&lt;br&gt;&lt;div align=\"center\" class=\"image-left\" style=\"width: 206px;\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"/western-uinta-backcountry-guide/176734\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Western Uinta Backcountry Guide\" height=\"200\" width=\"200\" src=\"/images/small/176734.JPG\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=\"caption\"&gt;Guidebook&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_5\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Red Tape&lt;/h2&gt;There is a $3 access fee for parking anywhere along Highway 150.&lt;br&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_6\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;When To Climb&lt;/h2&gt;July through September is the normal hiking season.

The trail to the summit offers the beginner hiker a taste of what it is like to stand on top of an alpine summit.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div align=\"center\" class=\"image\" style=\"width: 506px;\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"/reids-peak-left-bald/84095\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Reids Peak (left), Bald...\" height=\"375\" width=\"500\" src=\"/images/medium/84095.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=\"caption\"&gt;Reids Peak (left), Bald Mountain (right).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_2\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Getting There&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Bald Mountain Trailhead&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;To reach the Bald Mountain Trailhead, either drive east and north of Kamas along Highway 150 for 29 miles from Kamas; or south on Highway 150 49 miles south of Evanston.

This is by far the easiest and most popular route to the mountain, and is probably used for  well over 99% of the ascents of the peak.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There are several more challenging routes available.  The &lt;a href=\"http://www.summitpost.org/show/route_link.pl/route_id/2501/object_id/2170\"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Northwest Ridge from the Notch Mountain Trail&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt; makes a good route.

Within the Uinta Mountains are about 2000 lakes, and some 900-1000 are full of trout. Along with the San Juans in Colorado, the Uintas have more contiguous area above timberline than any other area in the Continental United States. This is a beautiful area with many lakes, meadows, wildflowers, and some rugged peaks. Solitude is usually easy to come by once you leave the popular fishing holes behind. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This peak is a frequently viewed, but seldom climbed summit. The peak forms part of the backdrop to Trial Lake. The mountain itself is divided into two halves by The Notch, which is the mountains namesake. The peak is easy to reach, but still almost always offers solitude. This is a very scenic area! &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div align=\"center\" class=\"image\" style=\"width: 506px;\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"/notch-mountain-from-bench/36893\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Notch Mountain from Bench...\" height=\"447\" width=\"500\" src=\"/images/medium/36893.JPG\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=\"caption\"&gt;Notch Mountain from Bench Lake.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_2\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Getting There&lt;/h2&gt;There are two trailheads normally used for the climb.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Crystal Lake Trailhead&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Crystal Lake is reached from the Trial Lake spur road off Highway 150 25.7 miles east and north of Kamas.  Follow the signs along the spur road to Crystal Lake.  The spur road is gravel and is good for all vehicles.  A sign marks the trailhead.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Bald Mountain Trailhead&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This signed trailhead is located off Highway 150 on the west side 29 miles east and north of Kamas, or 49 miles south of Evanston.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div align=\"center\" class=\"image\" style=\"width: 506px;\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"/trial-lake-with-notch/81021\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Trial Lake with Notch...\" height=\"375\" width=\"500\" src=\"/images/medium/81021.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=\"caption\"&gt;Trial Lake with Notch Mountain in the background.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_3\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Routes Overview&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://www.summitpost.org/show/route_link.pl/route_id/1994/object_id/2171\"&gt;&lt;b&gt;The Notch Lake Route&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt; climbs the eastern (highest) half of Notch Mountain.  See the route page for details.  Briefly put:  From the Bald Mountain Trailhead, follow the trail west that is posted for Notch Lake.  Follow the trail to the lake.  The route then climbs climb cross-country through the benches to the southwest and climb up to the south ridge of the summit of Notch Mountain. The route then scrambles and up the steep ridge to a false summit. The highest peak can be reached by heading west along the ridge for .5 miles. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://www.summitpost.org/show/route_link.pl/route_id/1993/object_id/2171\"&gt;&lt;b&gt;The Notch Route&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt; can be used to climb either summit (east or west) of Notch Mountain.  See the route page for details.  Breifly put:  From the Crystal Lake Trailhead, the route follows the trail north that is posted for Wall Lake. Wall Lake is reached shortly after a junction with a spur trail coming from Trail Lake. From Wall Lake, the trail switchbacks up to tiny Hope Lake. From here the trail heads northwest to near Twin Lakes and climbs to The Notch, which is a 10,600 feet high pass. Either peak of Notch Mountain can be climbed from the pass. The west summit is 11,258 feet high and the east summit is 11,267 feet high. The east peak requires a very steep scramble, and route-finding around a few cliffs. The west summit involves steep route-finding and boulder-hopping, but is an easier ascent. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div align=\"center\" class=\"image\" style=\"width: 420px;\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view-from-near-the-east-summit/211241\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"View from near the east summit\" height=\"500\" width=\"414\" src=\"/images/medium/211241.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=\"caption\"&gt;Last leg of the approach to the east summit.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_4\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Guidebook Available&lt;/h2&gt;More details about the area can be found in the book Western Uinta Backcountry Guide, including many routes to the summit, and hiking trails to the many lakes, and fishing information.

Being in the Mount Whitney/Mount Langley region causes Mount Corcoran to receive only a handful of visitors each year. The actual summit of Corcoran is the highest of four bumps along the ridgeline that runs South from Mount LeConte. Mount Corcoran is not a prominent point from either Lone Pine or Miter Basin, but it offers many fun routes for climbers of all abilities. The easiest route is the climb via from the North Notch, which is a mixture of Class 2-3. &lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;table class=\"inline_image_thumbs\"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=26669\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/26669.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=53721\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/53721.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=26663\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/26663.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=144786\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/144786.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_2\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Getting There&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;br&gt;Mount Corcoran can be reached from the Meysan Lakes area, the Turtle Creek drainage, or Miter Basin.  For the Meysan Lakes approach, take highway 395 to Lone Pine, then turn onto Whitney Portal road.  Follow this road until one reaches a locked gate on the road next to the Whitney Portal campgrounds. Signs point through the campground and up a back road to the Meysan Lakes trail.  Follow this trail to upper Meysan Lake, then climb one of the many chutes to the plateau between LeConte and Mallory. This route requires some tricky route finding on a traverse around the backside of LeConte.  For the Turtle Creek approach take Whitney Portal road as above, but turn onto Horseshoe Meadows Rd.  Then turn into either the Turtle Creek Campground or down Granite view road.  From the end of either road hike up the Turtle Creek drainage.  The Miter Basin approach can be reached from the Horseshoe Meadows trailhead at the end of Horseshoe Meadow Road(directions above). &lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;table class=\"inline_image_thumbs\"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=26664\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/26664.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=32870\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/32870.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_3\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Red Tape&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;br&gt;No permits are required for day hikes on any of the routes, but the normal overnight permit is required for all that spend at least one night in the backcountry.  These permits can be acquired at the Forest Service Ranger Station in Lone Pine.

In early season and after the first snow crampons and ice axes are often required.  Snow ascents are possible either via Meysan Lakes or Tuttle Creek.&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;table class=\"inline_image_thumbs\"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=53722\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/53722.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=53727\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/53727.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_5\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Camping&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;br&gt;There are many overnight campsites around the starting points of the climb.  Tuttle Creek campground and the Horseshoe Meadow campground usually have open spots for camping.  The Whitney Portal campground at the base of the Meysan Lakes trail is often full.  An overnight fee is required for all campsites. Backcountry permits are usually plentiful and can be reserved ahead of time for $5 a person.

Secor shows a map specifically directing that you head up the chute to the right of the Tuttle Obelisk. I did so and climbed up for over 1500 ft to what I expected to be a pass over to the bowls at the base of comb ridge. In fact a came to a huge drop off from where I was looking across the next huge gully system - the one uphill of the Tuttle Obelisk and obviously the one I wanted to be in. Oh well, nice view anyway.

Yet as a climb, it is overshadowed by nearby Whitney.  However, it is a cool climb with some interesting routefinding and great views of the Whitney Region.  It\'s class 2, but seems most people can\'t find the entire class 2 route on the way up and end up doing some class 3.  Overall, there are a variety of established routes, from Class 1 walk-ups to 5.10 A2 routes and 5.10d free climbs.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;See R. J. Secor &lt;a href=\"http://summitpost.com/mountains/book_query.pl/object_id/2193/sort_by/submission_date\"&gt;The High Sierra: Peaks, Passes and Trails&lt;/a&gt; for more information.&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;table class=\"inline_image_thumbs\"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=43192\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/43192.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=55584\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/55584.JPG\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_2\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Getting There&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;br&gt;To get to the Whitney Portal, take the Whitney Portal Road west from Lone Pine for 12 miles until the road ends.  Hike up the Whitney trail to Mirror Lake - approx. 3 1/2 miles.  Climb directly up from Mirror Lake.  About half way up there is a cliff band you need to negotiate - there is a class 2 route through this, but if you can\'t find it, there are class 3 routes as well.  The ground is pretty solid up to this cliff band, but then it turns to scree above.  The route we took from here was to the right as you look uphill ( roughly east of the summit ) and up one of the chutes that are visible as you trudge your way up the scree.  Supposedly, you can also head to the sandy plateau on the left for another route.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Thor Peak may also be approached from the North Fork of Lone Pine Peak.&lt;br&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_3\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Red Tape&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;br&gt;If you plan to hike along the Mt. Whitney Trail past Mirror Lake to climb Thor Peak you must obtain a Mt. Whitney Trail wilderness permit.  These permits can be notoriously difficult to obtain.  Most climbers apply for them months in advance to climb during the late spring through fall.   Up to 100% of the permits allotted each day under the trailhead quota for entry from May 1 through November 1 are granted through a lottery. The first round of the lottery is held each February.  Permits for overnight visits are usually more difficult to obtain than day visit permits, and competition for a permit is usually greater for weekends than weekdays.  Climbers may also obtain permits by arriving at the Lone Pine Ranger Station the morning before beginning a climb, although obtaining a permit this way is more uncertain and often more competitive.  Mt. Whitney Trail wilderness permit information may be found &lt;a href=\"http://www.fs.fed.us/r5/inyo/recreation/wild/permits_res/how_to.html\"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"http://www.fs.fed.us/r5/inyo/recreation/mt_whitney.html\"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; or call (760) 873-2483.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Another alternative approach is to climb the peak from the North Fork side of Lone Pine Creek.  No day permit is needed for approaching the climb from the North Fork of Lone Pine Creek.  Trialhead use quotas are in effect from May 1 though November 1, so climbers should consider obtaining overnight permits as far in advance as possible.  Permit reservations for the North Fork of Lone Pine Creek cost $5 per person.  Climbers may also obtain permits by arriving at the Lone Pine Ranger Station the morning before beginning a climb.  More information on wilderness permits may be found &lt;a href=\"http://www.fs.fed.us/r5/inyo/recreation/wild/permits_res/how_to.html\"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; or call (760) 873-2483.&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;table class=\"inline_image_thumbs\"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=43194\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/43194.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=43195\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/43195.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_4\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;When To Climb&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;br&gt;Year round, but keep in mind that the Whitney Portal Road is closed during the Winter, adding several snowy miles to the approach.&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;table class=\"inline_image_thumbs\"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=43197\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/43197.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_5\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Camping&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;br&gt;Climbers may camp at Whitney Portal, but &lt;a href=\"http://www.reserveusa.com/\"&gt;reservations&lt;/a&gt; are recommended.  Whitney Portal Campground also has 10 walk-in sites that are first-come, first served, but these sites fill up pretty quickly on weekends.  There are also two good campgrounds outside of Lone Pine: Lone Pine Campground, which also accepts &lt;a href=\"http://www.reserveusa.com/\"&gt;reservations&lt;/a&gt;, and a BLM campground, &lt;a href=\"http://www.ca.blm.gov/bishop/tuttle.html\"&gt;Tuttle Creek&lt;/a&gt;, which is generally open March 7 through November 1.  Although it lacks running water, Tuttle Creek is free, requires no reservations, and usually has sites available.  You can also backpack into Bighorn Park, which is approximately 3 miles up the Whitney Trail.  Camping is not allowed at Mirror Lake at the time of this writing.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Alternatively, you can backpack up to Upper Boy Scout Lake along the North Fork of Lone Pine Creek (see \"Red Tape\" above for information on obtaining a wilderness permit for the North Fork of Lone Pine Peak).&lt;br&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_6\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;External Links&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://community.webshots.com/album/415135848ElREjb\"&gt;Photos of my hike to Thor Peak on 8/6/05&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt; Thor Peak via North Fork Lone Pine Creek Trail and Lower Boy Scout Lake&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;div align=\"center\"&gt;&lt;a name=\"messages\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_7\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Additions and Corrections&lt;/h2&gt;[ &lt;a href=\"/object_discussion.php?type=vote_comments&amp;amp;object_id=151824&amp;amp;is_addition=1#vote_form\"&gt;Post an Addition or Correction&lt;/a&gt; ]&lt;table cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" style=\"width: 775px;\"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;table cellpadding=\"2\" cellspacing=\"2\" width=\"100%\"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;&lt;span class=\"pagertext\"&gt;Viewing: &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;-&lt;b&gt;3&lt;/b&gt; of &lt;b&gt;3&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td align=\"center\"&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td align=\"right\"&gt;    &lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;table border=\"0\" width=\"775\" class=\"messages\"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td width=\"110\" align=\"left\" valign=\"top\" style=\"padding-top: 6px;\"&gt;&lt;a name=\"120177\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a class=\"dis_user_lnk\" href=\"/users/thebeave7/13131\"&gt;thebeave7&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td valign=\"top\" style=\"padding-top: 6px;\"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Untitled Comment&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td align=\"right\" valign=\"top\" nowrap style=\"font-size: 10px;\"&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td valign=\"top\" rowspan=\"2\" align=\"left\" style=\"padding-top: 6px;\"&gt;&lt;p class=\"disc_avatar\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"/users/thebeave7/13131\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"thebeave7\" width=\"50\" height=\"50\" border=\"0\" src=\"/images/avatars/513458.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=\"font-size: 9px; color: #888;\"&gt;Voted 8/10&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td colspan=\"2\" style=\"padding-top: 6px;\"&gt;There is also a route that takes off from Lower Boy Scout lake.

Located in the High Sierra, this peak is climbed infrequently: probably no more than once every 3-4 years or so.  Isosceles is adjacent to Columbine Peak, sharing a ridgeline.  Nearby peaks such as Mt. Winchell, Thunderbolt, Starlight, and the North Palisades attract more attention.  However, the views from Isosceles\' summit are outstanding.  It is an excellent, pleasurable \"easy-day\" outing from either Dusy Basin or Palisade Basin.   &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;R.J. Secor\'s book, \"The High Sierra: Peaks, Passes, &amp;amp; Trails\" (2nd ed; 1999) has an excellent \"signature photo\" showing the overall geometric shape on page 231.

Drive 5.8 miles to South Lake &amp;amp; the trailhead; this road follows the South Fork of Bishop Creek and passes several resorts.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Isosceles is most easily accessed via the Bishop Pass Trail,  one of the most heavily utilized trails in the High Sierra.  Permits are required; &lt;a href=\"http://www.fs.fed.us/r5/inyo/recreation/wild/quotas.shtml\"&gt;use quotas&lt;/a&gt; are in effect from May 1 to November 1.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Bishop Pass Trail starts from the parking lot of South Lake (9,000 feet).  It is a very busy place with limited overnight parking.  An overflow lot is 1.5 miles back down the road.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;After about 5 miles on a broad, well-traveled trail, many steep switchbacks lead to the summit plateau of Bishop Pass (11,960 feet) and the entrance to King\'s Canyon National Park and the wilderness boundary.  Follow the trail, then eventually wander cross-country down into Dusy Basin (~11,380 feet).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Another option is to cross Bishop Pass heading towards Dusy Basin.  About 200 feet below Bishop Pass, head left and hike cross-country.  Contour around Mount Agassiz and Mount Winchell.  Cross Thunderbolt Pass into Palisade Basin, which has good areas for camping.  After contouring around Peak 12,548, head towards Isosceles Pass; it separates Isosceles Peak from Columbine Peak and Columbine\'s Northeast Ridge (which is a pleasant, class 2-3 climb over stable talus and boulders).  Isosceles is NNE of Columbine; they share a ridgeline. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Isosceles Pass (12,080 feet) is 0.1 mile south of Isosceles Peak and is an alternative to Knapsack Pass.  The Dusy Basin side is rated class 3; the Barrett Lakes side is class 2.   Secor states that Knapsack Pass is easier than Isosceles Pass. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The indolent climber can hire pack animals to haul gear up into the area, but pack animals are not allowed to stay overnight in Dusy Basin.  &lt;a href=\"http://www.summitpost.com/mountains/user_link.pl?user_id=370\"&gt;Bob Burd&lt;/a&gt; helpfully clarifies:  \"This includes the national park as well. Pack mules are considered \'traditional use\' along with horses in Wilderness areas, and can be used on most trails.  &lt;a href=\"http://www.summitpost.com/mountains/user_link.pl/user_id/5493\"&gt;Craig Peer\'s&lt;/a&gt; recent trip into Dusy Basin is such an example.\" &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_3\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Red Tape&lt;/h2&gt;A &lt;a href=\"http://www.fs.fed.us/r5/inyo/recreation/wild/otheravail.shtml\"&gt;quota system&lt;/a&gt; for both Bishop Pass and the North Fork of Big Pine Creek is in effect from May 1 to November 1.  Permits can be obtained from the ranger stations in Lee Vining, Bishop, or Lone Pine.  &lt;a href=\"http://www.fs.fed.us/r5/inyo/recreation/wild/permitsres.shtml\"&gt;Permit applications&lt;/a&gt; may also be done via mail or fax.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Overnight permits are required to access the backcountry at all times. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Advance reservations are *highly* recommended, especially for Bishop Pass: it is one of the most popular trails in the High Sierra.  The &lt;a href=\"http://www.fs.fed.us/r5/inyo/\"&gt;Inyo National Forest&lt;/a&gt; website has &lt;a href=\"http://www.fs.fed.us/r5/inyo/recreation/wild/index.shtml\"&gt; wilderness info&lt;/a&gt; including &lt;a href=\"http://www.fs.fed.us/r5/inyo/recreation/wild/otheravail.shtml\"&gt;quotas, reservation availability&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"http://www.fs.fed.us/r5/inyo/recreation/wild/permitsres.shtml\"&gt;permit applications.&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Wood campfires are not permitted in Dusy Basin (or anywhere above 10,000 feet in King\'s Canyon National Park).  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_4\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;When To Climb&lt;/h2&gt;Isosceles can be climbed any time of year...but of course, summer is the easiest.  During late summers snow may still be near the base but ice axes are not needed. &lt;br&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_5\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Camping&lt;/h2&gt;Dusy Basin offers a number of excellent campsites.  One option includes the flat perimeter somewhat near the sandy shores of the various lakes.  Large boulders nearby are good for food storage, and also serve as after-dinner bouldering problems. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Campsites are also available on the southeast side of Isosceles, in Palisade Basin. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Mosquitos are vicious!  Don\'t forget the DEET!  During mosquito season a hat with netting down to the shoulders and a netting shirt are priceless commodities.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Water is not a problem, even in late season: it can be obtained from the various lakes, or from the streams that feed them.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There are no huts.&lt;br&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_6\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Route Overviews&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Southwest Face&lt;/b&gt; (class 5)&lt;br&gt;First ascent July 1939.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Southwest Buttress&lt;/b&gt; (II, 5.6)&lt;br&gt;First ascent 19 August 1995.

While this should be a popular alternative it is often over looked by those intent on the big one to the north-east. The views from this scramble are well worth the 4-5 hour effort. Eiffel Tower, Paradise Valley, The Valley of the Ten Peaks, Mount Temple, The Mitre, are just a few of surrounding peaks and valleys that you have good view of from the summit. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A 70 m pillar just behind it to the west called Eiffel tower is a challenging rock climb. This tower section was first climbed in 1951 and according to &lt;i&gt;Alan Kane&rsquo;s Scrambles in the Canadian Rockies&lt;/i&gt; was climbed again in 1952 and since then largely ignored.&lt;br&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_2\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Getting There&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;div align=\"center\" class=\"image-left\" style=\"width: 206px;\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"/eiffel-peak-on-the-ascent/128143\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Eiffel Peak on the ascent...\" height=\"150\" width=\"200\" src=\"/images/small/128143.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=\"caption\"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;You will have to get yourself to Lake Louise. From Calgary take the Trans Canada (1) west through Canmore, Banff to Lake Louise then take the road to Moraine Lake. Note you should get there early as the parking lot is not very large and tends to fill up early. The trail head is found 100 yards along the lake to the right. Follow the obvious trail up the switchbacks up to Larch Valley. Then once you have passed the trees at the point where you will find two benches, turn left away from the crowd that is headed to Sentinal pass and Temple and decend to a small rocky stream and ascend the skyline ridge. Follow the ridge along broken rocks and scree till you find an obvious trail the at winds its way to the summit. There are a couple of rock bands but nothing in the way of great difficulty. This is an excellent half day of hiking/scrambling.&lt;br&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_3\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Red Tape&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;div align=\"center\" class=\"image-left\" style=\"width: 156px;\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"/eiffel-tower-from-the-summit/28063\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Eiffel Tower from the summit...\" height=\"200\" width=\"150\" src=\"/images/small/28063.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=\"caption\"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;Image above is Eiffel Tower which is found just to the north behind the summit of Eiffel peak.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;You will need a Parks pass. This can be picked up as you enter the Park on the highway near Banff. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Rates for Parks Canada as of July 1, 2005:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Wilderness Backcountry: $9/night&lt;br&gt;Wilderness Pass: $63/year&lt;br&gt;Reservation Fee:  $12/group&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Park Entry:&lt;br&gt;$16/group/day&lt;br&gt;$109/year&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;One other item of note. Due to bear activity, to go up from the parking lot to the point where you head left towards Eiffel. You now have to travel in groupes of 6 or more. Wait at the trail head for the correct amount of people and then proceed as a group. You have to do the same at the benches upon your return. This may seen like a hassle but there are so many people that groups are formed easily and everyone is aware of the rule. One thing is try and ensure that everone is of the approximate level of speed and fitness as the groups will break up on the way up or down and you could be hassled or even fined by the park personal.&lt;br&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_4\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;When To Climb&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;div align=\"center\" class=\"image-left\" style=\"width: 206px;\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"/eiffel-peak-from-midway-up/67906\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Eiffel Peak from midway up...\" height=\"150\" width=\"200\" src=\"/images/small/67906.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=\"caption\"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;The summer months are the most popular.

But there are many campsites in the Lake Louise area. One place that is recommended is the ACC/Hostel in Lake Louise. This place has a small cosy restaurent with good food as well as kitchen facilities and lots of room for approx 36$ Canadian a night. While this is twice as much as the ACC lodge in Canmore it is still a bargin when compaired to the cost of hotels in the area.&lt;br&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_6\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Mountain Conditions&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;div align=\"center\" class=\"image-left\" style=\"width: 206px;\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"/william-marler-right-and/27831\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"William Marler (right) and...\" height=\"150\" width=\"200\" src=\"/images/small/27831.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=\"caption\"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;Check with the Rangers in Lake Louise. You can sign in and out (probably wise to do so.. but remember to sign out!) Beware of the the weather conditions and dress accordingly. If the weather turns trails can ice up and people can get into trouble because they went up in nice weather then the slabs and scree iced up in the snow or rain and made the route very dicy for the decent. Excellent conditioning hike.&lt;br&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_7\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Lake Louise information&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;div align=\"center\" class=\"image-left\" style=\"width: 206px;\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"/eiffel-tower/332302\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Eiffel Tower\" height=\"133\" width=\"200\" src=\"/images/small/332302.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=\"caption\"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;Try this for activities in the area&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://www.banfflakelouise.com\"&gt;Banff Lake Louise Tourist Bureau&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Joining a club such as The Alpine Club of Canada is recommended when climbing in Canada. While it is not obligatory, useful information can be had at any of their main Clubhouse in Canmore, or at their website which is open to everyone.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://www.alpineclubofcanada.ca/\"&gt;http://www.alpineclubofcanada.ca/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Staying at the club in Canmore is 15$ Canadian for members and 19$ for non-members. It can get quite crowded in the summer so a reservation is recommended. Staying at the hostel in Lake Louise is more at 36$ Canadian but is good value for the money.&lt;br&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_8\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Images&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div align=\"center\"&gt;&lt;table id=\"my_images\"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/moraine-lake-at-dusk/766164/c-151866\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Moraine Lake At Dusk\" src=\"/images/square/766164.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/mount-hungabee/766173/c-151866\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Mount Hungabee\" src=\"/images/square/766173.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/eiffel-tower-from-the-summit/28063/c-151866\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Eiffel Tower from the summit...\" src=\"/images/square/28063.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/eiffel-peak-from-the-top-of/67905/c-151866\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Eiffel Peak from the top of...\" src=\"/images/square/67905.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/eiffel-tower-from-the-summit/30358/c-151866\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Eiffel Tower from the summit...\" src=\"/images/square/30358.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/mount-temple-from-the-summit/28792/c-151866\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Mount Temple from the summit...\" src=\"/images/square/28792.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/the-normal-route-up-eiffel/79361/c-151866\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"The Normal route up Eiffel...\" src=\"/images/square/79361.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/deltaform-north-face/766273/c-151866\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Deltaform North Face\" src=\"/images/square/766273.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/eiffel-tower/332302/c-151866\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Eiffel Tower\" src=\"/images/square/332302.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/eiffel-peak-from-the-end-of/27830/c-151866\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Eiffel peak from the end of...\" src=\"/images/square/27830.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/the-southeast-ridge-of-eiffel-peak/471713/c-151866\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"The Southeast Ridge of Eiffel Peak\" src=\"/images/square/471713.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/the-end-of-paradise-valley/28458/c-151866\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"The end of Paradise Valley...\" src=\"/images/square/28458.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/mount-fay/766274/c-151866\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Mount Fay\" src=\"/images/square/766274.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/neptuak-peak-and-eiffel-peak/374567/c-151866\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Neptuak Peak and Eiffel Peak\" src=\"/images/square/374567.JPG\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td colspan=\"7\" align=\"center\"&gt;[ &lt;a href=\"/eiffel-peak/images/p-151866\"&gt;View Gallery - 38 More Images&lt;/a&gt; ]&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/article&gt;date:difficulty:'),(100,151893,'/simmons-peak/151893','/yosemite-national-park/171226','Simmons Peak','','','','12497','',12707,37.7606,-119.294,'California, United States, North America','','',171226,'Yosemite National Park','','','','','','Mountain-Rock','content: &lt;article&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_1\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2 id=\"first_h2\"&gt;Overview&lt;/h2&gt;Simmons Peak is a seldom visited yet rugged and remote mountain a few miles north of popular Mount Lyell in southeastern Yosemite National Park.  Though Simmons Peak ranks as the &lt;a href=\"http://www.summitpost.org/yosemite-s-highest-peaks/742800\"&gt;twelfth highest in Yosemite&lt;/a&gt;, it is often overlooked in part due to its absence from the Sierra Club&rsquo;s Sierra Peaks Section SPS List.  Despite its relative obscurity, visitors to the peak will be amply rewarded with outstanding views from both the summit and throughout the approaches.  Lewis Creek Basin and Ireland Lake are especially recommended as possible stopover locations en route to the summit.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Approaches to the summit include at least 24 miles round-trip with 4,000 feet of elevation gain.  Route options can be selected to match most visitors&rsquo; preferences, ranging from the class 2 southwest and southeast slopes to the class 5.8 east ar&ecirc;te.  Many itineraries, especially those covering multiple days, also include peaks like Amelia Earhart Peak, &lt;a href=\"http://www.summitpost.org/parsons-peak/154592\"&gt;Parsons Peak&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"http://www.summitpost.org/mount-florence/650446\"&gt;Mount Florence&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"http://www.summitpost.org/vogelsang-peak/151700\"&gt;Vogelsang Peak&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href=\"http://www.summitpost.org/fletcher-peak/151703\"&gt;Fletcher Peak&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;noformat&gt; &lt;table class=\"inline_image_thumbs\"&gt; &lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=79787\" rel=\"nofollow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/79787.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=533394\" rel=\"nofollow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/533394.JPG\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=314854\" rel=\"nofollow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/314854.JPG\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=191783\" rel=\"nofollow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/191783.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=59923\" rel=\"nofollow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/59923.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=59897\" rel=\"nofollow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/59897.JPG\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/noformat&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_2\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Getting There&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;div align=\"center\" class=\"image-right\" style=\"width: 121px;\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"/mount-florence-and-simmons-peak-route-map/650411\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Mount Florence and Simmons Peak Route Map\" height=\"200\" width=\"115\" src=\"/images/small/650411.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=\"caption\"&gt;Route Map&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div align=\"center\" class=\"image-left\" style=\"width: 206px;\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"/grassy-trail/773109\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Grassy Trail\" height=\"150\" width=\"200\" src=\"/images/small/773109.JPG\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=\"caption\"&gt;Ireland Lake Trail&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br&gt;The shortest and usual route options for Simmons Peak begin at the southbound John Muir Trail Trailhead near Tuolumne Meadows in Yosemite National Park.  Depending on your selection, your path will either continue through Lyell Canyon or follow Rafferty Creek towards Vogelsang.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Lyell Canyon/Rafferty Creek&lt;/b&gt; (37.87790&deg; N, 119.33873&deg; W)&lt;br&gt;From either the east or the west, follow Highway 120 into Yosemite National Park until reaching Tuolumne Meadows Lodge Road near Lembert Dome (6 miles west of Tioga Pass and 0.5 miles east of Tuolumne Meadows Campground).  Signs here mark the location of the wilderness permit ranger station.  You can either park at the ranger station, or continue down the road another 0.4 miles to the large trailhead parking area on the left.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Bears frequently visit the parking areas, so use the bear boxes to store any food. Park rangers are also known to prowl at night looking for improperly stored food or irritating campers asleep in their vehicles.&lt;br clear=\"ALL\"&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_3\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Routes&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;div align=\"center\" class=\"image-right\" style=\"width: 381px;\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"/simmons-peak-from-vogelsang-pass/191776\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Simmons Peak from Vogelsang Pass\" height=\"500\" width=\"375\" src=\"/images/medium/191776.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=\"caption\"&gt;Simmons Peak from Vogelsang Pass&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br&gt;There are several options available for approach and route combinations to the summit of Simmons Peak, just a few possibilities are outlined below.  Routes via Lewis Creek Basin are highly recommended for both their outstanding scenery and almost guaranteed seclusion.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Southwest Slope via Vogelsang Pass and Lewis Creek&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;12.1 miles one-way, 4400 feet elevation gain out plus 600 feet on the return&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;Follow the John Muir Trail south from the parking area 1.5 miles to the Rafferty Creek Trail junction and turn south (right) towards Vogelsang. The trail gains elevation gradually to Tuolumne Pass, past Vogelsang High Sierra Camp (the cause of the copious quantities of horse manure covering the path), and over Vogelsang Pass.  the trail approximately one mile earlier, about 400 feet below south side of the pass (as soon as a traverse towards Gallison Lake and Lewis Creek becomes feasible). Gallison Lake has excellent camping options and views of Simmons Peak. Continue cross-country to the head of the basin and climb the west ridge or southwest slope.  The west ridge has a few moves as high as class 4 (which can be bypassed to the south).  Some parties have complained about the loose talus on the class 2 southwest slope, but if you keep to the right (closer to the south ridge) the rock is more solid and even makes for a nice scramble.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Southwest Slope via Ireland Lake&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;13.2 miles one-way, 4500 feet elevation gain out plus 700 feet on the return&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;An approach via Ireland Lake is a good option if climbing nearby Parsons Peak or Amelia Earhart Peak. Instead of turning south towards Vogelsang at the Rafferty Creek Trail junction, continue straight through Lyell Canyon until reaching the Ireland Lake junction 6 miles from the trailhead. Follow the trail another 4 miles to Ireland Lake, a fantastic grassy area with excellent views of the surrounding peaks. Head south around the lake&rsquo;s east shore towards the pass southeast of Parsons Peak, then into Lewis Creek Basin and joining the west ridge or southwest slope routes described above.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;North Ridge via Ireland Lake&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;12.2 miles one-way, 4100 feet elevation gain out plus 300 feet on the return&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;Another option to Simmons Peak from Ireland Lake is via the class 4 north ridge, which is an especially convenient option if also climbing Amelia Earhart Peak.  See the &lt;a href=\"http://www.summitpost.org/north-ridge/163082\"&gt;North Ridge&lt;/a&gt; page for complete details.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;East Slope via Maclure Creek&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;12.0 miles one-way, 3900 feet elevation gain out plus 100 feet on the return&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;This approach is less frequently used than the others due to the long walk through Lyell Canyon, but is the best option if climbing the east ar&ecirc;te (Grade III, 5.8) or also visiting Mount Maclure or Mount Lyell on the same trip. Leave Tuolumne Meadows and follow Lyell Canyon south for 10 miles to the footbridge crossing the Lyell Fork. Before crossing the footbridge continue following Maclure Creek southwest towards two unnamed lakes and then the class 2 southeast slope or the east ar&ecirc;te.&lt;br clear=\"ALL\"&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_4\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Red Tape&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;div align=\"center\" class=\"image-right\" style=\"width: 506px;\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"/dawn-on-simmons-peak/772666\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Dawn on Simmons Peak\" height=\"375\" width=\"500\" src=\"/images/medium/772666.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=\"caption\"&gt;Dawn on Simmons Peak&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Entrance Fees:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Access to Simmons Peak lies in Yosemite National Park and an entrance fee is required.

After hours pickup is not available, and if arriving in the morning expect to wait in line 1 &frac12; to 2 hours even with a reservation.  Permits can be picked up at the Tuolumne Meadows Wilderness Center near the trailhead during open hours.  This is one of the most popular trailheads in Yosemite, and subject to &lt;a href=\"http://www.nps.gov/yose/planyourvisit/trailheads.htm\"&gt;quotas&lt;/a&gt;, so if seeking a permit reservations far in advance are highly recommended.    Check the &lt;a href=\"http://www.nps.gov/yose/planyourvisit/wildpermits.htm\"&gt;Yosemite permit page&lt;/a&gt; for full details on hours, the reservation process, and reservation availability.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Food Storage:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Bear canisters are required throughout Yosemite National Park.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Campfires:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Fires are prohibited above 9,600 feet.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Yosemite National Park Wilderness Permit Office&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;PO Box 545&lt;br&gt;Yosemite, CA 95389&lt;br&gt;Phone: (209) 372-0740 &lt;br&gt;Fax: (209) 372-0739&lt;br clear=\"ALL\"&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_5\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;When To Climb&lt;/h2&gt;Tioga pass is not plowed in the winter, and overnight parking is not permitted after October 15.

Excellent options include Lewis Creek Basin, Maclure Creek, and Ireland Lake among many others.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Roadside camping is not permitted in Yosemite.  Established &lt;a href=\"http://www.nps.gov/yose/planyourvisit/tmcamp.htm\"&gt;Tuolumne Meadows Campground&lt;/a&gt; in Yosemite has just over 300 sites and is within walking distance of the trailhead.  Reservations are recommended, though half of the sites are first-come, first-serve.  There is also a walk-in backpackers&rsquo; camping area within the campground.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Inyo National Forest hosts a few first-come, first-serve campgrounds just east of the park near Tioga pass, and more numerous sites in Lee Vining Canyon.  Those near Tioga pass tend to fill up quickly.

The La Sals are the second highest mountain range in Utah, second only to the Uinta Mountains. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The La Sals are laccoliths. Magma rose under sedimentary layers, intruding into sandstone and shale layers, but did not break the surface as in a volcanic eruption.  Successive intrusions developed overlapping laccolithic blisters. The intrusions lifted the overlying sediments as much as 6,000\'. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;USGS Quad 24k, Mount Peale, Quad # = o38109-d2 &lt;br&gt;USGS Quad 100k, La Sal, Quad # = f38109-a1 &lt;br&gt;USGS Quad 250k, Moab, Quad # c38108-a1 &lt;br&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_2\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Getting There&lt;/h2&gt;Moab ~ La Sal Pass&lt;br&gt;From Moab, UT drive 21.8 miles south on Utah highway 191 to the junction of Utah Highway 46 at La Sal Junction. Turn east (left) onto Utah 46, pass through the small town of La Sal, and drive 12.8 miles to the signed, gravel road stating, \"La Sal Pass.\" Turn left onto this graded gravel road. Drive 2 miles and turn left (west) onto the La Sal Pass Road at a marked junction. Drive another 7.4 miles to La Sal Pass at 10,125 feet. Most 2WD vehictes will make it to this point, however, in late spring there is a creek crossing that may present a challenge during high run-off periods. There are a couple of possible starting points for Mt. Peale. One is to drive all the way to La Sal Pass near Medicine Lake and park. The other, is to park at the drainage just past the turnoff to Beaver Lake. Both options are viable and the difference in distance is negligable. Alternatively, La Sal Pass can be approached from the west side, but 4WD and high clearance is required.  (copied from the Peale Page, I found the Peale description to be accurate)&lt;br&gt;The turn off after Beaver Lake is approximaety .50 of a mile before the La Sal Pass trailhead and would the the last right hand turn within that distance.&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;table class=\"inline_image_thumbs\"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=30329\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/30329.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_3\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Red Tape&lt;/h2&gt;Mount Mellenthin is in the Manti-La Sal National Forest.

John Veranth\'s &lt;i&gt;\"Hiking the Wasatch\"&lt;/i&gt; only mentions the peak as part of the Bullion Divide ridgerun. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Red Baldy sits on the Alpine Ridge seperating Little Cottonwood and American Fork Canyons in the &lt;a href=\"http://www.fs.fed.us/r4/wcnf/\"&gt;Wasatch-Cache National Forest&lt;/a&gt;.   At 11,171 feet it is among the highest peaks in the Wasatch, but it sits between the higher &lt;a href=\"http://www.summitpost.org/show/mountain_link.pl/mountain_id/2103\"&gt;American Fork Twin Peaks&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"http://www.summitpost.org/show/mountain_link.pl/mountain_id/2209\"&gt;White Baldy&lt;/a&gt;, thus, it sees relatively few ascents. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Red Baldy is most commonly climbed from White Pine Canyon in Little Cottonwood via a number of routes, but it can also be climbed from the south by hiking to Silver Glance Lake, then routefinding up to \"West Pass\" between Red and White Baldy, and finishing via the west ridge.  Red Baldy is also one of multiple summits often climbed by advanced hikers as part of the &lt;a href=\"http://www.summitpost.org/show/route_link.pl/route_id/4803/object_id/3428\"&gt;Bullion Divide&lt;/a&gt; ridgerun.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;USGS Quads:&lt;ul type=\"square\"&gt;&lt;li&gt;Dromedary Peak, Utah (1:24,000) &lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; Salt Lake City, Utah (1:100,000) &lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;table class=\"inline_image_thumbs\"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=31045\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/31045.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=113120\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/113120.JPG\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=31047\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/31047.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=31049\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/31049.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=83693\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/83693.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_2\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Getting There&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Trailhead:&lt;/b&gt;  &lt;font color=\"blue\"&gt;&lt;b&gt;White Pine&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt;  - &lt;b&gt;X,XXX\'&lt;/b&gt;  &lt;br&gt;Take the 6200 South exit (exit #6) off I-215 and follow highway 190 south-east approximately 2 miles to the intersection with Big Cottonwood Canyon road. Continue straight through the stoplight and follow the road another 4 miles to the mouth of Little Cottonwood Canyon, where an electronic billboard on the right provides current road and/or weather conditions. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Drive about 2/3 of the way up Little Cottonwood Canyon, approximately 30 min from Salt Lake City. There are signs marking the turnoff on the south side of the road for the trailhead parking lot.

The first I noticed were a large quantity of burrows (trace fossils) right after the first scramble. Later on there is a formation with Rugose Corals and Crinoid stems. All the formations intersect the route, so you don\'t have to leave the ridge to see them.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Also, as tempting as it may be to collect them, please leave them where they are so others can enjoy them (at least the ones on the ridge). They are in a hard limestone and getting them out would be painstaking and likely destroy them anyways. If you really want some, take the effort to go off-route a ways.&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td valign=\"bottom\" style=\"padding-top: 6px;\" colspan=\"2\"&gt;&lt;span style=\"font-size: 9px; color: #888;\"&gt;Posted Aug 22, 2012 8:46 pm&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;table border=\"0\" width=\"775\"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;table cellpadding=\"2\" cellspacing=\"2\" width=\"100%\"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;&lt;span class=\"pagertext\"&gt;Viewing: &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;-&lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt; of &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td align=\"center\"&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td align=\"right\"&gt;    &lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_9\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Images&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div align=\"center\"&gt;&lt;table id=\"my_images\"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/another-beautiful-wasatch-sunset-they-say-it-is-the-pollution-that-gives-us-such-beautiful-sunsets-get-shorty/584771/c-151974\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\'Another beautiful Wasatch sunset....\"They say it is the pollution that gives us such beautiful sunsets\"-Get Shorty-\' src=\"/images/square/584771.JPG\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/mount-raymond/773576/c-151974\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Mount Raymond \" src=\"/images/square/773576.JPG\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/some-point-release-avalanches-on-mt-raymond/601694/c-151974\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Some point release avalanches on Mt Raymond\" src=\"/images/square/601694.JPG\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/mount-raymond/525339/c-151974\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Mount Raymond\" src=\"/images/square/525339.JPG\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/gobblers-knob-raymond/407643/c-151974\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Gobblers Knob &amp;amp; Raymond\" src=\"/images/square/407643.JPG\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/mount-raymond/526003/c-151974\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Mount Raymond\" src=\"/images/square/526003.JPG\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/mt-raymond-at-200mm/600658/c-151974\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Mt.

At 13,565 feet, the peak is overshadowed by its higher neighbours to the south, Mts. &lt;a href=\"http://www.summitpost.org/show/mountain_link.pl/mountain_id/383\"&gt;Russell&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"http://www.summitpost.org/show/mountain_link.pl/mountain_id/45\"&gt;Whitney&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"http://www.summitpost.org/show/mountain_link.pl/mountain_id/359\"&gt;Muir&lt;/a&gt;.  Tunnabora\'s relatively diminutive stature in comparison to these 14ers, in combination with what could charitably be described as less than classic climbing (some trip reports have given it the rather pejorative appellation of &lt;i&gt;Tunnaboring&lt;/i&gt;), means the peak is infrequently climbed.  But those few who do make it up here are treated to excellent views that compensate for the poor climbing.  To the south, one looks over unusual Tulainyo Lake, one of the &lt;a href=\"http://www.highestlake.com/highest-lake-usa.html\"&gt;highest lakes&lt;/a&gt; in the continental United States, to Mt. Russell\'s impressive North Ridge.  To the north lies the immense &lt;a href=\"http://www.summitpost.org/show/mountain_link.pl/mountain_id/297\"&gt;Mt. Williamson&lt;/a&gt; and Vacation Pass.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Tunnabora is perhaps best climbed in combination with some of the aforementioned peaks.  A loop of Carillon, Tunnabora, Russell, Whitney, and Muir can be done out of Whitney Portal as a reasonable dayhike--the scenery is grand, the scrambling excellent on Russell, Whitney, and Muir, and the loop knocks off five &lt;a href=\"http://angeles.sierraclub.org/peaks/sps/spslist.htm\"&gt;SPS peaks&lt;/a&gt; in one day.  Fun!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The usual route up Tunnabora Peak is a fairly tedious slog up its sandy south slopes from Tulainyo Lake (class 1).  Keeping to the left may offer marginally more solid footing, but don\'t expect a great climb whichever way you go.  Another option is offered by a chute on the northwest face, which is class 2 from George Creek.&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;table class=\"inline_image_thumbs\"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=134600\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/134600.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=76401\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/76401.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=31083\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/31083.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=31834\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/31834.JPG\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_2\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Getting There&lt;/h2&gt;The peak is most easily approached out of Whitney Portal.  From Lone Pine, follow Whitney Portal Road for thirteen miles to the abundant parking at the road\'s end (elevation 8,365 feet).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;From Whitney Portal, hike up the North Fork of Lone Pine Creek and hike over Russell-Carillon Col (class 2-3) to Tulainyo Lake.  Russell-Carillon Col is also the approach to Mt. Russell\'s East Ridge; follow the &lt;a href=\"http://www.summitpost.org/show/route_link.pl/route_id/923/object_id/383#approach\"&gt;approach directions&lt;/a&gt; for that climb to reach the pass.  The north side of the col consists of steep ledges and talus; angle slightly to the right on the descent for easier terrain.  Tulainyo Lake is passed on its west side.  The peak is an easy climb from here.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Cleaver Col (class 3) offers an alternative approach to Tulainyo Lake from Whitney Portal; the pass is located 0.2mi NE of Mt. Carillon.  It is lower elevation than Russell-Carillon Col, and may offer more solid footing than the sand slog that\'s found on the south side of the latter pass.  Tulainyo Lake may also be reached via an easy hike from the Pacific Crest Trail through the Wallace/Wales Lakes basin.&lt;br&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_3\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Red Tape&lt;/h2&gt;Tunnabora Peak is located outside the Whitney Zone.  No permits are required for dayhikes.  A wilderness permit is required for overnight visits; contact &lt;a href=\"http://www.fs.fed.us/r5/inyo/contactus/index.html\"&gt;Inyo National Forest&lt;/a&gt; for details.&lt;br&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_4\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;When To Climb&lt;/h2&gt;Given the relatively short approach out of Whitney Portal, Tunnabora can be climbed year-round, although dayhikes are likely only a reasonable option in the summer months (typically May through October).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;An early season snow climb would be preferable to the sand slog found in later season.  If you choose this option, May would likely offer the best climbing, as the southern exposure of the standard route would cause it to melt out early.&lt;br&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_5\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Mountain Conditions&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://www.fs.fed.us/r5/inyo/currentconditions/index.html\"&gt;Eastern Sierra&lt;/a&gt; Road &amp;amp; Trail conditions, plus &lt;a href=\"http://www.fs.fed.us/r5/inyo/recreation/permits_res.html\"&gt;permit information&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;MOUNT WHITNEY RANGER STATION&lt;br&gt;640 S.

Latitude 51;24;00-Longitude 116;13;20.  It was first ascended by Samuel E.S. Allen in 1893.  It is probably one of the easiest scramble in Banff National Park.  It is a part of the Canadian Rocky Mountains and the Bow river Valley.  This hike will give you one of the best view in the Rockies.  This is mostly a long hike (5-7 hours round trip).  Strong hikers will complete the trip in less then 5 hours.  The route to the top is Class 1.  The first part of the hike is mostly in the forest.  But, once you reach the Saddleback, the view of the surrrounding peaks is wonderful.  There is a big cairn marking the top of Mount Fairview.  Once on top, you will have a beautiful view of Lake Louise (more than one vertical km below!) , mount St-Piran, Niblock , Whyte, Victoria and many others.  This is a very popular hike in the Lake Louise area.  The most popular route is the Saddleback.  You can easily add saddle Mountain to this hike with little extra effort.  The trail to mount Fairview can be crowded in summer.  September is a good climbing month to avoid the crowds and see the beautiful larch colors!  My first hike of Mount Fairview was under snowy conditions.  This reduced the visibility but even in these conditions, it was a magnificent day.  This makes nice photos!  Remember that you are in grizzly country, please carry bear spray for your safety.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I would suggest you to look at \"SCRAMBLES in the Canadian Rockies\" from Alan Kane or \" The World of Lake Louise\" from Don Beers for even more details.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;table class=\"inline_image_thumbs\"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=33381\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/33381.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=142938\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/142938.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=70795\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/70795.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=89528\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/89528.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=126552\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/126552.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_2\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Getting There&lt;/h2&gt;Once at Lake Louise townsite, just follow the road to the Chateau Lake Louise parking area.  The trail to the Saddleback begins at the end of the parking lot near the boat house.  From there, it\'s 3.7 km to the Saddleback.  Saddleback to summit is 1.3 km.  The last km to the summit is much steeper.  Just follow the cairns to the summit.  The north face of mount Fairview is very steep, do not attempt to descend this way.&lt;br&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_3\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Red Tape&lt;/h2&gt;Your in Banff National Park so be sure to have a Park Pass.  Park Passes can be purchased at the East Park Gates as you enter the park or at any other gate.  Backcountry Wilderness Passes can be bought at the Banff Information Center on Banff Ave.  The parking is free.&lt;br&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_4\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;When To Climb&lt;/h2&gt;You can climb mount Fairview from June trough October.  September is a beautiful time to climb it since it is less crowded and you will see the beautiful autumn colors.  Winter ascent are possible but for more experienced climbers.&lt;br&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_5\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Camping&lt;/h2&gt;There is a camping at Lake Louise townsite.  It is open year round.  It\'s a nice and quiet place to stay.  Electricity and water are available on each site.

But this broad expanse of summit is buttressed by long, sweeping, steep north and south faces that provide excellent year-round climbing in the spectacular heart of Rocky Mountain National Park.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;According to the book &lt;em&gt;High Country Names&lt;/em&gt; by Louisa Arps and Elinor Kingery, the peak was called Table Top Mountain in 1887 when W.L. Hallett guided Frederick Chapin to its summit. (Those familiar with RMNP mountains will recognize both of those names). The name Flattop was given sometime later but the authors don\'t mention when or by whom.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The first ascent must be considered unrecorded, as Ute and Arapahoe Indians used a trail over Flattop to cross the Continental Divide for hundreds of years. (Source: &lt;em&gt;Rocky Mountain National Park - A History&lt;/em&gt; by C.W. Buchholtz)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The routes I will add to this page are all snow climbs. I know there are some good rock routes on the south face, so please feel free to provide information about these. The mountain is ideally situated to make any outing a circuit, with little or no backtracking. Descent routes can use the standard trail, Tyndall or Andrews Glaciers.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;table class=\"inline_image_thumbs\"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=37252\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/37252.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=37443\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/37443.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=46524\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/46524.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=37863\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/37863.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=51730\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/51730.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_2\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Getting There&lt;/h2&gt;There are three typical options for approaching Flattop, depending upon your climbing destination. All three start at Bear Lake (9.475\'). This is one of the main roads in the Park. Take the first left turn after the Beaver Meadows entrance and follow the road to its end. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The trail options to Flattop are:&lt;br&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;The &lt;b&gt;standard hiking trail&lt;/b&gt; begins by bearing right (north) at Bear Lake. Shortly, a sharp right turn puts you on the Bierstadt / Flattop Mountain Trail. After a half mile turn left onto the Flattop / Lake Helene trail. Yet another half mile, another trail junction, and another left turn puts you on the trail to Flattop. The route to the summit is all easy on-trail walking.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Recommended winter variation:&lt;/b&gt; After the final left turn mentioned above the summer hiking trail winds through thick wood for well over a mile. After a fresh winter snowfall following this trail is difficult, at least for my poor navigation skills. I have used the following variation with success on numerous occasions on both skis and snowshoes. Instead of turning left at the above mentioned junction, continue straight towards Lake Helene. In less than 1/2 mile you will pass a prominent rock outcrop on your left. This is marked as point 10708 on the McHenry\'s Peak Quadrangle. Once this outcrop is behind you, turn left and now facing southwest, begin climbing the slope. The trees are thin here, choose the path of least resistance. In several hundred yards you &lt;a href=\"http://www.summitpost.com/mountains/photo_link.pl?photo_id=85866&amp;amp;object_id=2614&amp;amp;type=mountain&amp;amp;mountain_id=2614&amp;amp;route_id=\"&gt;break out of the trees&lt;/a&gt; and the way ahead should be clear. By keeping the rocks close to your left you should be out of any slide danger from the broad expanse of slopes to your right.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;li&gt;If you are climbing the &lt;b&gt;North Face Couloirs, Northwest Gully, or Ptarmigan Snowfield&lt;/b&gt; then follow the above directions, but continue straight on to Lake Helene. You will begin to see the dramatic form of Notchtop Mountain ahead of you. Near Lake Helene look for one of several beaten paths on the left side of the trail. If you make a sharp turn to the right (northeast) toward Odessa Lake, then you went too far. These side tracks lead to the North Face of Flattop. In winter it is a question of choosing the best looking route. The views of Notchtop on your right are spectacular. It is about 4 miles from the trailhead to the base of the climbs.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;li&gt;If you are climbing the &lt;b&gt;Dragons Tail, Dragons Tooth&lt;/b&gt; or other south face routes, then turn left (south) from Bear Lake and follow the well marked trail to Emerald Lake. This is probably the most popular tourist hike in the Park and for good reason. It includes four lakes, is easy, and the views are picture-perfect Colorado postcard. The winter trail diverges at Nymph Lake, turning left at the lake and following the stream drainage to Dream Lake. At Emerald Lake you are facing Tyndall Gorge, with the south face of Flattop on your right and the dramatic north face of Hallets Peak on your left. It is less than two miles from Bear to Emerald Lake.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;table class=\"inline_image_thumbs\"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=37254\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/37254.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=37253\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/37253.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=37864\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/37864.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=87535\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/87535.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=44871\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/44871.JPG\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_3\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Descent Options&lt;/h2&gt;Depending on the season and conditions any of the above routes can be combined with an alternate descent route to make for a nice circuit outing. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;You can descend the standard trail, or walk south along the Continental Divide to &lt;a href=\"http://www.summitpost.org/mountains/route_link.pl?route_id=4480&amp;amp;object_id=1845\"&gt;Tyndall Glacier&lt;/a&gt;, or farther south to &lt;a href=\"http://www.summitpost.org/mountains/route_link.pl?route_id=2711&amp;amp;object_id=2689\"&gt;Andrews Glacier&lt;/a&gt;. The latter is easier and can often (but not always!) be done without requiring an ice axe or crampons. It is also a good snowshoe option.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Combing any of the these with an ascent of &lt;a href=\"http://www.summitpost.org/show/mountain_link.pl/mountain_id/1845\"&gt;Hallett Peak&lt;/a&gt; is more icing on the cake!&lt;br&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_4\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Red Tape&lt;/h2&gt;Flattop is within Rocky Mountain National Park, and all Park regulations apply. The &lt;a href=\"http://www.nps.gov/romo/\"&gt;Park\'s web site&lt;/a&gt; will have current rate information. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There are daily as well as annual Park passes. The annual pass is the only way to go for anyone living near the Park. But since you are out climbing and will be entering the Park at an absurdly early hour there will probably be no one there to collect your money.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Please note that &lt;em&gt;no dogs&lt;/em&gt; are permitted on any trail in RMNP, leashed or otherwise.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;table class=\"inline_image_thumbs\"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=85133\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/85133.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=51738\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/51738.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=85134\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/85134.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=51992\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/51992.JPG\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_5\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;When To Climb&lt;/h2&gt;Flattop can be climbed by some route any time of the year.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In summer the major safety concern are the afternoon thunderstorms which can form quickly by noon are a real danger. Avoiding these is why you have entered the park at an absurdly early hour.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In winter you dodge the thunderstorm bullet, but must be prepared for high winds and limited visibility. I have twice been in white out conditions on the featureless slopes of the mountain and was glad to have shot compass readings back to the trail. Avalanches have also &lt;a href=\"http://listsofjohn.com/Accidents/Flattop.html\"&gt;claimed lives&lt;/a&gt; in the couloirs.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;table class=\"inline_image_thumbs\"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=37287\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/37287.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=38977\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/38977.JPG\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=38978\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/38978.JPG\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=44866\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/44866.JPG\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=51739\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/51739.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_6\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Camping&lt;/h2&gt;Backcountry camps require using designated RMNP sites. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There is an unpleasant backcountry site called Sourdough near Lake Helene. It is located in forest far from water and with no views of the nearby beauty. (Views of forests are fine, but if you are surrounded by mountains you\'d prefer to see them from camp.) There is a nicer site at Odessa Lake. It is also possible to bivouac at the base of Notchtop Mountain.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Typically this peak would be climbed as a day trip, but here is the link to &lt;a href=\"http://www.nps.gov/romo/visit/park/camp/info.html\"&gt;RMNP backcountry camping&lt;/a&gt; information.&lt;br&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_7\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Mountain Conditions&lt;/h2&gt;As usual for Colorado, conditions can range from the easiest of walk ups in summer (my wife and I once strolled to the top on a crystal July day after leaving Bear Lake at 1:00 PM), to howling, white-out blizzards in the winter. Or, the other way around!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The biggest weather hazard are the afternoon thunderstorms which can build with alarming speed and danger. These are common from May through September.

From the north Mill Creek Canyon contains approaches of Bowman Fork and Alexander Basin, while from the south Big Cottonwood Canyon contains approaches of Mill B North Fork and Butler Fork.  Two additional appoaches include Porter Fork (Mill Creek Canyon) and Mill D North Fork (Big Cottonwood Canyon), but these approaches are longer and less commonly used.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The most popular trailheads for ascending the peak are as follows:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mill Creek Canyon:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;i&gt;Bowman Fork Trailhead&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;br&gt;From I-215 heading on the east side of Salt Lake Valley, get off on the 3300~3900 South Exit, this will put you on Wasatch Blvd. Follow the BLVD and turn right onto 3800 South, look for signs to Mill Creek Canyon. About 5.3 miles up the canyon you&rsquo;ll come to Terrace Campground on the right. Turn into the campground area and follow (0.2 miles) around to the back to the campground to the Bowman Trailhead. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;i&gt;Alexander Basin Trailhead&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;br&gt;From I-215 heading on the east side of Salt Lake Valley, get off on the 3300~3900 South Exit, this will put you on Wasatch Blvd. Follow the BLVD and turn right onto 3800 South, look for signs to Mill Creek Canyon. About 8.5 miles up the canyon you&rsquo;ll arrive at the Alexander Basin Trailhead, located on the right (south) side of the road.  There is a very small area for parking along the road at the trailhead.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Big Cottonwood Canyon:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;i&gt;Mill B North Fork Trailhead&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;br&gt;From the 6200 South exit off I-215, head east and south on State Highway 190 for &plusmn;2 miles to the intersection with Big Cottonwood Canyon road.  Turn left at the intersection and drive approximately 5 miles east to the \"S\" turn in the road, and park on the right.  The trailhead is located on the left side of the road a short distance to the north of the parking area.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;i&gt;Butler Fork Trailhead&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;br&gt;From the 6200 South exit off I-215, head east and south on State Highway 190 for &plusmn;2 miles to the intersection with Big Cottonwood Canyon road.  Turn left at the intersection and drive approximately 8 miles east to the Butler Fork Trailhead and parking area, located on the left side of the road.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;See the corresponding \'Routes\' sections for details on climbing the peak from each of these trailheads.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;table class=\"inline_image_thumbs\"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=39739\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/39739.JPG\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=39740\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/39740.JPG\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=39486\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/39486.JPG\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=40358\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/40358.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=71192\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/71192.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_3\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Red Tape&lt;/h2&gt;Mill Creek Canyon is a fee area.  A toll booth is located approximately 1.5 miles up the canyon, and collects a fee of $3.00 per vehicle as you &lt;font color=\"red\"&gt;&lt;b&gt;exit&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt; the canyon.  Annual passes may also be purchased for $40.00.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Prior to June 1 each year, a locked gate on Mill Creek Canyon road prevents driving the final 2.4 miles to the Alexander Basin trailhead.  After June 1 the gate remains open until the first significant snowfall of the season.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;No fees are required for approaches from Big Cottonwood Canyon.&lt;br&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_4\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;When To Climb&lt;/h2&gt;Gobblers Knob can be ascended year round.  Dry hiking can usually be found on the mountain by early to mid June, depending on the snowpack, but snow may linger considerably longer on the north facing approaches from Mill Creek Canyon.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Winter months allow for good backcountry skiing on the mountain. Depending on the route and snowpack, gear from basic snowshoes to crampons and ice axe for the various chutes might be required.  There are numerous avalanche slide paths on the mountain; carefully assess snow conditions before considering a winter attempt.&lt;a name=\"chapter_5\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Mountain Conditions&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;National Weather Service &lt;a href=\"http://forecast.weather.gov/MapClick.php?lat=40.672045577994275&amp;amp;lon=-111.68254852294922&amp;amp;site=slc&amp;amp;smap=1&amp;amp;marine=0&amp;amp;unit=0&amp;amp;lg=en\"&gt;forecast &lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Weather &lt;a href=\"http://www.brightonresort.com/Weather\"&gt;forecast and current conditions&lt;/a&gt; for nearby Brighton Ski Resort.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Utah &lt;a href=\"http://utahavalanchecenter.org/\"&gt;Avalanche Center&lt;/a&gt; website.                                          &lt;a name=\"chapter_6\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Images&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div align=\"center\"&gt;&lt;table id=\"my_images\"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/wildflowers-on-the-east-shoulder-of-gobblers-knob/248668/c-152266\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Wildflowers on the east shoulder of Gobblers Knob\" src=\"/images/square/248668.JPG\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/gobblers-knob-raymond/407643/c-152266\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Gobblers Knob &amp;amp; Raymond\" src=\"/images/square/407643.JPG\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/skinning-up-to-the-summit-of-gobblers-knob/590632/c-152266\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Skinning up to the summit of Gobblers Knob\" src=\"/images/square/590632.JPG\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/gobblers-knob/683519/c-152266\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Gobblers Knob\" src=\"/images/square/683519.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/raymond-and-gobbler-s-above-the-morning-fog/484493/c-152266\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Raymond and Gobbler\\\'s above the morning fog\" src=\"/images/square/484493.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/skinning-up-gobblers-knob/590229/c-152266\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Skinning up Gobblers Knob\" src=\"/images/square/590229.JPG\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/jan-2004-a-view-of-gobblers/40357/c-152266\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Jan 2004-A view of Gobblers...\" src=\"/images/square/40357.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view-of-gobblers-knob-from/56768/c-152266\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"View of Gobblers Knob from...\" src=\"/images/square/56768.JPG\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view-from-gobblers-knob/491197/c-152266\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"view from Gobblers Knob\" src=\"/images/square/491197.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/gobblers-knob/522890/c-152266\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Gobblers Knob\" src=\"/images/square/522890.JPG\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/scenery-from-the-mill-b-north/80892/c-152266\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Scenery from the Mill B North...\" src=\"/images/square/80892.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/from-near-the-summit-looking/39738/c-152266\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"From near the summit looking...\" src=\"/images/square/39738.JPG\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/gobblers-knob-and-mt-raymond-from-patsy-marley/528249/c-152266\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Gobblers Knob and Mt Raymond from Patsy Marley\" src=\"/images/square/528249.JPG\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/gobblers-knob-from-grandeur-peak/581347/c-152266\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Gobblers Knob from Grandeur Peak\" src=\"/images/square/581347.JPG\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td colspan=\"7\" align=\"center\"&gt;[ &lt;a href=\"/gobblers-knob/images/p-152266\"&gt;View Gallery - 62 More Images&lt;/a&gt; ]&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/article&gt;date:difficulty:'),(110,152296,'/mount-aire/152296','/wasatch-range-central/171209','Mount Aire','','','','8621','',16583,40.72,-111.695,'Utah, United States, North America','','',171209,'Wasatch Range (Central)','','','','','','Mountain-Rock','content: &lt;article&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_1\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2 id=\"first_h2\"&gt;Overview&lt;/h2&gt;Mt Aire is one of the smaller peaks in the Wasatch, but still a great one to climb nonetheless.  It has excellent panoramic summit views, and it provides some good steep snowshoeing in the winter without worry of avalanche danger. Since the trail is on a shady south slope, it is also a good trail to do in the summer.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The trail from Elbow Fork is 1.75 miles one way from the road with 1,991 feet of elevation gain. In the winter the canyon road is closed at the Maple Cove Picnic Ground, and from there the route is about 3.5  miles long and gains about 2,600 feet.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The peaks along the Millcreek Ridge are a nice set to do for an easy ridge run and the bushwacking isn\'t too bad along the ridgeline compared to the rest of the Wasatch backcountry.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For the advanced hiker, these three summits can be bagged while hiking the &lt;a href=\"http://www.summitpost.org/show/route_link.pl/route_id/4600/object_id/2099\"&gt;Millcreek Ridge&lt;/a&gt; route, which runs from the Salt Lake Valley, over Grandeur Peak, all the way to Murdock Peak.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div align=\"center\" class=\"image\" style=\"width: 381px;\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"/summit-view-of-mt-aire/531230\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Summit view of Mt Aire\" height=\"500\" width=\"375\" src=\"/images/medium/531230.JPG\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=\"caption\"&gt;Looking off the summit of Mount Aire.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_2\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Getting There&lt;/h2&gt;Drive, bike, or walk up East Millcreek Canyon (begins as 3760 South off of Wasatch Boulevard in the valley) to the Elbow Fork Trailhead.

Summer is popular, but some of the climb might be a little warm, so an early start is best.   &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This is a fairly easy and safe climb in winter, but often in the winter there is trailbreaking to be done in order to reach the summit.   Usually there isn\'t much avalanche danger on the route.   &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Fall is very beautiful on the mountain and colors usually peak in late September or early October.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div align=\"center\" class=\"image\" style=\"width: 463px;\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"/climbing-up-mount-aire/521232\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Climbing up Mount Aire\" height=\"500\" width=\"457\" src=\"/images/medium/521232.JPG\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=\"caption\"&gt;Climbing up Mount Aire in the Fall.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_5\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Camping&lt;/h2&gt;Camping is allowed in the Wasatch National Forest anywhere more than 200 ft from any trail and 1/4 mile from any road.

Drive south from Interstate 80 on Wyoming State Route 414 for 6 miles to Mountain View, WY. Route 414 turns west through Mountain View and becomes Route 410 as the road turns south at the west end of town. Drive Route 410 toward Robertson, WY for 6.7 miles to the point where it turns west. From this point, drive Uinta County Road 283 (also named Forest Road 072) south toward Grahams Reservoir and Bridger Lake for 12.1 miles to Forest Road 017. Turn left on Forest Road 017 and continue south 6.8 miles to Forest Road 077. Drive south on Forest Road 077 for 2.8 miles, and turn right on the road to Henrys Fork Campground and the Henrys Fork Trailhead, ca. 8000ft.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Although Gunsight Peak is not mentioned, \'High Uinta Trails\' by Mel Davis and John Veranth provides good information on the approach and accessing the surrounding peaks.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The approach hike is about 8 miles one way and gains 3,000 feet.  Once the lakes are reached, one can ascend via 3 main ways:&lt;br&gt;1. Scramble up the rocky ridgeline along cliffbands above Gunsight Pass&lt;br&gt;2. Sramble up a ridgeline that originates above Dollar Lake. This approach is also common for Gilbert Peak.&lt;br&gt;3. Scramble up a gulley that is located above the last thick patch of trees on the north side of the canyon (ca. 11,400ft), just after the junction with the pack trail.  This route is the most likely to have a snowfield in late summer, which can be very convenient for refilling water.&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;table class=\"inline_image_thumbs\"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=40767\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/40767.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=40764\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/40764.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=40761\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/40761.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=40901\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/40901.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_3\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Red Tape&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;br&gt;Although Gunsight Peak is in the High Uintas wilderness area, no permits are required, just Leave No Trace traveling.&lt;br&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_4\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;When To Climb&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;br&gt;June through September are often the best months.

It is clearly visible from Owens Valley, and is surrounded by such fine mountains as Mount Humphreys on the southwest, Four Gables on the west and Mount Tom on the north. It is infrequently climbed and is arguably more popular among backcountry skiers than climbers due to its enormous East Couloir that is snow covered until early summer. Not surprisingly, it was first climbed by the legendary Sierra pioneer Norman Clyde. As of today, there are two known routes to the summit:  &lt;p&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div align=\"left\"&gt;    &lt;table border=\"1\" cellspacing=\"0\" width=\"52%\" height=\"28\"&gt;      &lt;tr&gt;        &lt;td width=\"16%\" align=\"center\" height=\"24\"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Name&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/td&gt;        &lt;td width=\"12%\" align=\"center\" height=\"24\"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Difficulty&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/td&gt;        &lt;td width=\"47%\" align=\"center\" height=\"24\"&gt;&lt;b&gt;First Ascent Party and Year&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/td&gt;      &lt;/tr&gt;      &lt;tr&gt;        &lt;td width=\"16%\" bgcolor=\"#C0C0C0\" align=\"center\" height=\"24\"&gt; &lt;/td&gt;        &lt;td width=\"12%\" bgcolor=\"#C0C0C0\" align=\"center\" height=\"24\"&gt; &lt;/td&gt;        &lt;td width=\"47%\" bgcolor=\"#C0C0C0\" align=\"center\" height=\"24\"&gt; &lt;/td&gt;      &lt;/tr&gt;      &lt;tr&gt;        &lt;td width=\"16%\" align=\"center\" height=\"24\"&gt;North Slope&lt;/td&gt;        &lt;td width=\"12%\" align=\"center\" height=\"24\"&gt;Class 2&lt;/td&gt;        &lt;td width=\"47%\" align=\"center\" height=\"24\"&gt;Norman Clyde, 1930&lt;/td&gt;      &lt;/tr&gt;      &lt;tr&gt;        &lt;td width=\"16%\" align=\"center\" height=\"25\"&gt;East Couloir&lt;/td&gt;        &lt;td width=\"12%\" align=\"center\" height=\"25\"&gt;Class 4&lt;/td&gt;        &lt;td width=\"47%\" align=\"center\" height=\"25\"&gt;Dick Beach and Dave King, 1974&lt;/td&gt;      &lt;/tr&gt;    &lt;/table&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;table class=\"inline_image_thumbs\"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=50715\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/50715.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=108044\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/108044.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=50698\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/50698.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=50700\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/50700.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=50714\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/50714.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_2\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Getting There&lt;/h2&gt;The most common approach to both established routes on the mountain is from the east. Take HWY 168 west from the center of Bishop. Proceed approximately 7 1/2 miles and turn right onto Buttermilk Road. At this point, the asphalt on the road is replaced by dirt, although still passable by a 2wd low-clearance vehicle. Stay on Buttermilk Road as it takes you through beautiful Buttermilk Country and famous Buttermilk boulders. The road quality will worsen as you approach the base of the Sierra. If you intend to make it all the way to the trailhead by vehicle, you will want to bring a sturdy high-clearance 4wd. Continue on Buttermilk Road past several forks and turn-outs. When in doubt, take a more traveled right fork. At some point, you will reach the marked intersection of Buttermilk Road and the Horton Lakes trailhead road. Turn right here and follow it for another mile until it reaches a small dead tree forest. If it was challenging for your vehicle to get to this point, you may want to leave it here and hike the final half a mile to the Horton Lakes trailhead. If you are confident in your 4wd beast, continue driving on the rapidly deteriorating road for a little longer until you reach the locked gate. From here you can either walk west towards the base of East Couloir, or follow the jeep road / trail to Horton Lakes to reach the North Slope route.  &lt;p&gt;  If you are hoping to climb this fine peak during heavy snow months, be prepared to leave your vehicle along Buttermilk Road and hike for a couple of miles to the trailhead. The road is not plowed, and can be impassable if conditions are bad.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;table class=\"inline_image_thumbs\"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=50734\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/50734.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=50795\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/50795.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=94788\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/94788.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_3\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Red Tape&lt;/h2&gt;No permits are required if you climb the mountain from the east side. The Horton Lakes trail does have a quota.

During the winter months, East Couloir would be a preferred way due to its shorter approach and wonderful skiing possibilities. During the summer months, one may opt for the non-technical and less steep North Slope route. If you choose to climb this mountain in winter conditions, watch out for the many avalanche-prone slopes and gullies.&lt;br&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_5\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Camping&lt;/h2&gt;Some basic camping is available near the Horton Lakes trailhead. If you are planning to climb the mountain over multiple days, you can either camp at Horton Lakes (North Slope) or in the abandoned mine tunnel at the base of East Couloir. The mentioned mine tunnel is a fantastic bivy spot, located at approximately 10,500\'. It has enough space to fit 9-10 people with comfort, and even has a small backcountry kitchen area. If you are climbing East Couloir and planning to spend a night in the mine tunnel, leave your tent at home - it won\'t be needed!&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;table class=\"inline_image_thumbs\"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=50697\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/50697.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=50733\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/50733.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=104441\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/104441.JPG\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_6\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Mountain Conditions&lt;/h2&gt;Check out the &lt;a href=\"http://www.buhs.k12.ca.us/webcam/index_small.html\"&gt;Bishop Broncos webcam&lt;/a&gt; for a fine view of Basin Mountain and Mount Tom!  &lt;p&gt;  &lt;b&gt;Current Weather Conditions:&lt;/b&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;  &lt;a href=\"http://www.wunderground.com/US/CA/Bishop.html\"&gt;  &lt;img src=\"http://banners.wunderground.com/banner/infobox_both/language/www/US/CA/Bishop.gif\" alt=\"Click for Bishop, California Forecast\" height=\"108\" width=\"144\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;table class=\"inline_image_thumbs\"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=115969\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/115969.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_7\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;External Links&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ul&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://www.geocities.com/spow49/Basin.html\"&gt;Basin; E Couloir Attempt&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://www.climber.org/TripReports/2005/1389.html\"&gt;Basin Mountain East Couloir&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;                     &lt;div align=\"center\"&gt;&lt;a name=\"messages\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_8\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Additions and Corrections&lt;/h2&gt;[ &lt;a href=\"/object_discussion.php?type=vote_comments&amp;amp;object_id=152557&amp;amp;is_addition=1#vote_form\"&gt;Post an Addition or Correction&lt;/a&gt; ]&lt;table cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" style=\"width: 775px;\"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;table cellpadding=\"2\" cellspacing=\"2\" width=\"100%\"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;&lt;span class=\"pagertext\"&gt;Viewing: &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;-&lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt; of &lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td align=\"center\"&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td align=\"right\"&gt;    &lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;table border=\"0\" width=\"775\" class=\"messages\"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td width=\"110\" align=\"left\" valign=\"top\" style=\"padding-top: 6px;\"&gt;&lt;a name=\"121807\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a class=\"dis_user_lnk\" href=\"/users/andy-hyslop/2474\"&gt;Andy Hyslop&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td valign=\"top\" style=\"padding-top: 6px;\"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Untitled Comment&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td align=\"right\" valign=\"top\" nowrap style=\"font-size: 10px;\"&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td valign=\"top\" rowspan=\"2\" align=\"left\" style=\"padding-top: 6px;\"&gt;&lt;p class=\"disc_avatar\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"/users/andy-hyslop/2474\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Andy Hyslop\" width=\"50\" height=\"50\" border=\"0\" src=\"/images/avatars/10627.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=\"font-size: 9px; color: #888;\"&gt;Hasn\'t voted&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td colspan=\"2\" style=\"padding-top: 6px;\"&gt;Did a great run around these peaks in 2003.

Turn left on 3775 E (first left on the road), and then turn right on Timberline Circle. The trailhead begins at a dirt road. There are some signs for the trailhead that are easy to see. Park anywhere along the residential streets.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;  Stairs Gulch Trailhead: Drive up Big Cottonwood Canyon. Soon after two sharp curves in the road about 2 miles up the canyon, there will be a pull off on the right side of the road. This pull off is the second to last one before the road cuts through some rocks on the south side of the small reservoir that is next to the Storm Mountain picnic ground.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;table class=\"inline_image_thumbs\"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=58084\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/58084.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=58085\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/58085.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=115700\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/115700.JPG\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_3\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Red Tape&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;br&gt;Ferguson Canyon and Stairs Gulch lie in the Broad Fork Twin Peaks Wilderness area, so limit party sizes to 10 people or less and practice Leave No Trace ethics. No permits or fees are required to reach either trailhead or the summit.  &lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_4\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;When To Climb&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;br&gt;May through October are the best months.

Its main wall rising 600 ft. above tranquil Tenaya Creek, it captures the attention of all who pass it on directly adjacent route 120. Unshielded by forests or other features, it is one of the most prominent granite monoliths in the Tuolumne Meadows region.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Its prominence, &amp;amp; the proximity of the climbers scaling the dome, invites a great deal of roadside gawkers, from old-school RV drivers, to inquisitive European tourists, to cultural icon Harley Davidson riders whose amazing &amp;amp; awe-inspiring machines can be heard from miles away, to obnoxious teenagers tying up climbers&rsquo; walkie-talkie bands. In most cases (Half Dome cables route aside), one can escape these hordes of freaks by venturing a few miles into the backcountry. As Highway 120 goes about 100 ft. from the base of Pywiack Dome however, it is virtually impossible to do this here. Though you might try climb away from them, many of their voices have powerful lungs behind them, overcoming attempts at escape &amp;amp; necessitating nerves &amp;amp; a measure of patience beyond the already high amount required for rock climbing alone. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As with the majority of the formations in and around Tuolumne, Pywiack Dome&rsquo;s main face has some classic rock climbing routes. These range from the moderate &amp;amp; well-protected (for the uninformed, an extremely rare combination in the Meadows!!) Zee Tree (a 5 pitch YDS 5.7), to the more conventional Tuolumne-style (great yet runout) Aqua Knobby &amp;amp; Dike routes (the Dike Route is rated YDS 5.9R, &amp;amp; has a sphincter-clinching 150 ft. potential fall at one point), &amp;amp; even to a handful of 5.13s. For those climbers who spurn the stereotypical serene \'wilderness experience\' &amp;amp; delight in the aural bliss &amp;amp; nirvana generated by the melodious tones of unrestrained &amp;amp; unmuffled Harleys ridden by their rebellious owners into the sunset, this is also &lt;i&gt;the&lt;/i&gt; place to climb. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As is the norm in the region, the rock quality here is phenomenal. Solid, grippy, &amp;amp; with ever-present knobs, climbing here is a delight. For locals, this is evident as one frequently encounters other climbers who have come from hundreds of miles away, if not from across the country, to climb here for a week or two. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;table class=\"inline_image_thumbs\"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=58167\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/58167.JPG\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=58168\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/58168.JPG\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=58182\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/58182.JPG\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=59509\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/59509.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=121867\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/121867.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_2\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Getting There&lt;/h2&gt;Something to be kept in mind when planning a trip to the area is that unless your access includes snowshoes, snowmobile(s), &amp;amp;/or skis, you&rsquo;ll fit your schedule to that of the seasonal opening times of route 120 (see the &lt;i&gt;&ldquo;When to Climb&rdquo;&lt;/i&gt; section), generally from May/June to October/November. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Coming from outside of California:&lt;/b&gt; The closest major airports are &lt;a href=\"http://www.renoairport.com/\"&gt;Reno/Tahoe International,&lt;/a&gt; &amp;amp; &lt;a href=\"http://www.flyoakland.com/index2.cfm\"&gt;Oakland&lt;/a&gt; &amp;amp; &lt;a href=\"http://www.flysfo.com/\"&gt;San Francisco International&lt;/a&gt; airports. Reno/Tahoe is probably .5 to 1 hour closer to Tuolumne Meadows.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Reno/Tahoe International Airport:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;From Reno, take US 395 south approximately 140 miles. Go through Lee Vining (CA). Half a mile after leaving town, take the US 120 exit west towards Yosemite. Go to the toll booths at Tioga Pass (the highest driveable pass in California), ushering you into Yosemite National Park. &lt;i&gt;See &ldquo;From Tioga Pass.&rdquo;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Eastern Sierra Nevada (California):&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Take 395 to its junction with 120, shortly before reaching Lee Vining. Hang a L, &amp;amp; head for Tioga Pass. &lt;i&gt;See &ldquo;From Tioga Pass.&rdquo;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;San Francisco Bay Area/San Francisco or Oakland International airports:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;From either Oakland or San Francisco, take Interstate 580 east. When you get to the split with Interstate 205, take the 205 east, passing through Tracy (there is an In &lsquo;n&rsquo; Out Burger here- good to know for both the approach or the return). You&rsquo;ll eventually merge with I-5 north. From here, the road will split. Take the one that says 120 East. Take this for approximately 8 miles. Make sure you&rsquo;re in the L-hand lane now as the road splits &amp;amp; highway 120 briefly merges with 99 going north. Very shortly after this (stay in the right-hand lane), take the 120 East exit. From here, you&rsquo;ll drive through Manteca, then countless (well, maybe 20 or so) miles of 2-lane agricultural road before finally reaching beautiful Oakdale, California. Take a left at the 3rd light, at which point the 120 merges with the 108 (there&rsquo;s a fairly large sign shortly before the intersection, but you&rsquo;ll be on the lookout). Go through Oakdale, &amp;amp; get gas (&ldquo;petrol&rsquo;&rdquo; for you folks across the Pond), as it gets a lot pricier from here on out (it&rsquo;s cheapest at the far end of town). This will also be the last resort for cel&rsquo; phone reception for most. Once through Oakdale, go approximately 23 miles on the combined 108/120. Take a right here, where the 120 now splits from the 108 (a sign indicates Sonora straight ahead, &amp;amp; Groveland/Yosemite/Chinese Camp to the R). Take this straight all the way to the Yosemite National Park entrance station. &lt;i&gt;See &ldquo;From the western Yosemite National Park entrance station.&rdquo;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;From the western Yosemite National Park entrance station:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Once through the fee collection station, keep going straight. Take a left where the road splits after 7 or so miles (staying on highway 120) to go towards Tuolumne Meadows. If traffic is light (this is a big if), you&rsquo;ve got probably half an hour&rsquo;s drive from here. After passing Tenaya Lake (there are restrooms here if you need them), you&rsquo;ll briefly drive through the forest. After emerging, Pywiack Dome will seemingly erupt from the valley floor to your right (.8 mile after the far shore of Tenaya Lake). Park at one of the many pullouts, &amp;amp; figure out a convenient place to cross Tenaya Creek (stick to the established climbers&rsquo; trails if you can). &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;From Tioga Pass:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Drive west to Tuolumne Meadows. From the Tuolumne store, it\'s approximately 6.4 miles. To the left will be unmistakable Pywiack Dome. If you somehow drive too far &amp;amp; reach Tenaya Lake, turn around &amp;amp; drive .8 mile. Park at one of the many parking pullouts, and figure out a good place to cross Tenaya Creek &amp;amp; gain access to the base of the cliff. Use established climbers&rsquo; trails when possible. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;table class=\"inline_image_thumbs\"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=62924\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/62924.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_3\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Red Tape&lt;/h2&gt;No page about anything Yosemite National Park would be complete without this section. As great as the national park of Yosemite is, the BS that goes along with enjoying it can be overwhelming at times. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I. Getting in: Just to have the privilege of setting foot (or tire, as the case may be) in Yosemite National Park, you&rsquo;ll have to:&lt;br&gt;a) cough up a wallet-emptying $20, which will allow you in-and-out privileges for 7 days,&lt;br&gt;b) buy an expensive-but-worth it &lt;a href=\"http://www.nps.gov/fees_passes.htm\"&gt;National Parks Pass&lt;/a&gt;- currently (June 2004) $50, which will get you in and out of US national parks for a year, or &lt;br&gt;c) sneak in- this means entering the Park before the rangers can drag their asses out of bed &amp;amp; to the toll booths (while this varies, we&rsquo;re probably talking before 6AM in the summer), &amp;amp; leaving after they decide to call it a day (you&rsquo;re probably safe after 10PM). Have cash, check, or (now- yippee!) credit card ready in case your timing is off. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;II. Food storage: On 5.11.2004, the Park Service announced that bear canisters are required in the backcountry within 7 linear miles of a road, as well as above 9,000 ft. Here is a &lt;a href=\"http://www.nps.gov/yose/wilderness/bfoodstoragem.htm\"&gt;map of required bear can\' areas in YNP&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;III. Check out this &lt;a href=\"http://www.nps.gov/yose/pphtml/fees.html\"&gt;Yosemite fees website&lt;/a&gt; (including the dough you\'ll shell out for the honour of tying the knot here).&lt;br&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_4\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;When To Climb&lt;/h2&gt;Route 120, which provides access to Tuolumne Meadows, is not plowed in the winter, so most climbers must wait until it opens each year. The road is usually closed following the first major snowstorm of the season (late October to mid-November) until the powers that be determine it fit to be opened (usually late May to mid-June). &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Places you can check Route 120 status: &lt;br&gt;* &lt;a href=\"http://www.dot.ca.gov/hq/roadinfo/sr120\"&gt; Caltrans highway 120 site&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;* &lt;a href=\"http://www.nps.gov/yose/now/conditions.htm\"&gt;Yosemite road conditions&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;* Here\'s a table showing &lt;a href=\"http://www.monobasinresearch.org/data/tiogapass.htm\"&gt;past Tioga Pass opening &amp;amp; closing dates.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;* (toll free) Caltrans hotline: 1.800.427.ROAD&lt;br&gt;* Yosemite National Park road information (phone): 209.372.0200&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;table class=\"inline_image_thumbs\"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=58183\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/58183.JPG\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_5\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Camping&lt;/h2&gt;The Tuolumne Meadows campground is 50% first-come first-served. The other half is reserveable from July to September. The cost is $18/night per site (each site can have up to 6 people). Check out &lt;a href=\"http://www.nps.gov/yose/trip/camping.htm\"&gt;the website for Yosemite campgrounds.&lt;/a&gt;  Find the link to the Tuolumne Meadows campground. &lt;i&gt;Warning: there are many merciless mosquitoes here.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There are also multiple campgrounds before entering Yosemite National Park, both coming from highway 395 &amp;amp; coming from the west (look for the little tent signs). Also keep in mind that one can camp free in National Forest lands (outside of established campsites). &lt;a href=\"http://www.yosemite.com/tripplan/camping.html\"&gt;Here is a page&lt;/a&gt; showing some campgrounds outside of the Park. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;To camp in the backcountry around Tuolumne, a wilderness permit must be obtained. One can get a wilderness permit from the Tuolumne Wilderness Center (open 9.00 - 17.00; tel: 209.372.0263), off of route 120, slightly east of the actual meadows. As stated in the \"Red Tape\" section, a bear canister is now required within 7 linear miles from the road, as well as above 9,000 ft. This includes anywhere you\'re likely to stay while climbing Pywiack Dome. &lt;a href=\"http://www.nps.gov/yose/wilderness/bfoodstoragem.htm\"&gt;Here is a map of required bear can\' areas in YNP.&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_6\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Mountain Conditions&lt;/h2&gt;As elaborated on in the &ldquo;When to Climb&rdquo; section, the Tuolumne Meadows area during the winter, like the rest of Yosemite &amp;amp; much of the Sierra Nevada, gets a lot of snow- enough that they don&rsquo;t feel it worth plowing the road to keep the area open. So conditions that probably concern you are gonna be during the late spring/summer/early fall. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Some of the routes in Tuolumne are veritable waterfalls, either in a thunderstorm, or due to snow melt (one of the routes on Pywiack Dome is &ldquo;Aqua Knobby&rdquo;). Keep this in mind both in early season when the snow is still melting and when considering potential climbing conditions, should clouds build while you&rsquo;re climbing &amp;amp; decide to expunge their contents onto you. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The weather in Tuolumne Meadows during the summer is known to be excellent- frequently sunny &amp;amp; warm, but not hot. Many climbers who spend their time in Yosemite Valley during other times of the year retreat to this haven to escape the oven-like temperatures that are common in &ldquo;The Valley&rdquo; in the summer. Having said this, storm clouds can &amp;amp; do build up occasionally while climbers are in the middle of a climb. As Pywiack Dome (as many of its brethren) has little vegetation on its steep granite slopes, you will be without much competition come a lightning storm. Thus it is advisable to start early, climb fast, &amp;amp; keep escape options in mind. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&middot;&lt;a href=\"http://cdec.water.ca.gov/cgi-progs/queryF?TUM\"&gt;California Dept. of Water Resources daily summary of conditions in Tuolumne&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&middot;&lt;a href=\"http://www.nps.gov/yose/wilderness/trailconditions.htm\"&gt;Monthly wilderness conditions update&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_7\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Summit Views&lt;/h2&gt;Though lower than many of the surrounding formations, the views from the top of Pywiack Dome are nonetheless phenomenal. Right at one&rsquo;s feet lies tranquil Tenaya Lake, with the impressive granite monolith of &lt;a href=\"http://www.summitpost.org/show/mountain_link.pl/mountain_id/2140\"&gt;Tenaya Peak&lt;/a&gt; rising proudly from its shores. In the distance, the unmistakable profile of &lt;a href=\"http://www.summitpost.org/show/mountain_link.pl/mountain_id/221\"&gt;Half Dome&lt;/a&gt; is easily discerned. The masses of Mountaineers Dome &amp;amp; Polly Dome are directly across the valley. The Lamb is discerned slightly farther away, also right off of 120. The classic W Ridge &amp;amp; SW face of mighty &lt;a href=\"http://www.summitpost.org/show/mountain_link.pl/mountain_id/335\"&gt;Mt. Conness&lt;/a&gt; are far off in the distance. The top of great &lt;a href=\"http://www.summitpost.org/show/mountain_link.pl/mountain_id/1550\"&gt;Fairview Dome&lt;/a&gt; can be discerned behind the bulk of Medlicott Dome, while the sublime lines of  &lt;a href=\"http://www.summitpost.org/show/mountain_link.pl/mountain_id/392\"&gt;Cathedral Peak&lt;/a&gt; rise up above their great granite foundation on the other side of the valley from Pywiack Dome. In short, the scenery surrounding one on the summit of Pywiack Dome is jaw-dropping (if possible, catch a summer sunset here!). &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;table class=\"inline_image_thumbs\"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=58170\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/58170.JPG\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=58169\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/58169.JPG\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=118109\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/118109.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_8\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Additional Beta&lt;/h2&gt;&amp;gt; &lt;a href=\"http://www.nps.gov/yose/index.htm\"&gt;Official Yosemite National Park (YNP) page&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt; &lt;a href=\"http://data2.itc.nps.gov/parks/yose/ppMaps/YOSEpark2003%2Epdf\"&gt;YNP map&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt; Additional climbing &amp;amp; route info: &lt;a href=\"http://www.supertopo.com/climbingareas/tuolumne.html\"&gt;Supertopo page on Tuolumne Meadows&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_9\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Etymology&lt;/h2&gt;&ldquo;The north or Ten-ie-ya branch of the Merced, which comes down the North Ca&ntilde;on from the glistening rocks at its source, was called Py-we-ack, &lsquo;the river of glistening rocks,&rsquo; or more literally, perhaps, &lsquo;the river-smoothed rocks,&rsquo;&rdquo; (Bunnell, Discovery, 1911, 207) Both the creek and Tenaya Lake were called &ldquo;Py-we-ack&rdquo; by the native Americans. The BGN revoked that name in 1932 and approved &ldquo;Pywiack.&rdquo; &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Whitney Survey of 1863 remarked upon Pywiack Dome: &ldquo;At the head of Lake Tenaya is a very conspicuous conical knob of bare granite, about 800 feet high, the sides of which are everywhere finely polished and grooved by former glaciers.&rdquo; It was known early on by various names, including &ldquo;Murphy&rsquo;s Dome,&rdquo; &ldquo;Teapot Dome,&rdquo; &ldquo;Matthes Dome,&rdquo; &ldquo;Ten-ieya Dome,&rdquo; &amp;amp; &ldquo;Turtle Rock.&rdquo; The actual name &ldquo;Pywiack Dome&rdquo; was recommended by David Brower in the early 1950s, and first appeared on the 1956 15-minute quad.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_10\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Images&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div align=\"center\"&gt;&lt;table id=\"my_images\"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/beautiful-rock/239679/c-152754\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Beautiful Rock\" src=\"/images/square/239679.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/pywiack-dome-19-june-2004/58167/c-152754\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Pywiack Dome- 19 June, 2004\" src=\"/images/square/58167.JPG\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/pywiack-dome-from-tenaya-lake/582513/c-152754\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Pywiack Dome from Tenaya Lake\" src=\"/images/square/582513.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/pywiack-dome-19-june-2004/58168/c-152754\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Pywiack Dome- 19 June, 2004\" src=\"/images/square/58168.JPG\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/the-lamb-mt-conness/58170/c-152754\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"The Lamb, Mt.

Big Horn is the name used in some of the older publication (Such as &lt;i&gt;Hikers Guide to Utah&lt;/i&gt;), and I believe it was the Wasatch Mountain Club who started refering to the peak as \"Upper Bells Peak\".    It seems to be best known as \"Big Horn\" locally, but members of the WMC still always use the name Upper Bells Peak in their publications.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r&lt;br&gt;I just thought you might find the info interesting, but either way, it doesn\'t matter to me what the peak is called, because its spectacular either way.&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td valign=\"bottom\" style=\"padding-top: 6px;\" colspan=\"2\"&gt;&lt;span style=\"font-size: 9px; color: #888;\"&gt;Posted Aug 17, 2005 3:30 pm&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;table border=\"0\" width=\"775\"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;table cellpadding=\"2\" cellspacing=\"2\" width=\"100%\"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;&lt;span class=\"pagertext\"&gt;Viewing: &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;-&lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt; of &lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td align=\"center\"&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td align=\"right\"&gt;    &lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_8\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Images&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div align=\"center\"&gt;&lt;table id=\"my_images\"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/on-the-peak-of-bighorn/412531/c-152831\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"On the Peak of Bighorn\" src=\"/images/square/412531.JPG\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/lone-peak-s-notch-and-the-bighorn/492416/c-152831\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Lone Peak\\\'s Notch and the Bighorn\" src=\"/images/square/492416.JPG\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/bighorn-peak/517087/c-152831\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Bighorn Peak.\" src=\"/images/square/517087.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/lone-peak-from-the-slopes-of/571879/c-152831\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Lone Peak from the slopes of...........\" src=\"/images/square/571879.JPG\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/upper-bells-on-february-10-2010/596049/c-152831\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Upper Bells on February 10, 2010\" src=\"/images/square/596049.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/upper-bells-and-lone-peaks/466061/c-152831\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Upper Bells and Lone Peaks\" src=\"/images/square/466061.JPG\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view-from-the-summit-looking/61110/c-152831\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"View from the summit looking...\" src=\"/images/square/61110.JPG\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/bighorn-peak-viewed-from-the/61099/c-152831\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Bighorn Peak, viewed from the...\" src=\"/images/square/61099.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/the-alpine-ridge/571767/c-152831\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"The Alpine Ridge....\" src=\"/images/square/571767.JPG\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/east-face-of-bighorn-peak/125909/c-152831\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"East face of Bighorn Peak....\" src=\"/images/square/125909.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view-from-s-thunder/413307/c-152831\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"view from S Thunder\" src=\"/images/square/413307.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/bighorn-peak-from-the-lake-hardy-trail/413301/c-152831\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Bighorn Peak from the Lake Hardy trail\" src=\"/images/square/413301.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/city-of-alpine-and-utah-lake/641760/c-152831\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"City of Alpine and Utah Lake\" src=\"/images/square/641760.JPG\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/lone-peak-from-bighorn-peak/417134/c-152831\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Lone Peak from Bighorn Peak\" src=\"/images/square/417134.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td colspan=\"7\" align=\"center\"&gt;[ &lt;a href=\"/bighorn-peak-upper-bells-peak/images/p-152831\"&gt;View Gallery - 35 More Images&lt;/a&gt; ]&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/article&gt;date:difficulty:'),(116,152853,'/pioneer-peak/152853','/wasatch-range-central/171209','Pioneer Peak','','','','10450','',9111,40.5809,-111.589,'Utah, United States, North America','','',171209,'Wasatch Range (Central)','','','','','','Mountain-Rock','content: &lt;article&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_1\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2 id=\"first_h2\"&gt;Overview&lt;/h2&gt;       Pioneer Peak is one of several peaks along the ridgeline that terminates Big Cottonwood Canyon.

This peak, while small, is very picturesque, offering fantastic views of the Brighton Ski area, as well as Little Cottonwood Canyon and Alta\'s Albion Basin and American Fork Canyon. The open slopes are great for easily accessible backcountry skiing. This peak is also along the Brighton Ridge Run route and abuts Point Supreme and Catherine Pass, which have nice side trails and views themselves. &lt;br&gt;During the summer, the peak can be climbed via some vague use trails that follow the ridgeline from Brighton\'s Crest Express lift to Sunrise Peak.

Besides being a scenic hike, with some mild scrambling and easy routefinding, these cliffs offer many good backcountry skiing opportunities off of them. Several of Solitudes skiing runs run below these beautiful escarpments. &lt;br&gt;The slopes all around the Honeycomb Cliffs are littered with many old mine shafts and tailings, which can make for some interesting sightseeing.&lt;br&gt;In order to effectively clear these cliffs of avalanche danger to skiers, cords are anchored to different summits along the ridgeline such that they span over the cliffs on the Solitude side. From these cords hang moveable smaller wires that can be used to remotely deliver explosives to starting zones in a safe and controlled manner.&lt;br&gt;A personal note: I\'ve found these cliffs as a nice way to end the Brighton Ridge Run.&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;table class=\"inline_image_thumbs\"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=121543\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/121543.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=123266\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/123266.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_2\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Getting There&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;br&gt;Driving time from downtown Salt Lake City is approximately 50 minutes. &lt;br&gt;From I-15 southbound near downtown Salt Lake City, follow these directions &lt;br&gt;I-15 S toward LAS VEGAS/CHEYENNE. 8.3 miles &lt;br&gt;Take the I-215 exit- exit number 302- toward BELT ROUTE. 0.2 miles &lt;br&gt;Merge onto I-215 E via the exit- on the left- toward SKI AREAS. 5.1 miles &lt;br&gt;Take the 6200 SO. exit- exit number 6- toward SKI AREAS/SOLITUDE / BRIGHTON/SNOWBIRD / ALTA. 0.2 miles &lt;br&gt;Take the ramp toward SKI AREAS/SOLITUDE / BRIGHTON/SNOWBIRD / ALTA. 0.1 miles &lt;br&gt;Turn RIGHT onto UT-190 E/E 6200 S.

If you want to start at the trailhead, you must continue up the road to Albion Basin.

This portion of the trail is very popular and sees heavy foot traffic, especially on early summer weekends when wildflowers are in full bloom.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;From the lake follow a faint hikers trail around the north side of the lake, and head for the Sugarloaf ski lift which can be seen a short distance to the west.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Eventually you will intersect a service road which winds its way up to the top of the Sugarloaf ski lift.  Either follow the road or proceed directly up the slopes to the top of the lift.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;At the top of the lift you will be at a saddle with Sugarloaf Peak to the east and Mount Baldy to the west.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;From the saddle follow an unmaintained trail up the south-east ridge to the summit.

By its easiest route it is class 2, but the summit has a sheer NE face that includes some technical climbs to the summit.  &lt;p&gt;  Admittedly this mountain doesn\'t offer much summitting interest in comparison to the surrounding peaks in the Palisades region, but after having climbed it, I would say that a trip to the summit is well worth the effort if you\'re in the area. You have some really nice views of &lt;a href=\"http://www.summitpost.org/show/mountain_link.pl/mountain_id/381\"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Polemonium Peak&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"http://www.summitpost.org/show/mountain_link.pl/mountain_id/267\"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mt Sill&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt; from an angle that few people have seen these peaks from. It also has a stellar view of the &lt;a href=\"http://www.summitpost.org/show/mountain_link.pl/mountain_id/3960\"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Palisade Crest&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, with &lt;a href=\"http://www.summitpost.org/mountains/photo_link.pl/p/photo_id__134729__object_id__3960__type__mountain__mountain_id__3960__route_id____user_id____order_by____limit__\"&gt;Gandalf Peak&lt;/a&gt; rising prominently above the jagged ridgeline - in fact Mt Jepson can easily be \'bagged\' while climbing the Crest, as they both share the same approach from the east or the west.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;  While the peak is easy by technical rating, it is still  quite a physical challenge to reach the summit. All routes to the peak require significant cross-country travel over rough terrain. The easiest approach is via the South Fork of Big Pine, where one must climb up through Scimitar Pass, gaining some 6,500 ft round trip.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;table border=\"1\" cellspacing=\"0\"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;  &lt;table border=\"0\" cellspacing=\"2\" cellpadding=\"2\"&gt;    &lt;tr bgcolor=\"#c0c0c0\"&gt;&lt;td colspan=\"5\"&gt;&lt;font style=\"font-weight:bold;\"&gt;ROUTES OVERVIEW&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;  &lt;tr&gt;  &lt;td align=\"center\"&gt;&lt;font style=\"font-weight:bold;\"&gt;Route&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/td&gt;  &lt;td align=\"center\"&gt;&lt;font style=\"font-weight:bold;\"&gt;Difficulty&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/td&gt;  &lt;td align=\"center\"&gt;&lt;font style=\"font-weight:bold;\"&gt;FA&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/td&gt;  &lt;td align=\"center\"&gt;&lt;font style=\"font-weight:bold;\"&gt;FA Party&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/td&gt;  &lt;td align=\"center\"&gt;&lt;font style=\"font-weight:bold;\"&gt;Photos&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/td&gt;    &lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;  &lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://www.summitpost.org/show/route_link.pl/route_id/3659/object_id/3450\"&gt;South Slopes&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;  &lt;td align=\"center\"&gt;cl. 2&lt;/td&gt;  &lt;td align=\"center\"&gt;1939&lt;/td&gt;  &lt;td&gt;Don McGeein, Chet Errett, and Evelyn Errett.&lt;/td&gt;  &lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://www.summitpost.org/mountains/photo_link.pl/p/photo_id__101165__object_id__3450__type__mountain__mountain_id__3450__route_id____user_id____order_by____limit__\"&gt;(1)&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"http://www.summitpost.org/mountains/photo_link.pl/p/photo_id__101159__object_id__3450__type__mountain__mountain_id__3450__route_id____user_id____order_by____limit__\"&gt;(2)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;    &lt;tr&gt;  &lt;td bgcolor=\"#e0e0e0\"&gt;Northeast Face&lt;/td&gt;  &lt;td bgcolor=\"#e0e0e0\" align=\"center\"&gt;III, 5.8&lt;/td&gt;  &lt;td bgcolor=\"#e0e0e0\" align=\"center\"&gt;1970&lt;/td&gt;  &lt;td bgcolor=\"#e0e0e0\"&gt;Doug Robinson and Don Jensen&lt;/td&gt;  &lt;td bgcolor=\"#e0e0e0\"&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;    &lt;tr&gt;  &lt;td&gt;The Steeple&lt;/td&gt;  &lt;td align=\"center\"&gt;II, 5.8&lt;/td&gt;  &lt;td align=\"center\"&gt;19??&lt;/td&gt;  &lt;td&gt;Richard Dobeman and John Fischer&lt;/td&gt;  &lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;  &lt;/table&gt;  &lt;i&gt;&lt;small&gt;First ascent information used from R.J.

Glacier Lodge Road) in the town of Big Pine.  The turn is by the Texaco Station.  Follow the road about 13 miles to its end at the mouth of Big Pine.   &lt;p&gt;  If you\'re staying the night, you must park at the backpacker\'s parking lot, about 0.5 miles back down the road.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;  Start at the Big Pine Trailhead from the hikers parking lot (7,677ft) at the end of the road.  There is only one bearbox at the parking area, and you should not leave any food in your car.&lt;br&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_3\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Red Tape &amp;amp; Mountain Conditions&lt;/h2&gt;Overnight permits are required and quotas for the South Fork of Big Pine Creek are in effect from May 15 to September 15. The South Fork is far less popular than the North Fork trail, so getting permits is not usually a problem.     Those approaching from the south will be travelling through and camping in SeKi National Park, also requiring permits.     Everything you need to know about conditions, permits and regulations can be found on the &lt;a href=\"http://www.summitpost.org/show/mountain_link.pl/mountain_id/4859\"&gt;Eastern Sierra - Logisitcal Center&lt;/a&gt; page.&lt;br&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_4\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;When To Climb&lt;/h2&gt;May to October are considered the prime climbing months in the area, although it might be best done as a spring climb so that the loose talus and scree around Scimitar Pass is still underneath the snowpack. The approach is long and hard during this ideal time of the year, so a winter approach would be longer and would require much more time and gear. Also, the final stretches up to Scimitar Pass could be avalanche prone.&lt;br&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_5\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Camping&lt;/h2&gt;There are a couple of campsite in the area.  The Big Pine Campground is closest to the trailhead.  &lt;p&gt;  &lt;b&gt;SAGE FLAT CAMPGROUND&lt;/b&gt; - 7,400\' - USFS Campground. Via U.S.395 tum west on Crocker Street in Big Pine, 8 miles to camp. Restrooms, piped water, grills, firepits, tables, fishing. 28 spaces.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;  &lt;b&gt;UPPER SAGE FLAT CAMPGROUND&lt;/b&gt; - 7,600\' - USFS Campground. Reservations. Via U. S.395 turn west on Crocker Street in Big Pine, 9 miles to camp.

Restrooms, piped water,  grills, tables, fishing. 2 spaces.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;  &lt;b&gt;BIG PINE CREEK CAMPGROUND&lt;/b&gt;  - 7,700\' - USFS Campground. Reservations. Via U.S.395 tum west on Crocker Street in Big Pine, 10 miles to camp. Restrooms, piped water, grills, firepits, tables, fishing. 30 spaces.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;  &lt;b&gt;FIRST FALLS WALK-IN CAMP&lt;/b&gt; - 8,300\' - USFS Campground. Stream water, pit toilets, tables, grills, fishing. 5 spaces.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;  Camping is also available in most areas of the John Muir and Sequoia/Kings Wilderness areas. For north side approaches, by far the most popular camp location is found along the shores of Elinore Lake. With shade and easy access to water, Elinore Lake is only about 1 1/2 miles from the summit.   &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;  On the south side, suitable campsites can be found along the John Muir Trail in the vicinity of Palisade Lakes or lower down in Deer Creek Meadow where Glacier Creek joins Palisade Creek. Higher campsites in more barren surroundings can be found in Palisade Basin or along the shores of Lake 3559m.   &lt;br&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_6\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;External Links&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://www.snwburd.com/bob/trip_reports/palisade_crest_1.html\"&gt;Palisade Crest/Jepson dayhike - Aug 6, 2004&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://www.summitpost.org/trip-report/169860/My-First-Sierra-Challenge-2004-.html\"&gt;My First Sierra Challenge (2004)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;                     &lt;a name=\"chapter_7\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Images&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div align=\"center\"&gt;&lt;table id=\"my_images\"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view-northwest-from-kid-mountain/960805/c-152909\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"View Northwest From Kid Mountain\" src=\"/images/square/960805.JPG\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/palisades/869937/c-152909\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Palisades\" src=\"/images/square/869937.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/route-from-elinore-lake-to/64051/c-152909\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Route from Elinore Lake to...\" src=\"/images/square/64051.JPG\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/mt-jepson-and-surroundings/113664/c-152909\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Mt Jepson and surroundings...\" src=\"/images/square/113664.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/august-6th-2004-mt-sill/90276/c-152909\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"August 6th, 2004 - Mt Sill...\" src=\"/images/square/90276.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/august-6th-2004-mt/90277/c-152909\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"August 6th, 2004 - Mt...\" src=\"/images/square/90277.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/route-from-big-pine-trailhead/64057/c-152909\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Route from Big Pine Trailhead...\" src=\"/images/square/64057.JPG\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/jepson-summit-shot/64615/c-152909\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Jepson summit shot.\" src=\"/images/square/64615.JPG\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/article&gt;date:difficulty:'),(125,153021,'/chocolate-peak/153021','/john-muir-wilderness/170988','Chocolate Peak','','','','11682','',14702,37.14,-118.54,'California, United States, North America','','',170988,'John Muir Wilderness','','','','','','Mountain-Rock','content: &lt;article&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_1\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2 id=\"first_h2\"&gt;Overview&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;br&gt;The standout on Chocolate Peak is its color.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For most, climbing Chocolate Peak is an entree or a dessert after climbing Cloudripper.  From the Bishop Pass trail or the Chocolate Lakes it will take 20 minutes tops to check off Chocolate Peak.  Climbing the peak seems to be somewhat popular from vestiges of use trails I came across while scrambling up it.  From the northwest side, it is a class 2 scramble and from the southeast side it is a class 2 scramble.  For the full chocolate experience, I would climb it from the northeast side off of Bishop Pass trail because that is the chocolate colored side.   You would be hard pressed to find anything more than class 2 on small peak.&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;table class=\"inline_image_thumbs\"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=67829\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/67829.JPG\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=67893\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/67893.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=67828\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/67828.JPG\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=121845\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/121845.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_2\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Getting There&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;br&gt;From 395 in the town of Bishop, head west on 168/West Line Street, one of the few stoplights in town.

After a mile there is a junction with Treasure Lakes Trail, follow Bishop Pass Trail to the left. After another mile there is a junction with Bull Lake and Chocolate Lake, hang a left.

Due east of the highest Chocolate lake there is is a Class 2-3 chute that leads directly up to a plateau between Cloudripper and Vagabond.  If you stick to the side of the chute, it is quality climbing on slab and blocks.  When you gain the top of the chute, Vagabond is to your left and Clouldripper is to your right.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For directions up the north side of Vagabond, see Bob\'s &lt;a href=\"http://www.snwburd.com/bob/trip_reports/cloudripper_1.html\"&gt;trip report&lt;/a&gt; for Cloudripper.&lt;br&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_3\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Red Tape&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;br&gt;Wilderness permits are required anytime for overnight camping.

However, since it lies a considerable distance (0.93 miles) from the nearest named summit, &lt;a href=\"http://www.summitpost.org/show/mountain_link.pl/mountain_id/2343\"&gt;&lt;b&gt;South Thunder Mountain&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, it was decided to include Chipman Peak as a distinct peak on Summitpost.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Also taken into consideration was the fact that Chipman Peak is located on a spur ridge perpendicular to the main ridge between South Thunder Mountain and the &lt;a href=\"http://www.summitpost.org/show/mountain_link.pl/mountain_id/1236\"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Pfeifferhorn&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, therefore it is not automatically climbed as a \'pass-over peak\' when traversing the ridge between these other two summits.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;table class=\"inline_image_thumbs\"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=71018\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/71018.JPG\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=71014\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/71014.JPG\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=71015\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/71015.JPG\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=71017\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/71017.JPG\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=84138\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/84138.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_3\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Routes Overview&lt;/h2&gt;Chipman peak is located on a short spur ridge extending south from lightning ridge, roughly midway between the &lt;a href=\"http://www.summitpost.org/show/mountain_link.pl/mountain_id/1236\"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Pfeifferhorn&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to the east, and &lt;a href=\"http://www.summitpost.org/show/mountain_link.pl/mountain_id/2343\"&gt;&lt;b&gt;South Thunder Mountain&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to the west.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Chipman Peak is probably most commonly climbed as part of the &lt;a href=\"http://www.summitpost.org/mountains/route_link.pl/route_id/4531/object_id/1236\"&gt;Beatout&lt;/a&gt; hike, which typically begins with an ascent of  the Pfeifferhorn via &lt;a href=\"http://www.summitpost.org/show/route_link.pl/route_id/1593/object_id/1236\"&gt;Red Pine Canyon&lt;/a&gt;, followed by a 2-mile ridge traverse to South Thunder Mountain.  An ascent of Chipman Peak during the Beatout hike becomes a relatively trivial matter of making the short 0.2 mile boulder hop south to the summit of Chipman.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A similar approach but in reverse direction would involve first ascending South Thunder Mountain via &lt;a href=\"http://www.summitpost.org/show/route_link.pl/route_id/2211/object_id/2343\"&gt;Bells Canyon&lt;/a&gt;, then making a 3/4 mile traverse south-east from the summit of South Thunder to Chipman.  This approach would involve considerably more elevation gain due to the lower elevation of the Bells Canyon trailhead.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Either of these approaches to Chipman will involve 10-12 miles, &plusmn;6,000 feet of elevation gain/loss, and much class 3 scrambling with routefinding.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;An even longer traverse to Chipman Peak could be be created by following the ridge east from &lt;a href=\"http://www.summitpost.org/show/mountain_link.pl/mountain_id/1400\"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Lone Peak&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and/or &lt;a href=\"http://www.summitpost.org/show/mountain_link.pl/mountain_id/3352\"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Bighorn Peak&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.  An ascent of South Thunder Mountain would not be required from this approach.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Two other possible approaches to Chipman Peak exist to the south; Chipman Canyon, and Dry Creek Canyon.  Route descriptions for these approaches will be added in the future.&lt;br&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_4\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Red Tape&lt;/h2&gt;Chipman Peak is located in the &lt;a href=\"http://www.fs.fed.us/r4/wcnf/unit/slrd/wilderness/lone_peak_wilderness.shtml\" target=\"blank\"&gt;Lone Peak Wilderness Area&lt;/a&gt;.

The exception would be an approach originating in American Fork Canyon, which requires a $3.00 entrance fee to enter the canyon.&lt;br&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_5\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;When To Climb&lt;/h2&gt;Spring through late fall for hikers and scramblers.

(Open late May/early June through October/November; overnight parking not permitted beginning October 15th.)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;See more detailed directions at the page for &lt;a href=\"http://www.summitpost.org/logistical-center/150832/tuolumne-meadows-logistical-center.html\"&gt;Tuolumne Meadows - Logistical Center&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Park at the large dirt pullout on the right just past the Tuolumne Meadows gas station/gear shop.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;From here, take the nature trail across the meadow.  PLEASE KEEP OFF MEADOW.  When you reach the slab, veer left to the climbing routes or stay on the trail to the east side of the slab for the walk up.  The earlier you hit the slab, the steeper it is.  The area directly above where the trail gets to the slab is 3rd class friction.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The trail meets the cliff about 100 yards from the parking lot.&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;table class=\"inline_image_thumbs\"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=114363\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/114363.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_3\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Red Tape&lt;/h2&gt;Must pay $20 fee to get into the park, other than that, no red tape...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In this area, backcountry permits are required.

Continue straight through the stoplight and follow the road another 4 miles to the mouth of Little Cottonwood Canyon, where an electronic billboard on the right provides current road and/or weather conditions. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Continue east up Little Cottonwood Canyon approximately 8.3 miles to the Forest Service garage, an old stone structure located on the left (north) side of the road.  Park along the road to the east of the garage, or in the large parking area across the road.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Refer to the &lt;a href=\"http://www.summitpost.org/flagstaff-mountain/routes/p-153143\"&gt;Routes&lt;/a&gt; section for details on ascending the peak.&lt;br&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_3\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Red Tape&lt;/h2&gt;There are no fees or permits required for hiking in this area. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The initial portions of the trail passes near several private cabins; be respectful of the local property owners.&lt;br&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_4\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;When To Climb&lt;/h2&gt;June through September is generally considered to be the summer hiking season.

From a distance, it looks like nothing more than a bump along the ridge that also contains Notchtop, Knobtop &amp;amp; Gabletop Mountains, and is often \"climbed\" in conjunction with these other peaks.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Ptarmigan Point serves as the western most, and deepest summit that makes up the walls of Odessa Gorge, a dramatic, glacially carved gorge in the heart of Rocky Mountain National Park.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This peak is easliy accessible from the Flattop Mountain Trail and lies along the Continental Divide just to the Northwest of Flattop Mountain, overlooking the Bighorn Flats. It has a great little summit block, and provides for interesting views of many of the parks high peaks. It is also, as its name suggests, a great place to see Ptarmigan. This Tundra-loving bird changes from brown to white every year and blends in very well with its surroundings. So keep a sharp eye out!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Round Trip: 10.5 miles&lt;br&gt;Elevation Gain: 2,888 feet&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;table class=\"inline_image_thumbs\"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=72702\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/72702.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=72704\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/72704.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_2\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Getting There&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;br&gt;You will want to start your hike from Bear Lake, in Rocky Mountain National Park. The easiest way to get to Bear Lake, will be to enter the Park at the Beaver Meadows Entrance (hwy 36). Take your first left onto Bear Lake Road, and follow it until it dead ends (about 10 miles) at the Bear Lake Parking Lot. Follow the path about 1/4th of the way around the lake until you see the trail with sign directing you to Flattop Mountain.

You can buy a week pass for $15, or an annual pass for $30. If you plan on camping , you will need to contact the Backcountry Office at 970-586-1242. Fees for camping vary, depending on the season, and the number in your party. A parking pass will only be required when parking overnight. A pass is included in the price of you backcountry camping permit.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://www.nps.gov/romo/visit/fees.html\"&gt; Fees for admission.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://www.nps.gov/romo/visit/park/protecting.html\"&gt; Basic Rules/Regulations&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_4\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;When To Climb&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;br&gt;Ptarmigan Point can be climbed any time of the year. However, the Flattop Mountain Trail is basically snow free from June through September. So the Summer and early Fall are the easiest times to climb this mountain. It is just a little harder in the Winter, simply because it\'s more work using snowshoes. You will not need crampons or an ice axe.&lt;br&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_5\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Camping&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;br&gt;Camping is allowed in the National Park. There are a few campsites in the area, some closer to Ptarmigan Point than others. There are no campsites on the Flattop Mountain Trail.

Whitney, wholely within the John Muir Wilderness. Though one of the 20 highest peaks in California, it is overshadowed by taller and more popular peaks that crowd it on three sides: Mts. &lt;a href=\"http://www.summitpost.org/show/mountain_link.pl/mountain_id/297\"&gt;Williamson&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"http://www.summitpost.org/show/mountain_link.pl/mountain_id/300\"&gt;Tyndall&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"http://www.summitpost.org/show/mountain_link.pl/mountain_id/1466\"&gt;Barnard&lt;/a&gt;. Coupled with the fact that it comes up 53 feet short of being a coveted 14er, it sees relatively few visitors.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The peak is not technically difficult, no more than class 2 from most approaches. Even more so than nearby Mt. Barnard, the peak is a very high pile of rubble and sand whose tediousness at altitude can tax even the most ardent peakbagger.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The name of the peak was suggested by Chester &lt;a href=\"http://www.snwburd.com/bob/etymology/versteeg.html\"&gt;Versteeg&lt;/a&gt; and Ralph Chase for their Alma Mater, the University of Southern California. Versteeg\'s first suggestion, Southern California Peak, was rejected by the BGN (a wise decision to avoid a confusingly named peak). Versteeg was also responsible for naming Lake Helen of Troy, located just northwest of the peak.&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;table class=\"inline_image_thumbs\"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=77348\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/77348.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=77349\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/77349.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=124965\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/124965.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_2\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Getting There&lt;/h2&gt;All the approaches to Trojan Peak are long and arduous, and almost always done as a multiday backpack trip. In fact, Trojan Peak is rarely the primary objective of any given outing, often the second or third peak to be climbed in the area. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The shortest approach is via George Creek, a classic Eastern Sierra bushwhack amply described on Mt. Williamson\'s &lt;a href=\"http://www.summitpost.org/show/route_link.pl/route_id/599/object_id/297\"&gt;Southeast Ridge&lt;/a&gt; route page. Somewhere near the 2900m level (yes, this is one of the silly USGS maps that got done in meters) you will be able to see the broad chute leading to the Barnard-Trojan basin. Follow this up for the easiest approach to Trojan\'s Southeast Slopes. An alternative approach is to take the right branch of George Creek (same as you would take to Mt. Williamson) and climbing &lt;a href=\"http://www.topozone.com/map.asp?z=11&amp;amp;n=4055577&amp;amp;e=383132&amp;amp;s=50&amp;amp;size=l&amp;amp;u=1&amp;amp;layer=DRG25\"&gt;this snow-filled chute&lt;/a&gt; to the class 2 Southeast Slopes. Because George Creek is open only until May 15, you are likely to encounter mostly snow above the 3100m level.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A second approach is via the Shepherd Pass TH, hiking up to Shepherd Pass then crossing Williamson Bowl (see the approach description for Williamson\'s &lt;a href=\"http://www.summitpost.org/show/route_link.pl/route_id/785/object_id/297\"&gt;West Face&lt;/a&gt; route). After reaching the highest of the Williamson Bowl lakes, climb southeast to Lake Helen of Troy, then head south to the saddle on the Sierra crest between Trojan Peak and Mt. Versteeg. From the crest it is a straightforward climb to follow the Southwest Ridge. Alternatively, one can climb to the summit from the saddle between it and Mt. Williamson. The easiest climbing is found to the right on the Northwest Face. Both variations from Williamson Bowl are class 2.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A third approach, and by far the least tedious is from the JMT east through Wright Lakes. Leave the JMT in the vicinity of Bighorn Plateau and follow Wright Creek to the northeast, following the middle fork to the west side of the Sierra crest between Mt. Barnard and Trojan Peak. The last 300m to the Sierra crest are steep class 3 and described by Secor as the West Face. Once at the crest, follow the Southwest Ridge to the summit.&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;table class=\"inline_image_thumbs\"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=77347\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/77347.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=77346\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/77346.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_3\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Red Tape &amp;amp; Mountain Conditions&lt;/h2&gt;See the restrictions below concerning the Bighorn Sheep Zoologocial Preserve. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Wilderness Permits are required for overnight visits in the John Muir Wilderness and Sequoia-Kings Canyon National Park. For an east side entry, everything you need to know about conditions, permits and regulations can be found on the &lt;a href=\"http://www.summitpost.org/show/mountain_link.pl/mountain_id/4859\"&gt;Eastern Sierra - Logisitcal Center&lt;/a&gt; page.&lt;br&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_4\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;When To Climb&lt;/h2&gt;Since Trojan Peak falls within the Bighorn Sheep Zoological area, climbs of Trojan Peak are limited throughout the year. George Creek is open only from April 15 to May 15, and Dec 15 to Jan 1. Williamson Bowl is open from Dec 15 to July 15. The Wright Lakes approach is open year round, but the last third of a mile from the Sierra crest eastward falls within the time restrictions for Williamson Bowl. If you are climbing illegally after July 15, at least consider this route as the least disruptive of the three.&lt;br&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_5\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Camping&lt;/h2&gt;In George Creek, there are some suitable flat camp sites at the 2800m level between the two forks of the creek. There are also some sites further up near the 3100m level, which are sometimes just below snowline around early May.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There are some stark and desolate campsites at the two upper lakes in Williamson Bowl. Plenty of water, but no shade and little flora/fauna.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Wright Lakes, with dozens of lakes and alpine meadows, offers probably the best camping options near Trojan Peak. &lt;br&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_6\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;External Links&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://www.snwburd.com/bob/trip_reports/barnard_1.html\"&gt;Barnard/Trojan dayhike - May 8, 2004&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;                     &lt;div align=\"center\"&gt;&lt;a name=\"messages\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_7\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Additions and Corrections&lt;/h2&gt;[ &lt;a href=\"/object_discussion.php?type=vote_comments&amp;amp;object_id=153310&amp;amp;is_addition=1#vote_form\"&gt;Post an Addition or Correction&lt;/a&gt; ]&lt;table cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" style=\"width: 775px;\"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;table cellpadding=\"2\" cellspacing=\"2\" width=\"100%\"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;&lt;span class=\"pagertext\"&gt;Viewing: &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;-&lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt; of &lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td align=\"center\"&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td align=\"right\"&gt;    &lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;table border=\"0\" width=\"775\" class=\"messages\"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td width=\"110\" align=\"left\" valign=\"top\" style=\"padding-top: 6px;\"&gt;&lt;a name=\"131246\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a class=\"dis_user_lnk\" href=\"/users/langenbacher/1860\"&gt;Langenbacher&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td valign=\"top\" style=\"padding-top: 6px;\"&gt;&lt;b&gt;coordinates&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td align=\"right\" valign=\"top\" nowrap style=\"font-size: 10px;\"&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td valign=\"top\" rowspan=\"2\" align=\"left\" style=\"padding-top: 6px;\"&gt;&lt;p class=\"disc_avatar\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"/users/langenbacher/1860\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Langenbacher\" width=\"50\" height=\"50\" border=\"0\" src=\"/images/avatars/193732.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=\"font-size: 9px; color: #888;\"&gt;Hasn\'t voted&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td colspan=\"2\" style=\"padding-top: 6px;\"&gt;coordinates should be 36.64228 N, 118.31531, NAD83 / WGS84  , should they not ?&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td valign=\"bottom\" style=\"padding-top: 6px;\" colspan=\"2\"&gt;&lt;span style=\"font-size: 9px; color: #888;\"&gt;Posted Apr 22, 2006 11:20 pm&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;table border=\"0\" width=\"775\" class=\"messages\"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td width=\"110\" align=\"left\" valign=\"top\" style=\"padding-top: 6px;\"&gt;&lt;a name=\"131664\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a class=\"dis_user_lnk\" href=\"/users/bob-burd/276\"&gt;Bob Burd&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td valign=\"top\" style=\"padding-top: 6px;\"&gt;&lt;b&gt;oops.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td align=\"right\" valign=\"top\" nowrap style=\"font-size: 10px;\"&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td valign=\"top\" rowspan=\"2\" align=\"left\" style=\"padding-top: 6px;\"&gt;&lt;p class=\"disc_avatar\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"/users/bob-burd/276\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Bob Burd\" width=\"50\" height=\"50\" border=\"0\" src=\"/images/avatars/1177.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=\"font-size: 9px; color: #888;\"&gt;Hasn\'t voted&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td colspan=\"2\" style=\"padding-top: 6px;\"&gt;I had two digits switched on the latitude.

Wallace is one of the Evolution Peaks found on the Sierra crest, near the southern end of the the curved, eight-mile long ridgeline that has been dubbed the Evolution Traverse by Peter Croft and others. Resting along the ridge between higher Mts. &lt;a href=\"http://www.summitpost.org/show/mountain_link.pl/mountain_id/1347\"&gt;Haeckel&lt;/a&gt; and Fiske, at class 2 Mt. Wallace is one of the easier peaks in the region to climb. The peak is covered with much loose boulders, talus, and sand, and most routes on the peak are class 2, with the final summit block rating a class 3. It is often climbed in conjunction with nearby Mt. Haeckel which offers better climbing for the most part. Both Wallace and Haeckel are &lt;a href=\"http://angeles.sierraclub.org/peaks/sps/spslist.htm\"&gt;SPS&lt;/a&gt; peaks, which accounts for a good deal of their popularity judging by the register entries.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Approached via the Sierra crest, the route is class 2 from Wallace Col to the south, or class 3 from Mt. Haeckel. Coming from the east, the North Slope and Southeast Slope are class 2. The former is the preferred ascent route and consists of much boulder hopping. The latter is a steep and horribly loose slope - caution is advised if climbing in a party. The East Face is rated class 3-4. From the west, the Southwest Chute is rated class 2 - another steep, loose route.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The summit block is an &lt;a href=\"http://www.snwburd.com/bob/trip_photos/haeckel_1/DSC00040_w.html\"&gt;airy perch&lt;/a&gt; that can hold at most three or four close friends. It is a slightly exposed class 3 mantle from the west side.&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;table class=\"inline_image_thumbs\"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=79114\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/79114.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=79113\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/79113.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=80167\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/80167.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=129041\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/129041.JPG\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_2\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Getting There&lt;/h2&gt;The quickest way to reach Wallace is from the TH at Lake Sabrina. Take SR168 east from Bishop to it\'s terminus, about 23miles. Limited day use parking (for about three cars) can be found  right at the TH, just before the road goes across the dam. A few more spots are just ahead on the opposite side of the road. Overnight parking is found 1/2 mile back at the junction with the road turning off to North Lake. Bummer.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If approaching from the west, leave the JMT in the vicinity of Sapphire Lake, heading east into the large cirque west of Mts. Haeckel and Wallace.&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;table class=\"inline_image_thumbs\"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=108282\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/108282.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_3\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Red Tape &amp;amp; Mountain Conditions&lt;/h2&gt;Overnight permits are required and quotas for the Middle Fork of Bishop Creek are in effect from May 15 to September 15. The area surrounding the Middle Fork of Bishop Creek (which feeds Lake Sabrina) is less popular than the nearby trailheads at South Lake and North Lake, so permits are not usually a problem. Your best bet is to contact the Inyo Ranger station and check on permit availability. Wood fires are not allowed above 10,000ft.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Those approaching from the west will be travelling through and camping in SeKi National Park, also requiring permits.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Everything you need to know about conditions, permits and regulations can be found on the &lt;a href=\"http://www.summitpost.org/show/mountain_link.pl/mountain_id/4859\"&gt;Eastern Sierra - Logisitcal Center&lt;/a&gt; page.&lt;br&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_4\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;When To Climb&lt;/h2&gt;May to October are the usual climbing months. Early in the year there is much snow (and considerably more gear to carry), but this may be an advantage to avoiding the endless talus and boulders in the drainage north and east of the peak.&lt;br&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_5\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Camping&lt;/h2&gt;Camping is allowed in most places of the SEKI and John Muir Wildernesses that surround Mt. Wallace, with proper permits. On the east side of the crest, excellent sites are found at Hungry Packer and Moonlight Lakes. Echo Lake is even closer to the peak, but has limited camping opportunties as the lake is mostly surrounded by rock. On the west side, there are many camping options along the John Muir Trail some 2 miles away. Better camping locations (with actual trees) can be found at Evolution Lake, closer but more desolate camping at Sapphire Lake.&lt;br&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_6\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Etymology&lt;/h2&gt;\"Alfred Russel Wallace (1823-1913), British naturalist, who developed the theory of evolution contemporaneously with &lt;a href=\"http://www.snwburd.com/bob/etymology/darwin.html\"&gt;Darwin&lt;/a&gt;.

A self-taught professional natural history collector who had spent years in South America and Asia, he began work on the species problem in the mid-1850\'s while in the field, publishing little-noticed papers that argued for the fact of evolution on the basis of geographical distributions. In 1858 he suddenly intuited the selection theory without realizing that Darwin already had done so, and ironically wrote to him for help in getting his ideas published. This resulted in the joint paper read before the Royal Society and published that year. Throughout the rest of his life Wallace graciously gave as much credit as possible to Darwin, and the Darwin circle reciprocated by arranging a government pension and assorted honors for Wallace. Although he was less inclined to neo-&lt;a href=\"http://www.snwburd.com/bob/etymology/lamarck.html\"&gt;Lamarck&lt;/a&gt;ism than Darwin himself, he later argued that the theory did not apply to the evolution of man. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;- Lefalophodon (&lt;/b&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://www.nceas.ucsb.edu/~alroy/lefa/Wallace.html\"&gt;&lt;b&gt;online&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;b&gt;)&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_7\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Images&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div align=\"center\"&gt;&lt;table id=\"my_images\"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view-from-just-below-aspendell/943096/c-153374\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"view from just below Aspendell\" src=\"/images/square/943096.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/mt-wallace-summit-panorama/80167/c-153374\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Mt Wallace summit panorama\" src=\"/images/square/80167.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/detail-of-the-sierra-crest/79123/c-153374\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Detail of the Sierra crest...\" src=\"/images/square/79123.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/mt-wallace-viewed-from-the/79113/c-153374\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Mt.

The summit offers excellent views of all the summits comprising the Big Cottonwood Canyon ridge to the south.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;USGS Quads:&lt;br&gt;&lt;li&gt;Mount Aire, Utah (1:24k)&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Salt Lake City, Utah (1:100k)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;table class=\"inline_image_thumbs\"&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=85539\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/85539.jpg\" unselectable=\"on\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=85540\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/85540.jpg\" unselectable=\"on\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=85543\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/85543.jpg\" unselectable=\"on\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=85545\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/85545.jpg\" unselectable=\"on\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=85888\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/85888.jpg\" unselectable=\"on\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_2\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Getting There&lt;/h2&gt;There are several trailheads and routes which may be used for a climb of Reynolds Peak. The most common approach from Mill Creek Canyon is the Big Water Trail, while from the south Big Cottonwood Canyon includes the two common appoaches of Mill D North Fork and Butler Fork. Directions for these trailheads are as follows:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Millcreek Canyon:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;i&gt;Big Water Trailhead&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;br&gt;From I-215 on the east side of Salt Lake valley, take either the 3300 or 3900 South exit, and proceed east to Wasatch Boulevard. Follow Wasatch Boulevard to 3800 South, and look for signs to Mill Creek Canyon. Proceed 9.6 miles up Mill Creek Canyon to a parking area at the end of the road, and the Big Water Trailhead.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Big Cottonwood Canyon:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;i&gt;Mill D North Fork Trailhead&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;br&gt;From the 6200 South exit off I-215, head east and south on State Highway 190 for &plusmn;2 miles to the intersection with Big Cottonwood Canyon road. Turn left at the intersection and drive approximately 9.6 miles east to the Mill D North Fork Trailhead.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;i&gt;Butler Fork Trailhead&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;br&gt;From the 6200 South exit off I-215, head east and south on State Highway 190 for &plusmn;2 miles to the intersection with Big Cottonwood Canyon road. Turn left at the intersection and drive approximately 8 miles east to the Butler Fork Trailhead and parking area, located on the left side of the road.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;table class=\"inline_image_thumbs\"&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=85889\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/85889.jpg\" unselectable=\"on\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=85890\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/85890.jpg\" unselectable=\"on\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_3\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Route Descriptions&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;font color=\"green\"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Big Water Trail&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br&gt;This trail begins from the upper parking area at the end of the Mill Creek Canyon road. The trail is easy to follow and very popular, particularly in the summer when the trail is open to mountain bikes on even-numbered calendar days (plan your hike for an odd-numbered day to avoid sharing the trail with mountain bikers). The trail makes a number of switchbacks as it climbs generally southward. The trail reaches a junction where it converges with the Big Cottonwood Canyon Butler Fork Trail a short distance before arriving at Dog Lake.&lt;blockquote&gt;One-Way Hiking Distance: 2.1 miles&lt;br&gt;Trailhead Elevation: 7,600 ft.&lt;br&gt;Summit Elevation: 9,422 ft.&lt;br&gt;Elevation Gain: 1,822 ft.&lt;br&gt;Average Gain per Mile: 868 ft.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font color=\"green\"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mill D North Fork&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br&gt;This is the shorter of the two common approaches from Big Cottonwood Canyon. The trail is easy to follow and very popular, both as a summer hiking trail and winter ski and snowshoe trail. From the trailhead the trail climbs gradually northeast for approximately 1.5 miles to a trail junction. The right fork continues east to Lake desolation; take the left fork which continues another 0.6 miles northwest to Dog Lake.&lt;blockquote&gt;One-Way Hiking Distance: 2.7 miles&lt;br&gt;Trailhead Elevation: 7,240 ft.&lt;br&gt;Summit Elevation: 9,422 ft.&lt;br&gt;Elevation Gain: 2,182 ft.&lt;br&gt;Average Gain per Mile: 808 ft.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font color=\"green\"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Butler Fork&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br&gt;This route is a slightly longer Big Cottonwood Canyon approach to Reynolds Peak. The trail climbs north for approximately 0.4 miles to a trail junction, with the left heading west into Mill A basin. Take the right fork which continues north before making a gradual bend to the east as it continues up Butler Fork. The trail reaches a junction where it converges with the Mill Creek Canyon Big Water Trail a short distance before arriving at Dog Lake.&lt;blockquote&gt;One-Way Hiking Distance: 2.9 miles&lt;br&gt;Trailhead Elevation: 7,120 ft.&lt;br&gt;Summit Elevation: 9,422 ft.&lt;br&gt;Elevation Gain: 2,302 ft.&lt;br&gt;Average Gain per Mile: 794 ft.&lt;/blockquote&gt;All of the above three routes converge at Dog Lake (el. 8,740 ft.), with the summit of Reynolds Peak approximately 0.5 miles to the southwest. Due to heavy usage the area surrounding Dog Lake is somewhat of a maze of camp and use trails. The trail to the summit of Reynolds Peak is unmarked, but begins near the southwest corner of Dog Lake. The use trails to the south of the correct trail will eventually converge on the true trail, which departs from the west side of the main trail at approximately &lt;font color=\"blue\"&gt;&lt;b&gt;445924E 4501767N&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt; (N40.66500&deg; W111.63976&deg;), el. 8760 ft. The ridge gradually bends westward just before arriving at the summit.&lt;br&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_4\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Red Tape&lt;/h2&gt;Mill Creek Canyon is a fee area. A toll booth is located approximately 1.5 miles up the canyon, and collects a fee of $3.00 per vehicle as you &lt;font color=\"red\"&gt;&lt;b&gt;exit&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt; the canyon. Annual passes may also be purchased for $40.00.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Prior to June 1 each year, a locked gate on Millcreek Canyon road prevents driving the final 3.9 miles to the trailhead. After June 1 the gate remains open until the first significant snowfall of the season.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There are currently no fees required for approaches from Big Cottonwood Canyon.&lt;br&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_5\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;When To Climb&lt;/h2&gt;Reynolds Peak can be ascended year round. Dry hiking can usually be found on the mountain by early to late May, depending on the snowpack, but snow may linger considerably longer on north facing approaches from Butler Fork and Mill Creek Canyon.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Winter months allow for good backcountry skiing and snowshoeing on the mountain. There are several potential avalanche slide paths on the mountain and its various approaches; carefully assess snow conditions before any winter attempts.&lt;br&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_6\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Mountain Conditions&lt;/h2&gt;Weather &lt;a href=\"http://www.brightonresort.com/Weather\"&gt;forecast and current conditions&lt;/a&gt; for nearby Brighton Ski Resort. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;div align=\"center\"&gt;&lt;a name=\"messages\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_7\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Additions and Corrections&lt;/h2&gt;[ &lt;a href=\"/object_discussion.php?type=vote_comments&amp;amp;object_id=153567&amp;amp;is_addition=1#vote_form\"&gt;Post an Addition or Correction&lt;/a&gt; ]&lt;table cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" style=\"width: 775px;\"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;table cellpadding=\"2\" cellspacing=\"2\" width=\"100%\"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;&lt;span class=\"pagertext\"&gt;Viewing: &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;-&lt;b&gt;4&lt;/b&gt; of &lt;b&gt;4&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td align=\"center\"&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td align=\"right\"&gt;    &lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;table border=\"0\" width=\"775\" class=\"messages\"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td width=\"110\" align=\"left\" valign=\"top\" style=\"padding-top: 6px;\"&gt;&lt;a name=\"383502\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a class=\"dis_user_lnk\" href=\"/users/hgrapid/12344\"&gt;hgrapid&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td valign=\"top\" style=\"padding-top: 6px;\"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Directions not clear enough&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td align=\"right\" valign=\"top\" nowrap style=\"font-size: 10px;\"&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td valign=\"top\" rowspan=\"2\" align=\"left\" style=\"padding-top: 6px;\"&gt;&lt;p class=\"disc_avatar\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"/users/hgrapid/12344\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"hgrapid\" width=\"50\" height=\"50\" border=\"0\" src=\"/images/avatars/554689.JPG\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=\"font-size: 9px; color: #888;\"&gt;Voted 5/10&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td colspan=\"2\" style=\"padding-top: 6px;\"&gt;We tried to hike Reynolds Peak based on your directions and the directions were not clear enough, so we had to turn back.  You don\'t specify that A) There is no marked trail leading to Reynolds Peak and B) you have to guess where to go because there are numerous trails that go every which way from Dog Lake, and near Dog Lake.  In fact, we believe the correct trail is near a sign before you reach Dog Lake.  But, this page is not clear enough, and will too likely get more people lost.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;See this page: http://www.micksmtn.20m.com/reynolds.html&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;On it, even they claim that there is a trail, but they couldn\'t find it.  The reason is because it is not at all clear.  So, on this page, you need to clarify.  I can\'t justify any decent score until you rectify this so others do not get lost.&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td valign=\"bottom\" style=\"padding-top: 6px;\" colspan=\"2\"&gt;&lt;span style=\"font-size: 9px; color: #888;\"&gt;Posted Jul 5, 2010 1:51 pm&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;table border=\"0\" width=\"745\" class=\"messages\" style=\"margin-left: 30px;\"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td rowspan=\"4\" valign=\"top\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/styles/layout/reply_arrow.gif\"&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td width=\"110\" align=\"left\" valign=\"top\" style=\"padding-top: 6px;\"&gt;&lt;a name=\"383578\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a class=\"dis_user_lnk\" href=\"/users/joseph-bullough/15930\"&gt;Joseph Bullough&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td valign=\"top\" style=\"padding-top: 6px;\"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Re: Directions not clear enough&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td align=\"right\" valign=\"top\" nowrap style=\"font-size: 10px;\"&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td valign=\"top\" rowspan=\"2\" align=\"left\" style=\"padding-top: 6px;\"&gt;&lt;p class=\"disc_avatar\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"/users/joseph-bullough/15930\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Joseph Bullough\" width=\"50\" height=\"50\" border=\"0\" src=\"/images/avatars/618932.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=\"font-size: 9px; color: #888;\"&gt;Hasn\'t voted&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td colspan=\"2\" style=\"padding-top: 6px;\"&gt;I added some additional info regarding the summit trail.

It has solid rock and some very enjoyable class 4 scrambling. Also, this is a great peak to do in combination with Basin Mountain and Four Gables.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;table border=\"1\" cellspacing=\"0\"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;  &lt;table border=\"0\" cellspacing=\"2\" cellpadding=\"2\"&gt;    &lt;tr bgcolor=\"#c0c0c0\"&gt;&lt;td colspan=\"5\"&gt;&lt;font style=\"font-weight:bold;\"&gt;ROUTES OVERVIEW&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;  &lt;tr&gt;  &lt;td align=\"center\"&gt;&lt;font style=\"font-weight:bold;\"&gt;Route&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/td&gt;  &lt;td align=\"center\"&gt;&lt;font style=\"font-weight:bold;\"&gt;Difficulty&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/td&gt;  &lt;td align=\"center\"&gt;&lt;font style=\"font-weight:bold;\"&gt;FA&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/td&gt;  &lt;td align=\"center\"&gt;&lt;font style=\"font-weight:bold;\"&gt;FA Party&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/td&gt;  &lt;td align=\"center\"&gt;&lt;font style=\"font-weight:bold;\"&gt;Photos&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/td&gt;    &lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;  &lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://www.summitpost.org/mountains/route_link.pl?route_id=4841&amp;amp;route_name=Northeast+Ridge&amp;amp;mountain_name=&amp;amp;object_id=4350&amp;amp;option=3&amp;amp;x=25&amp;amp;y=7\"&gt;Northeast Ridge&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;  &lt;td align=\"center\"&gt;cl. 4&lt;/td&gt;  &lt;td align=\"center\"&gt;1992&lt;/td&gt;  &lt;td&gt;Will Crjenko and Jim King&lt;/td&gt;  &lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://www.summitpost.org/mountains/photo_link.pl/photo_id/134738/mountain_id/4350/object_id/4350/type/mountain\"&gt;(1)&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"http://www.summitpost.org/mountains/photo_link.pl/p/photo_id__138727__object_id__4350__type__mountain__mountain_id__4350__route_id____user_id____order_by____limit__\"&gt;(2)&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"http://www.summitpost.org/mountains/photo_link.pl/p/photo_id__138728__object_id__4350__type__mountain__mountain_id__4350__route_id____user_id____order_by____limit__\"&gt;(3)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;    &lt;tr&gt;  &lt;td bgcolor=\"#e0e0e0\"&gt;Southwest Ridge&lt;/td&gt;  &lt;td bgcolor=\"#e0e0e0\" align=\"center\"&gt;cl. 3&lt;/td&gt;  &lt;td bgcolor=\"#e0e0e0\" align=\"center\"&gt;Sep 20, 1953&lt;/td&gt;  &lt;td bgcolor=\"#e0e0e0\"&gt;Barbara Lilley, John Wedberg, and Dick Woodward  &lt;/td&gt;  &lt;td bgcolor=\"#e0e0e0\"&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;    &lt;tr&gt;  &lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://www.summitpost.org/show/route_link.pl/route_id/4842/object_id/4350\"&gt;Horton Lakes &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;  &lt;td align=\"center\"&gt;cl. 2&lt;/td&gt;  &lt;td align=\"center\"&gt;1930&lt;/td&gt;  &lt;td&gt;Norman Clyde&lt;/td&gt;  &lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;  &lt;/table&gt;    &lt;i&gt;&lt;small&gt;First ascent information used from R.J.

From the east it is an imposing mountain, with a smooth wall of vertical cliffs stretching from the south end of the canyon to the north, almost like a giant dam. From the west the mountain is quite different, being nothing but a talus pile.  &lt;p&gt;  This peak offers some nice views of Bear Creek Spire, Tom, and Mt Humphreys from the summit, and the solitude and beauty of Horton Creek Canyon make this peak an enjoyable climb.  The eastiest route from the east is class 2, but the east face offers some technical climbs, such as the &lt;i&gt;The Beagle&lt;/i&gt; (IV, 5.9), and from the north one can attempt the &lt;i&gt;Northwest Ridge&lt;/i&gt; (V, Class 5).&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;    &lt;/p&gt;&lt;table border=\"1\" cellspacing=\"0\"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;  &lt;table border=\"0\" cellspacing=\"2\" cellpadding=\"2\"&gt;    &lt;tr bgcolor=\"#c0c0c0\"&gt;&lt;td colspan=\"5\"&gt;&lt;font style=\"font-weight:bold;\"&gt;ROUTES OVERVIEW&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;  &lt;tr&gt;  &lt;td align=\"center\"&gt;&lt;font style=\"font-weight:bold;\"&gt;Route&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/td&gt;  &lt;td align=\"center\"&gt;&lt;font style=\"font-weight:bold;\"&gt;Difficulty&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/td&gt;  &lt;td align=\"center\"&gt;&lt;font style=\"font-weight:bold;\"&gt;FA&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/td&gt;  &lt;td align=\"center\"&gt;&lt;font style=\"font-weight:bold;\"&gt;FA Party&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/td&gt;  &lt;td align=\"center\"&gt;&lt;font style=\"font-weight:bold;\"&gt;Photos&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/td&gt;    &lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr bgcolor=\"#c0c0c0\"&gt;&lt;td colspan=\"5\"&gt;&lt;font style=\"font-weight:bold;\"&gt;via Horton Lakes&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;    &lt;tr&gt;  &lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://www.summitpost.org/show/route_link.pl/route_id/4844/object_id/4352\"&gt;South Ridge&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;  &lt;td align=\"center\"&gt;cl. 2&lt;/td&gt;  &lt;td align=\"center\"&gt;1978&lt;/td&gt;  &lt;td&gt;Bill Bradley&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;    &lt;tr&gt;  &lt;td bgcolor=\"#e0e0e0\"&gt;North Ridge&lt;/td&gt;  &lt;td bgcolor=\"#e0e0e0\" align=\"center\"&gt;cl. 2&lt;/td&gt;  &lt;td bgcolor=\"#e0e0e0\" align=\"center\"&gt;1973&lt;/td&gt;  &lt;td bgcolor=\"#e0e0e0\"&gt;John Ripley, Fred Clements, John Halcomb, John Isaac, and Bruce Masson.&lt;/td&gt;  &lt;td bgcolor=\"#e0e0e0\"&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;    &lt;tr&gt;  &lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://www.summitpost.org/show/route_link.pl/route_id/4845/object_id/4352\"&gt;East Ridge&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;  &lt;td align=\"center\"&gt;cl. 3&lt;/td&gt;  &lt;td align=\"center\"&gt;1963&lt;/td&gt;  &lt;td&gt;Rick Jali&lt;/td&gt;  &lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://www.summitpost.org/mountains/photo_link.pl?photo_id=134815&amp;amp;object_id=4352&amp;amp;type=mountain&amp;amp;mountain_id=4352&amp;amp;route_id=4845\"&gt;(1)&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;a href=\"http://www.summitpost.org/mountains/photo_link.pl?photo_id=134817&amp;amp;object_id=4352&amp;amp;type=mountain&amp;amp;mountain_id=4352&amp;amp;route_id=4845\"&gt;(2)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;    &lt;tr&gt;  &lt;td bgcolor=\"#e0e0e0\"&gt;East Face, Left Side&lt;/td&gt;  &lt;td bgcolor=\"#e0e0e0\" align=\"center\"&gt;cl. 5&lt;/td&gt;  &lt;td bgcolor=\"#e0e0e0\" align=\"center\"&gt;1960&lt;/td&gt;  &lt;td bgcolor=\"#e0e0e0\"&gt;Harvey Hickman, Tom Sadler, Bob Weakley, and Rich Gnagy&lt;/td&gt;  &lt;td bgcolor=\"#e0e0e0\"&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;    &lt;tr&gt;  &lt;td&gt;Northwest Ridge&lt;/td&gt;  &lt;td align=\"center\"&gt;V, cl. 5&lt;/td&gt;  &lt;td align=\"center\"&gt;1991&lt;/td&gt;  &lt;td&gt;Will Crjenko, Andy Selters, and Claude Fiddler&lt;/td&gt;  &lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;    &lt;tr&gt;  &lt;td bgcolor=\"#e0e0e0\"&gt;Northeast Buttress&lt;/td&gt;  &lt;td bgcolor=\"#e0e0e0\" align=\"center\"&gt;II, 5.6&lt;/td&gt;  &lt;td bgcolor=\"#e0e0e0\" align=\"center\"&gt;1974&lt;/td&gt;  &lt;td bgcolor=\"#e0e0e0\"&gt;Fred Beckey and Mike Levine&lt;/td&gt;  &lt;td bgcolor=\"#e0e0e0\"&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;    &lt;tr&gt;  &lt;td&gt;East Face, Right Side&lt;/td&gt;  &lt;td align=\"center\"&gt;III, 5.8&lt;/td&gt;  &lt;td align=\"center\"&gt;1971&lt;/td&gt;  &lt;td&gt;Jeanne Neale and Galen Rowell&lt;/td&gt;  &lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;    &lt;tr&gt;  &lt;td bgcolor=\"#e0e0e0\"&gt;The Beagle&lt;/td&gt;  &lt;td bgcolor=\"#e0e0e0\" align=\"center\"&gt;IV, 5.9R&lt;/td&gt;  &lt;td bgcolor=\"#e0e0e0\" align=\"center\"&gt;1978&lt;/td&gt;  &lt;td bgcolor=\"#e0e0e0\"&gt;David Evans and Sibylle Hechtel&lt;/td&gt;  &lt;td bgcolor=\"#e0e0e0\"&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;    &lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;    &lt;tr bgcolor=\"#c0c0c0\"&gt;&lt;td colspan=\"5\"&gt;&lt;font style=\"font-weight:bold;\"&gt;via Piute Pass&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;    &lt;tr&gt;  &lt;td&gt;South Slope&lt;/td&gt;  &lt;td align=\"center\"&gt;cl. 2&lt;/td&gt;  &lt;td align=\"center\"&gt;1932&lt;/td&gt;  &lt;td&gt;Norman Clyde&lt;/td&gt;  &lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;    &lt;/table&gt;    &lt;i&gt;&lt;small&gt;First ascent information used from R.J.

Edith is located in the Bow River Valley just northwest of the town of Banff.  It was first ascended in 1900 by Collie and Stephens.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Mount Edith is an uplift of the Devonian age Palliser limestone, a 500 meter thick formation of solid rock.  There are four alpine rock routes on Edith and one scramble that can be varied from one peak to a traverse of all &lt;b&gt;three of it\'s summits&lt;/b&gt;, the highest being the northernmost.   It is a dogtooth mountain similar to &lt;i&gt;Mount Louis to the north (my favorite rock alpine climb in Banff NP)&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;table class=\"inline_image_thumbs\"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=108008\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/108008.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=108005\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/108005.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=108007\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/108007.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=108006\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/108006.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_2\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Getting There&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;a target=\"_top\" href=\"/mountains/photo_link.pl?photo_id=158353&amp;amp;object_id=280&amp;amp;type=mountain&amp;amp;mountain_id=280&amp;amp;route_id=\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"http://www.summitpost.com/images/thumb/107927.jpg\" alt=\"Tooltip for IE: Gamskofel\" title=\"Tooltip for Mozilla: Gamskofel\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br&gt;The Trans-Canada Highway dissects Banff National Park east to west as you come in from Calgary.  Bypass the Banff town exits and take the Bow Valley Parkway exit.  Follow the parkway for .3 km west to a road on your right, turn right and proceed to the Fireside Picnic area at the end of the road.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_3\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Red Tape&lt;/h2&gt;You will be required to purchase a national park pass as you enter the park.  This pass is good for all four national parks.  If you plan many visits to Canadian National Parks within one year, you should purchase an annual pass.  There are no permit requirements to climb in Banff National Park, but all camping is regulated.  There is also a backcountry permit required if you plan on spending a night in the backcountry versus the town campsites.  This can be obtained via the parks website which is included in the camping section below.  Park headquarters are located in Banff and you will drive through the manned kiosks as you enter the park.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This is active grizzly country, therefore, you should always have bear spray on your person.  We have had an increase in activity so far in 2005.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_4\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;When To Climb&lt;/h2&gt;It is best to climb Mount Edith from June through September.  There are no published or obvious backcountry ski routes on the mountain.  There are small ice routes located between Mount Cory and Edith.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_5\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Camping&lt;/h2&gt;You can go on line at &lt;a href=\"http://www.pc.gc.ca/pn-np/ab/banff/visit/visit4_e.asp\"&gt;Banff National Park&lt;/a&gt; to pick your camp site and obtain your camping permit.

Along with its neighbor &lt;a href=\"http://www.summitpost.org/mountains/mountain_link.pl?mountain_id=4950\"&gt;Edith&lt;/a&gt;, Cory is a popular ascent in &lt;b&gt;Banff National Park&lt;/b&gt;, one of four connecting national parks in the heart of the Canadian Rockies.   Two notable features distinguish Cory Mountain, a 300 meter vertical groove on its southwest face and a gaping, dark cave, also on the southwestern flank known as &lt;i&gt;&ldquo;Hole in the Wall&rdquo;&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Cory has a variety of routes listed below including a standard scramble.  The lower flanks offer several technically difficult sport climb routes on firm limestone, but none universally published as of this date.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;table class=\"inline_image_thumbs\"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=108556\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/108556.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=108555\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/108555.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=108553\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/108553.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=108552\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/108552.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=108557\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/108557.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_2\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Getting There&lt;/h2&gt;The Trans-Canada Highway dissects Banff National Park east to west as you come in from Calgary.  Bypass the Banff town exits and take the Bow Valley Parkway exit.  Turn right and follow the scenic parkway (90% of the time there are bull elk visible from the road) for 1.9 km.  Pull off to the right on a small shoulder good for  two to three vehicles.  It is imperative that you are at the right spot, as I went up the wrong rib on this mountain years ago and was forced to redo this route in 2005 to complete it.  There are several large ribs coming down from Mount Cory.  You want the eastern most rib which is identified as light-colored shaley cliffs with a deep ravine to its right.&lt;br&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_3\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Red Tape&lt;/h2&gt;You will be required to purchase a national park pass as you enter the park. This pass is good for all four national parks. If you plan many visits to Canadian National Parks within one year, you should purchase an annual pass. There are no permit requirements to climb in Banff National Park, but all camping is regulated. There is also a backcountry permit required if you plan on spending a night in the backcountry versus the town campsites. This can be obtained via the parks website which is included in the camping section below. Park headquarters are located in Banff and you will drive through the manned kiosks as you enter the park. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This is active grizzly country, therefore, you should always have bear spray on your person. We have had an increase in activity so far in 2005.&lt;br&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_4\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;When To Climb&lt;/h2&gt;If you want a dry scramble objective, it is best to climb Mount Cory from June through September.  &lt;b&gt;However, I climbed Cory in March with snowshoes, crampons and alpine ax and had a solid experience, although this does make for a more challenging objective.&lt;/b&gt;  There are no published or obvious backcountry ski routes on the mountain. There are small ice climbing routes located between Mount Cory and Edith.&lt;br&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_5\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Camping&lt;/h2&gt;You can go on line at &lt;a href=\"http://www.pc.gc.ca/pn-np/ab/banff/visit/visit4_e.asp\"&gt;Banff National Park&lt;/a&gt; to pick your camp site and obtain your camping permit.

Additional nine miles of driving brings you to the highest trailhead in East Sierra, Mosquito Flat,  at 10200 feet. From the trailhead to the Long lake is a 2-mile scenic hike along the trough of the Little Lakes Valley that bring you pass four beautiful lakes, with little elevation gain or loss. From Long Lake, hike along its right shore to reach the opposite side of the lake. From here you can either ascend the glacier-carved valley until you reach Teasure Lakes, or stay a little bit high on the right side of the canyon, hiking up two short, gentle slope. The route many take is to stay high on the right until you reach the two small lakes of the Teasure lakes, hike around them and ascend another slope to reach the bottom of the &lt;a href=\"http://www.summitpost.org/show/route_link.pl/route_id/244/object_id/486\"&gt;Hourglass Couloir&lt;/a&gt; surrounded by a nice cirque. Slag up the 40-degree couloir to reach the saddle between Mt. Dade and Pipsqueak. Here you will find a hidden lake resides in a high cirque formed by Mt. Dade, Pipsqueak, and the connecting spires and ridges. From here, climb up the class2/3 north slope. A more aesthetic way to do it is to veer off to the left when you reach the upper 1/3 of the Hourglass couloir and climb along the edge of the sheer east wall of Pipsqueak and then ascend along the east ridge of the Pipsqueak.&lt;br&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_3\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Red Tape&lt;/h2&gt;Little Lakes Valley is a very popular dayhike/backpacking starting point. Weekend permits are difficult to obtain during summer months, once the road is open to the trailhead. All three peaks mentioned above can be done as a reasonabe dayhike though.&lt;br&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_4\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;When To Climb&lt;/h2&gt;In spring, when the high lakes are frozen and the slope well-covered by snow, this is a fine ski mountaineering area. You can descend 3000+ feet to the lower lakes. Summer months bring typical rock scrambling to the ascend. To do it in winter, several miles of hiking up may be required.&lt;br&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_5\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Camping&lt;/h2&gt;Many camping site along the road up the Rock Creek Valley ($16); Mosquito Plat has some camping spaces that is limited to one-night usage.

Some camps low along the road to get out of the mosquito-fested area; acclimatization also is one factor to consider when choosing a camping site.&lt;br&gt;The Rock Creek Lake Resort provides services for token-operated hot-water shower, grocery, fishing equipment rental, and delicious chili, burger, and yes, Sue\'s famous pies.&lt;br&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_6\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Mountain Conditions&lt;/h2&gt;Check Rock Creek Lake Resort\'s website for winter/spring condition, road closure, area weather, and many other tips.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://members.boardhost.com/rockcreek/\"&gt;Rock Creek message board&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div align=\"center\"&gt;&lt;a name=\"messages\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_7\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Additions and Corrections&lt;/h2&gt;[ &lt;a href=\"/object_discussion.php?type=vote_comments&amp;amp;object_id=154274&amp;amp;is_addition=1#vote_form\"&gt;Post an Addition or Correction&lt;/a&gt;

It\'s lower elevation and relative remoteness cause it to see less than a dozen visitors a year. \"The mountain was named for George Cedric Wright (1889-1959), an internationally known photographer whose photography has made a significant contribution to the appreciation of the natural scene(from the USGS website).\" Wright was one of the first High Sierra photographers, following in the footsteps of John Muir. His works can be viewed in his book &lt;a href=\"http://www.wildnesswithin.com/hum2.html\"&gt;Words of the Earth&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br&gt;The mountain itself is not technically difficult, easy class 2 by the normal route.  The approach on the other hand is truly a journey and a half. Either via the Sawmill Pass Trail or Armstrong Canyon, both require large amounts of elevation gain.  Cedric Wright sits high above the Woods Creek drainage, giving it beautiful views North, West, and South. &lt;br&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_2\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Getting There&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;br&gt;Cedric Wright is bordered to the North by the Pinchot Pass basin and to the South by the upper Woods Creek drainage. The most common approaches to the Mountain are via the Sawmill Pass Trail and a traverse over Colosseum Mt from Armstrong Canyon.&lt;br&gt;The Sawmill Pass Trail is the more common path, because it is the least technical. To reach the trail head take Highway 395 to Black Rock Spring Road 8 miles North of Independence. Turn West on Black Rock Springs and follow it until it dead ends on Tinemaha Rd, turn right(North) here.  After another 2 miles you\'ll take a left onto Division Creek Rd, drive up past the Powerhouse and to the trail head turnout on the left hand side. The road continues past the trail head up into Armstrong Canyon, those wishing to take the Armstrong Canyon approach can continue up the road, though a 4wd is recommended to fully utilize this road.&lt;br&gt;The Sawmill Pass Trail starts at a brutal 4650ft and climbs relentlessly for 10 miles to Sawmill Pass. Prepare for an early start, since summer temps can peak 100 degrees in the valley and there is no water until one reaches the shaded \"Hogsback\" in Sawmill Canyon. Once in the canyon the trail climbs through mostly forested slopes to Sawmill Pass at 11347ft. From there it is an easy cross country hike North across the basin to the mountain.&lt;br&gt;For those climbing up Armstrong Canyon, continue up the road until you can/don\'t want to drive any further. Most cars can make at least Scotty Springs at 5800ft. Start hiking from where you parked up the Canyon. It is relatively easy cross country until you reach the head of the canyon and Class 3 Armstrong Col. Once at the top of the Col you have a choice of following the ridge line over Colosseum Mt or dropping into the basin to the SW. These routes all require more route finding and are more technically challenging.(See the &lt;a href=\"http://www.summitpost.org/mountains/display_component.pl?type=component&amp;amp;mountain_id=5220&amp;amp;route_id=&amp;amp;component_id=64802&amp;amp;object_id=64802\"&gt;View  More Info&lt;/a&gt; section for more on this route)&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;table class=\"inline_image_thumbs\"&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=115935\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/115935.JPG\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=115936\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/115936.JPG\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_3\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Red Tape&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;br&gt;Sawmill Pass lies within the Bighorn Sheep Zoological region. The area 1 mile directly North of the pass and the basin South of the pass are off limits half the year, check with the forest service for dates(I believe July 16-Dec15).&lt;br&gt;Most people will do this peak as an overnight hike up the Sawmill Pass Trail. Any overnight stay in the wilderness requires an overnight permit from the &lt;a href=\"http://www.fs.fed.us/r5/inyo/\"&gt;Inyo NF&lt;/a&gt;. Permits are free for walk-ins or can be reserved for $5 a person. Currently one can still request an after hours pickup, which is recommended so one can start at dawn and avoid the heat. Day hikes do not require a permit, though on the most fit should ever attempt to day hike this peak.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Letter from the Inyo NF regarding Night Drop Box Permits&lt;br&gt;\"After due consideration, the management of Sequoia and Kings Canyon National Parks is requesting that the Inyo National Forest implement a change in how wilderness permits are issued to those individuals and groups who camp in the parks. We are requesting that night drop boxes no longer be used and that all permits which include camping in these parks be issued in person. This action will be phased in throughout 2005 and fully in-place in 2006. The primary reason for this change is to more adequately protect wilderness resources in the parks.\"&lt;br&gt;National Park Service May 2005&lt;br&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_4\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;When To Climb&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;br&gt;The peak is most commonly climbed between June and October. Though several winter ascents have been registered as part of ski tours across the Sierra. Before June an ice axe and crampons would be required for both the approaches and the actual peak itself. &lt;br&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_5\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Camping&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;br&gt;Camping is allowed anywhere in the basin North of Woods Lake. The area South of the Pass around Mt Baxter is off limits half of the year due to Bighorn Sheep restrictions.&lt;div align=\"center\"&gt;&lt;a name=\"messages\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_6\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Additions and Corrections&lt;/h2&gt;[ &lt;a href=\"/object_discussion.php?type=vote_comments&amp;amp;object_id=154375&amp;amp;is_addition=1#vote_form\"&gt;Post an Addition or Correction&lt;/a&gt; ]&lt;table cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" style=\"width: 775px;\"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;table cellpadding=\"2\" cellspacing=\"2\" width=\"100%\"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;&lt;span class=\"pagertext\"&gt;Viewing: &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;-&lt;b&gt;3&lt;/b&gt; of &lt;b&gt;3&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td align=\"center\"&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td align=\"right\"&gt;    &lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;table border=\"0\" width=\"775\" class=\"messages\"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td width=\"110\" align=\"left\" valign=\"top\" style=\"padding-top: 6px;\"&gt;&lt;a name=\"121313\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a class=\"dis_user_lnk\" href=\"/users/matthew-holliman/10534\"&gt;Matthew Holliman&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td valign=\"top\" style=\"padding-top: 6px;\"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Untitled Comment&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td align=\"right\" valign=\"top\" nowrap style=\"font-size: 10px;\"&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td valign=\"top\" rowspan=\"2\" align=\"left\" style=\"padding-top: 6px;\"&gt;&lt;p class=\"disc_avatar\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"/users/matthew-holliman/10534\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Matthew Holliman\" width=\"50\" height=\"50\" border=\"0\" src=\"/images/avatars/14489.JPG\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=\"font-size: 9px; color: #888;\"&gt;Voted 10/10&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td colspan=\"2\" style=\"padding-top: 6px;\"&gt;Eric--Your notes seem fine to me.  I have a description of the drive/TH approach on the &lt;a href=\"http://www.summitpost.org/mountains/mountain_link.pl?mountain_id=4859%22\"&gt;Eastern Sierra logistical page&lt;/a&gt; which you can plagiarise or link to.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r&lt;br&gt;From the end of the road, if you follow the use trail up the canyon to the bowl below Mt. Perkins, there are two options:  head left (south) to a snow-filled couloir that leads up to what I believe is Armstrong Col, or right (north) and then follow the Sierra Crest south, tagging Mt. Perkins along the way.  Armstrong Col requires axe/crampons, but the approach via Mt. Perkins melts out very early (leaving a thoroughly unpleasant sand climb behind in order to reach the crest).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r&lt;br&gt;Either way, the best way to Mt. Cedric Wright from Armstrong Col is to continue south along the Sierra Crest to Colosseum (exposed class 3) and then descend Colosseum\'s sandy west ridge to the saddle.  It\'s possible to descend the sandy southwest side of Armstrong Col to the basin west of Colosseum, from where Colosseum Col (the Colosseum-Cedric Wright saddle) is reached trivially--but it seems silly to bypass Colosseum, especially as its north ridge is a nice climb and it doesn\'t involve much extra elevation gain vs. dropping down into the basin.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r&lt;br&gt;By the way, I believe there\'s an error in Secor\'s 2nd ed., in which he says the col is 0.8mi north of Colosseum; it makes more sense that Armstrong Col is 0.8mi NW of Colosseum Mtn.  (This seems to correspond to what looked like a snow couloir from Armstrong Canyon and easy slopes to the SW, and the elevation on my maps at this point is roughly consistent with his stats for the pass).  None of my maps have a point \"Peak 3705m\" on them, which he uses as a landmark to identify the col\'s location.&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td valign=\"bottom\" style=\"padding-top: 6px;\" colspan=\"2\"&gt;&lt;span style=\"font-size: 9px; color: #888;\"&gt;Posted Jul 25, 2005 7:52 pm&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;table border=\"0\" width=\"775\" class=\"messages\"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td width=\"110\" align=\"left\" valign=\"top\" style=\"padding-top: 6px;\"&gt;&lt;a name=\"495411\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a class=\"dis_user_lnk\" href=\"/users/steventhaw/33134\"&gt;StevenThaw&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td valign=\"top\" style=\"padding-top: 6px;\"&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIERRA (not sierras)&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td align=\"right\" valign=\"top\" nowrap style=\"font-size: 10px;\"&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td valign=\"top\" rowspan=\"2\" align=\"left\" style=\"padding-top: 6px;\"&gt;&lt;p class=\"disc_avatar\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"/users/steventhaw/33134\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"StevenThaw\" width=\"50\" height=\"50\" border=\"0\" src=\"/images/avatars/701367.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=\"font-size: 9px; color: #888;\"&gt;Hasn\'t voted&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td colspan=\"2\" style=\"padding-top: 6px;\"&gt;The SIERRA is one mountain range.

Because of the large number of outstanding peaks in this area, this one falls low on the list for most climbers, and is climbed no more than a few times each year judging from the register entries.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Popularity aside, this peak is a fine climb in its own right. The North Ridge is a very fine class 4 scramble, and the views from the summit outstanding. For anyone making the daunting Mono-Morgan Pass traverse, this is the last peak traversed before descending to Morgan Pass. There are two summits to this peak, separated by a class 3 ridge. The higher north summit has the spot elevation shown on the map and is the point described by Secor.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Little Lakes area is one of the finest and densest peak climbing areas in the Sierra, and is well represented here on SummitPost. Nearby peaks viewable from the summit of Rosy Finch are &lt;a href=\"http://www.summitpost.org/mountains/mountain_link.pl?mountain_id=4124\"&gt;Wheeler Peak&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"http://www.summitpost.org/show/mountain_link.pl/mountain_id/1462\"&gt;Mt. Morgan (S)&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"http://www.summitpost.org/show/mountain_link.pl/mountain_id/1522\"&gt;Pyramid Peak&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"http://www.summitpost.org/show/mountain_link.pl/mountain_id/494\"&gt;Bear Creek Spire&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"http://www.summitpost.org/show/mountain_link.pl/mountain_id/5085\"&gt;Pipsqueak Spire&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"http://www.summitpost.org/show/mountain_link.pl/mountain_id/486\"&gt;Mt.

Mills&lt;/a&gt;, Ruby Peak, and &lt;a href=\"http://www.summitpost.org/show/mountain_link.pl/mountain_id/1293\"&gt;Mt. Starr&lt;/a&gt;. In addition there is a great view into the Humpreys Basin to the south and the array of peaks surrounding it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The name is likely derived from Finch Lake, located at 10,700ft in a small cirque about 3/4mi east of the summit. There is a Rosy Finch Lake located about 10 miles to the northwest near Mt. Izaak Walton and the Silver Divide, but it is unlikely the naming was related.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Route Overview&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;In addition to the class 4 North Ridge, the Southeast Slopes from Finch Lake are class 2, the East Ridge and the traverse from Pyramid Peak are class 3. There are also tedious scree chutes on the northeast side from Upper Morgan Lake that are class 2-3. The west side is quite steep, but looks to have interesting class 3-4 options as well.&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;table class=\"inline_image_thumbs\"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=116134\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/116134.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=116132\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/116132.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=116133\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/116133.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_2\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Getting There&lt;/h2&gt;Rosy Finch Peak is most easily reached from the Rock Creek area. From US395, take the Rock Creek Rd turnoff and drive 9 miles to the road\'s end at Mosquito Flat. At 10,200ft, this is the highest TH in the Sierra. Follow the trail south for 3.5mi to Morgan Pass (11,080ft). This is one of the most beautiful trails in the Sierra, passing by many alpine lakes, abundant wildflowers and impressive snow-capped peaks.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Alternatively, Morgan Pass and Rosy Finch Peak can be reach from the Pine Creek area. The Pine Creek Rd meets US395 about 10mi northwest of Bishop. Follow the road through the small community of Rovana for 10mi, past the Pine Creek TH to the end of the drivable road at the Tungsten Mine (7,880ft). Follow the road, turning to trail, for 5.1mi to Morgan Pass. Note that this alternative is longer, significantly more elevation gain, and frankly dull and tedious compared to the approach through Little Lakes Valley. The section passing by Upper and Lower Morgan Lakes is the most pleasant.&lt;br&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_3\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Red Tape &amp;amp; Mountain Conditions&lt;/h2&gt;Rosy Finch Peak and the surrounding area lies in the John Muir Wilderness. Backcountry permits are required for overnight visits to the area. Permits are free if you pick them up in person at the Ranger Station.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Everything you need to know about conditions, permits and regulations can be found on the &lt;a href=\"http://www.summitpost.org/show/mountain_link.pl/mountain_id/4859\"&gt;Eastern Sierra - Logisitcal Center&lt;/a&gt; page.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Note that the tungsten mine on Pine Creek is in active (though barely) operation and privately owned, and should be properly respected.&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://www.fs.fed.us/r5/inyo/vc/mammoth.html\"&gt;Mammoth Lakes Ranger Station&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://www.fs.fed.us/r5/inyo/vc/wmrs.html\"&gt;White Mountain Ranger Station&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;798 North Main Street&lt;br&gt;Bishop, CA  93514&lt;br&gt;760-873-2500&lt;br&gt;760-873-2501 (TDD)&lt;br&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_4\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Camping&lt;/h2&gt;Overnight camping in the surrounding areas of the John Muir Wilderness is allowed with proper permits (see the &lt;b&gt;Red Tape&lt;/b&gt; section). There are plenty of fine camping opportunities in the Little Lakes Valley. Near to the peak are excellent sites at Chickenfoot and Gem Lakes. This area is &lt;i&gt;very&lt;/i&gt; popular and permits are in high demand. It is unlikely you will find much solitude in the summer months, but the views will compensate for your troubles. There are also decent camping spots, far less popular, in the Morgan Lakes area east of Morgan Pass.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Alternatively, consider climbing this as a relatively easy dayhike. The approach is quite short and all on trail.&lt;br&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_5\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;External Links&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://www.snwburd.com/bob/trip_reports/rosy_finch_1.html\"&gt;A sunrise climb - July 8, 2004&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;                                                                                    &lt;a name=\"chapter_6\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Images&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div align=\"center\"&gt;&lt;table id=\"my_images\"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/edge-on-rosy-n-ridge/547563/c-154383\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Edge on Rosy N Ridge\" src=\"/images/square/547563.JPG\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/loose-chute/336071/c-154383\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Loose Chute\" src=\"/images/square/336071.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/several-options-available-on/116135/c-154383\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Several options available on...\" src=\"/images/square/116135.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view-south-into-pine-creek/116134/c-154383\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"View south into Pine Creek...\" src=\"/images/square/116134.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/chickenfoot-lake/501438/c-154383\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Chickenfoot Lake..\" src=\"/images/square/501438.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/rosey-finch-and-pyramid-peaks-from-chickenfoot-lake/555902/c-154383\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Rosey Finch and Pyramid Peaks from Chickenfoot Lake\" src=\"/images/square/555902.JPG\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/north-face/615820/c-154383\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"North Face\" src=\"/images/square/615820.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/rosy-finch-peak-from-just/116132/c-154383\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Rosy Finch Peak from just...\" src=\"/images/square/116132.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/rosy-finch-n-ridge-w-ridge-photo-topo/667423/c-154383\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Rosy Finch N Ridge &amp;amp; W Ridge (Photo Topo)\" src=\"/images/square/667423.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/rosy-finch-peak-traverse-to-pyramid-peak-photo-topo/667425/c-154383\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Rosy Finch Peak &amp;amp; Traverse to Pyramid Peak (Photo Topo)\" src=\"/images/square/667425.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/the-view-north-into-little/116133/c-154383\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"The view north into Little...\" src=\"/images/square/116133.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/from-chickenfoot-lake/672051/c-154383\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"from Chickenfoot Lake\" src=\"/images/square/672051.JPG\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/rosy-finch-s-north-side-from-morgan-lakes/890244/c-154383\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Rosy Finch\\\'s North Side from Morgan Lakes\" src=\"/images/square/890244.JPG\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/rosy-finch-peak-from-the/122232/c-154383\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Rosy Finch Peak from the...\" src=\"/images/square/122232.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/article&gt;date:difficulty:'),(142,154659,'/mount-robinson/154659','/palisades/171074','Mount Robinson','','','','12967','',12401,37.1179,-118.516,'California, United States, North America','','',171074,'Palisades','','','','','','Mountain-Rock','content: &lt;article&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_1\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2 id=\"first_h2\"&gt;Overview&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;br&gt;Mount Robinson is located just north of the prominent palisade peaks which are the envy of many a California mountaineer. Robinson is easily seen from the frequently traveled N. Fork of Big Pine Creek trail and camping spots near the Palisade Glacier. Even though there are relatively easy routes on Mt. Robinson, because it is located amongst other more popular mountains (including five fourteeners) it is seldom climbed. Yet for those who endure the long approach across infrequently visited areas of the Inyo wilderness, the summit of Robinson offers spectacular views of the Palisades to the south and Sam Mack Lake to the East.&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;table class=\"inline_image_thumbs\"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=126029\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/126029.JPG\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=125939\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/125939.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=127064\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/127064.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_2\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Approach and Routes&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mt. Robinson generally can be approached from either the Bishop Pass or the North Fork of Big Pine Creek trailheads. If following up the N. Fork, stay the trail to Sam Mack Meadow at which point split off and follow up to Sam Mack Lake; here one can ascend the class 2 SE slope. If coming from the north (Bishop Pass), one must gain Agassiz Col and traverse around Mt. Agassiz to reach the base of Mt. Robinson. This puts one in position to climb the more difficult west ridge.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;Alternatively, if climbing other prominent peaks which line the area, Mt. Robinson can also be approached from a base camp near the Palisade glacier. The route leads one along the rarely traveled East sides of Mnts Winchell and Agassiz and offers great views of the glacier lakes and streams.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;Some routes are outlined in the following table:&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;table border=\"1\"&gt;  &lt;tr&gt;    &lt;td&gt;&lt;b&gt;route&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/td&gt;    &lt;td&gt;&lt;b&gt;first ascent&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/td&gt;    &lt;td&gt;&lt;b&gt;brief info&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/td&gt;  &lt;/tr&gt;  &lt;tr&gt;    &lt;td&gt;NE Face&lt;/td&gt;    &lt;td&gt;Class 3&lt;/td&gt;    &lt;td&gt;First ascent by Norman Clyde in 1930&lt;/td&gt;  &lt;/tr&gt;  &lt;tr&gt;    &lt;td&gt;W Ridge&lt;/td&gt;    &lt;td&gt;Class 3&lt;/td&gt;    &lt;td&gt;First ascent by Brower &amp;amp; Voge in 1934. route finding makes it very difficult to maintain class 3 along the ridge; be prepared for class 4 and possibly mid class 5 climbing to reach the summit.&lt;/td&gt;  &lt;/tr&gt;  &lt;tr&gt;    &lt;td&gt;South Face&lt;/td&gt;    &lt;td&gt;5.7&lt;/td&gt;    &lt;td&gt;First ascent by Roper, Clark, Lonne, &amp;amp; James in \'68.

To climb, you can follow any of the chutes on the SE side. Many of them look like nice class 3 fun.&lt;/td&gt;  &lt;/tr&gt;  &lt;/table&gt;    &lt;br&gt;The easiest routes on this mountains are the SE slopes and the NE face. The long ramping west ridge looks quite inviting and Secor rates it as class 3; yet in reality one would have a difficult time climbing this ridge and keeping it to class 3 as there are many sections along the ridge that are strict class 4 moves. Mid class 5 rock routes also exists on both the north and south sides of the mountain. For more detailed information on the established routes up Robinson refer to Secor\'s &lt;i&gt;High Sierra Peaks Passes and Trails&lt;/i&gt;).&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;table class=\"inline_image_thumbs\"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=125941\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/125941.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=127063\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/127063.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_3\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Red Tape&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;br&gt;All over night traffic in both the Inyo Nation Forest and Kings Canyon National Park require a wilderness permit.

Walk in permits (if available) are free; day hikers/climbers require no permit. If going in winter, one can self issue a permit at either Ranger station prior to entering the wilderness.

Thousands of people visit this summit every day from December to April; it is the home to the terminus of the Snowbird Tram.  Although Hidden Peak does not have much prominance, it is the easiest of Utah\'s 10K+ peaks to summit - all that it requires is a large chunk of &lt;a href=\"//www.snowbird.com/events/summeractivities/tram.html\"&gt;spare change&lt;/a&gt; in the summertime and a ski pass in the winter.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Lately, there has been a lot of controversy over the future of (what\'s left of) Hidden Peak. See the &lt;a href=\"http://www.summitpost.org/view_object.php?object_id=191302&amp;amp;confirm_post=7#chapter_5\"&gt;History section&lt;/a&gt; for more information and weblinks.&lt;br&gt;&lt;div align=\"center\" class=\"image-left\" style=\"width: 206px;\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"/july-21-2004-albion-basin/61853\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"July 21, 2004 - Albion Basin...\" height=\"150\" width=\"200\" src=\"/images/small/61853.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=\"caption\"&gt;Hidden Peak\'s hidden peak&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br&gt;As far as climbing &amp;amp; hiking excitement go, Hidden Peak is down at the bottom of the list for those who understand what the Wasatch mountains hold in store. This is because there are two (three now?) dirt roads and a tram leading to the summit. However, it does offer great views of the Little Cottonwood Canyon, upper American Fork Canyon, the Cottonwood Ridge, the Alpine Ridge, the Salt Lake Valley below, and the Oquirrh mountains in the distance.  What makes this peak unique in the Wasatch is that anyone can reach the summit (via the Tram) - including the elderly and the mobility challenged.  This is both good and bad -- it is good because it offers a taste of the glory of the mountains to many who would never otherwise get to a summit, but it is bad because the Tram and all of it\'s structures are an eyesore - to put it mildly.  At least the Tram terminates on &lt;b&gt;Hidden&lt;/b&gt; Peak, where as the name suggests - it is [somewhat] hidden.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Sometime around the late-90s, Snowbird began hosting summer ORV (4-wheeler &amp;amp; motorcycle) tours in their ski area. The author is not sure if ORV-ing is allowed in Peruvian Gulch and Gad Valley (it is allowed Mineral Basin), but he suspects so. This is bad news for those who unknowingly come to the area for tranquility. Fortunately, Snowbird is the only place in Little Cottonwood canyon where such vehicles are allowed, and one needs to drive only a few minutes up-canyon or down-canyon to find another area that will offer peace and quiet.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Overall, the Hidden Peak area is a nice place for a family with young kids, or to take Grandma &amp;amp; Grandpa to (there is even a nearly level, &lt;i&gt;paved&lt;/i&gt; trail, leading to a viewing platform at the base of the mountain. The &lt;a href=\"http://www.summitpost.org/area/range/171209/wasatch-range-central.html\"&gt;Wasatch Mountains&lt;/a&gt; hold many more pristine areas, however, and you should be aware of that.&lt;a name=\"chapter_2\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Getting There&lt;/h2&gt;Hidden Peak is on the &lt;a href=\"http://www.summitpost.org/area/range/171206/wasatch-alpine-ridge.html\"&gt;Alpine Ridge&lt;/a&gt;, and is near the end of &lt;a href=\"http://www.summitpost.org/canyon/154313/little-cottonwood-canyon.html\"&gt;Little Cottonwood Canyon&lt;/a&gt;, east of the Salt Lake Valley.  For directions to Little Cottonwood Canyon, composed by Snowbird resort, click &lt;a href=\"//www.snowbird.com/imagelib/meetings/DirectionsToSnowbird.pdf\"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For an alternate approach through American Fork Canyon, see the &lt;a href=\"//www.summitpost.org/route/191792/american-fork-canyon-mineral-basin.html\"&gt;route page&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;a name=\"chapter_3\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Red Tape&lt;/h2&gt;No passes or permits required to access the area or hike to the top. Parking may be the only piece of red tape. There is usually plenty of parking, but there are parking restrictions - be sure to follow the rules or you might get ticketed.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In the past, Snowbird used to offer free tram rides from the summit down, but they no longer do this. However, one might be able to talk the operator into it, or just sneak on - if you don\'t look too conspicuous among the tourists.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Also, because Little Cottonwood Canyon is a watershed, &lt;b&gt;no domesticated animals&lt;/b&gt; are allowed in the canyon.  &lt;a name=\"chapter_4\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Camping&lt;/h2&gt;There are &lt;a href=\"//www.fs.fed.us/r4/wcnf/unit/slrd/recreation/camping/little_cottonwood_canyon_cg.shtml\"&gt;two campgrounds&lt;/a&gt; in Little Cottonwood Canyon called Tanner\'s Flat (in mid-canyon) and Albion Basin (in Alta, at the end of the canyon).  There are not many other spots to camp near the canyon bottom.  You must hike up away from the highway to find other spots to camp.  The area north of Hidden Peak is almost exclusively day-use.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;On the American Fork Canyon side, unorganized camping sites are abundant. But be aware that the area is very popular to motorized off-road vehicles.&lt;br&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_5\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Recent History&lt;/h2&gt;The following information is current as of May 2006.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In the last few decades, there has been a lot of action on Hidden Peak - particularly in the last decade. Snowbird is planning to build a 50,000 sq. ft. structure that will contain: a convention center / 2 restaurants / a bar / and a &lt;i&gt;theater&lt;/i&gt;. A local conservation group in Salt Lake City, SAVE OUR CANYONS (SOC) sued the USFS in an attempt to prevent the structure, or at least decrease it\'s size and impact. Snowbird did decrease it\'s size from the original plans of 78,000 sq. ft., but unfortunately, SOC eventually lost their court battles, and it looks like it will be built. For a more comprehensive report on the subject and other topics, follow this link: &lt;a href=\"//www.saveourcanyons.org/archive/business/snowbird.html\"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Save Our Canyons&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. For an intersting map (for all of you cartographiles out there) of &lt;b&gt;where the convention center will be visible from&lt;/b&gt;, click &lt;a href=\"//www.saveourcanyons.org/archive/business/visibility.html\"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. However, the latest information that the author could find is that this structure is on hold. If someone out there knows more about this, please add it to \"Additions/Correction\" and I will update this page.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Although SOC was not able to stop the mountain-top center, SOC has had some success. One thing they were able to do  was stop Snowbird\'s planned expasion westward - into White Pine Canyon, a popular backcounty area.  White Pine Canyon borders the Lone Peak Wilderness area (Utah\'s first, and arguably finest, wilderness area), and SOC effectively argued that the wilderness area needs a buffer zone, and Snowbird was forced to abandon its westward expansion plans.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In a seemingly reactionary response, Snowbird pursued plans to expand its operations into American Fork Canyon, in an area known as Mineral Basin. This, of course, was very controversial, and SOC sued again, but Snowbird prevailed. Now there are two high-speed quad lifts in Mineral Basin and many ski runs.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div align=\"center\" class=\"image-left\" style=\"width: 206px;\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"/peruvian-gulch-tunnel/192509\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Peruvian Gulch Tunnel\" height=\"143\" width=\"200\" src=\"/images/small/192509.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=\"caption\"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div align=\"center\" class=\"image-right\" style=\"width: 206px;\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"/ouch/192511\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"OUCH\" height=\"135\" width=\"200\" src=\"/images/small/192511.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=\"caption\"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br&gt;Also, to provide better access to Mineral Basin, Snowbird is drilling &lt;a href=\"//www.snowbird.com/about/construction/peruvian.html\"&gt;&lt;b&gt;a tunnel&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt; from Peruvian Gulch to Mineral Basin. This will further scar the mountainsides, but at least Snowbird did not terminate another lift on a ridgeline. The tunnel will by 12 ft. wide by 10 ft. tall, and will house a one-way people mover (like in airports) to convey skiers southbound - from Peruvian Gulch to Mineral Basin. This kind of tunnel is unique in the United States, and carries some interest in that respect, but at what cost?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As Snowbird continues to evolve and grow, it is terrific that there are people out there (like SOC) to scrutinize and stand up to the man.

It has a beautiful view and it is an SPS list peak. It\'s easy class 2 from the southwest. The SPS calls it a class 1 peak - I suppose it\'s as \'class 1\' as Mt. Langley is - pick you route, walk slowly, and you could keep your hands in your pockets the whole way.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_2\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Which Summit?&lt;/h4&gt; &lt;div align=\"center\" class=\"image-left\" style=\"width: 167px;\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"/true-summit/830626\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"True Summit\" height=\"200\" width=\"161\" src=\"/images/small/830626.png\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=\"caption\"&gt;&lt;b&gt;12473&lt;/b&gt;, NOT 12450&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;The &lt;b&gt;correct&lt;/b&gt; summit is  the western one - it is 22 feet higher, and has the summit register, while the eastern summit shows a &lt;i&gt;vertical control point&lt;/i&gt; (X) on the 7.5 minute USGS topo labeled &lt;i&gt;3794.9&lt;/i&gt; (meters). I climbed the wrong summit first (because I had downloaded a waypoint placed there), and then the right one. Pictures I took of each summit from the other one indicate that the western summit is higher. I suppose that the eastern summit, having a better view of the Owens Valley, served the purposes of the surveyors better, so it got the vertical control point and the \"X\" on the map. The 2 summits are only about 10 minutes apart, so climb both!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_3\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h4&gt;What Elevation?&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Elevation 12473 is shown on the &lt;a href=\"http://langenbacher.org/Maps/USGS_GeoPDF/CA_Mt.%20Pinchot_298311_1953_62500_geo(15Minute).pdf\"&gt;Mt. Pinchot USGS 15 minute quadrangle&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"http://angeles.sierraclub.org/sps/SPSPkXlsht.htm\"&gt;SPS peaks list&lt;/a&gt; and many other references show the elevation as 12,451 ft., or 3795 meters - obviously derived from the eastern summit elevation. The western summit is clearly higher when viewed from the eastern summit.&lt;a name=\"chapter_4\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Getting There&lt;/h2&gt;Most quickly approached from the east via Sawmill Pass or Armstrong Canyon. Drive in on US 395 between Independence and Big Pine. For driving instructions to Sawmill Pass or Armstrong Canyon, see &lt;a href=\"http://www.climber.org/DrivingDirections/sawmill.html\"&gt;http://www.climber.org/DrivingDirections/sawmill.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;From Sawmill or Armstrong, go to \"Colosseum Col\" west of the summit for a class 1 ascent up Colosseum\'s west ridge. There are several class 2-3 shortcuts up from the valleys north and south of Colosseum Col.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The north ridge (from Armstrong Col) is variously described as class 3 by Secor, class 4 \"generally chosen in error\" by Voge-Smatko, class 4 by Roper, class 3-4 by Matthew, and \"nasty\" or \"really nasty\" by Nile. See Nile\'s detailed &lt;a href=\"http://www.climber.org/TripReports/2007/1580.html\"&gt;report at climber.org&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Sawmill Pass is one of the best kept secrets of the Eastern Sierra. We met a guy named Don camped at the beautiful Sawmill Meadow who said it was his 45th year in a row coming there(!!!) and he almost never saw anybody there in May. Sawmill Lake is a magnificent place to camp and fish. Then, just over the pass you can see the lovely Woods Lake. What keeps the secret so well is the first 4 miles of trail. It starts out going through dry brush and cactus at about 4500 ft. elevation. We had no trouble starting out at 1030 am on an unusually cold Memorial Day weekend, but Kathy says starting at 5 am in June was too late to avoid the heat and misery of going uphill on a sandy trail with no water for so long. After that, it\'s glorious ( at least it is in a wet spring season). Some places, grass is growing in the middle of the trail, which to me, is a rare and treasured sign of the peace and solitude to be found there. I hope it stays that way.&lt;br&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_5\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Red Tape&lt;/h2&gt;A wilderness permit is required for overnight travel in this area.&lt;br&gt;There may be restrictions due to the Sierra Nevada Bighorn Sheep. Dogs are not allowed. Info on permits is given at &lt;a href=\"http://www.fs.fed.us/r5/inyo/recreation/wild/otheravail.shtml\"&gt;&lt;br&gt;http://www.fs.fed.us/r5/inyo/recreation/wild/otheravail.shtml&lt;/a&gt;. Trail quota is 10 per day at Sawmill Pass Trail, see JOHN MUIR WILDERNESS at the &lt;a href=\"http://www.fs.fed.us/r5/inyo/recreation/wild/quotas.shtml\"&gt;Trailhead Quotas page&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Armstrong Canyon has &lt;b&gt;no quota&lt;/b&gt; (and &lt;i&gt;no trail&lt;/i&gt;), but you still need a permit for overnight trips starting there. If you take a large group, they might suddenly tell you there\'s a quota.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Approved bear-resistant containers are required for camping in Kings Canyon National Park, but not in the National Forest in Sawmill Canyon or Armstrong Canyon, but you are still required to protect bears from access to your food, by counterbalancing it &lt;b&gt;or&lt;/b&gt; using a bear-resistant container, etc. Check with the rangers in advance to get the current requirements.&lt;a name=\"chapter_6\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Car Camping Nearby&lt;/h2&gt;They say it\'s nice to camp near Scotty Springs on the road between Sawmill pass trailhead and Armstrong Canyon - some info on the road to Armstrong Canyon and camping in the area is given at &lt;a href=\"http://www.gbr.4wdtrips.net/4x4/division-armstrong.html\"&gt;http://www.gbr.4wdtrips.net/4x4/division-armstrong.html&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/a&gt;See &lt;a href=\"http://www.fs.fed.us/r5/inyo/recreation/campgrounds.shtml\"&gt; http://www.fs.fed.us/r5/inyo/recreation/campgrounds.shtml&lt;/a&gt; for car camping.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There\'s a \"Sawmill Creek Campground\" shown on the USGS Topo where Tinemaha Road (old 395) crosses Sawmill Creek, but I don\'t recall seeing it as I drove by - I believe it\'s defunct. The Goodale Creek Campground is listed as the nearest campground by &lt;a href=\"http://sierranevadawild.gov/modules/html/trailheads/sawmill_pass.htm\"&gt;http://sierranevadawild.gov/modules/html/trailheads/sawmill_pass.htm&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_7\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;External Links&lt;/h2&gt;Some of my pictures are in my &lt;a href=\"http://community.webshots.com/myphotos?action=viewAllPhotos&amp;amp;albumID=550943453&amp;amp;security=SNEaju\"&gt;Colosseum Mtn. 2006&lt;/a&gt; album.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;See an artificial aerial view of Sawmill Pass and Colosseum Mtn., etc., at &lt;a href=\"http://geogdata.csun.edu/sierraweb/sierra_nevada-Pages/Image84.html\"&gt;http://geogdata.csun.edu/sierraweb/sierra_nevada-Pages/Image84.html&lt;/a&gt;                    &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A little kit of information for my trip to Colosseum is at  &lt;a href=\"http://www.langenbacher.org/Sawmill\"&gt;http://www.langenbacher.org/Sawmill&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;See also &lt;a href=\"http://www.langenbacher.org/Armstrong\"&gt;http://www.langenbacher.org/Armstrong&lt;/a&gt; for stuff about the approach through Armstrong Canyon.&lt;a name=\"chapter_8\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;California Bighorn Sheep&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;\"The wild sheep ranks highest among the animal mountaineers...

They are clearly one of the most endangered mammals of North America.\"&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;You can read something about them at &lt;a href=\"http://www.dfg.ca.gov/ocal/archives/bighorn_sheep_jf04.pdf\"&gt;http://www.dfg.ca.gov/ocal/archives/bighorn_sheep_jf04.pdf&lt;/a&gt;, or at &lt;a href=\"http://www.sierrabighorn.org/\"&gt;http://www.sierrabighorn.org/&lt;/a&gt; .&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The US Fish and Wildlife Service \"Final Recovery Plan for the Sierra Nevada Bighorn Sheep\" of Feb. 13, 2008, is &lt;a href=\"http://ecos.fws.gov/docs/recovery_plan/080213.pdf\"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. They do consider the Bighorns to be seriously endangered, but they make these statements which would be of interest to mountain climbers:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Actions to ameliorate the effects of human/recreational use were not given high priority in this plan because we do not currently consider recreational use, including the activities of dogs, a significant threat to Sierra Nevada bighorn. If information indicating recreational use is having an effect on recovery becomes available, appropriate actions will be recommended.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Although we recognize the potential of recreation to impact bighorn sheep, these impacts seem to be minor. However, the recovery plan calls for continued monitoring of the compatibility between recreational use of bighorn sheep habitat and bighorn sheep recovery&lt;br&gt;&lt;div align=\"center\"&gt;&lt;a name=\"messages\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_9\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Additions and Corrections&lt;/h2&gt;[ &lt;a href=\"/object_discussion.php?type=vote_comments&amp;amp;object_id=197009&amp;amp;is_addition=1#vote_form\"&gt;Post an Addition or Correction&lt;/a&gt; ]&lt;table cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" style=\"width: 775px;\"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;table cellpadding=\"2\" cellspacing=\"2\" width=\"100%\"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;&lt;span class=\"pagertext\"&gt;Viewing: &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;-&lt;b&gt;3&lt;/b&gt; of &lt;b&gt;3&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td align=\"center\"&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td align=\"right\"&gt;    &lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;table border=\"0\" width=\"775\" class=\"messages\"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td width=\"110\" align=\"left\" valign=\"top\" style=\"padding-top: 6px;\"&gt;&lt;a name=\"136472\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a class=\"dis_user_lnk\" href=\"/users/matt-worster/24758\"&gt;Matt Worster&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td valign=\"top\" style=\"padding-top: 6px;\"&gt;&lt;b&gt;minor quibble&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td align=\"right\" valign=\"top\" nowrap style=\"font-size: 10px;\"&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td valign=\"top\" rowspan=\"2\" align=\"left\" style=\"padding-top: 6px;\"&gt;&lt;p class=\"disc_avatar\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"/users/matt-worster/24758\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Matt Worster\" width=\"50\" height=\"50\" border=\"0\" src=\"/images/avatars/193353.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=\"font-size: 9px; color: #888;\"&gt;Hasn\'t voted&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td colspan=\"2\" style=\"padding-top: 6px;\"&gt;Right vs. wrong . . . or higher vs. lower?  :-)&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td valign=\"bottom\" style=\"padding-top: 6px;\" colspan=\"2\"&gt;&lt;span style=\"font-size: 9px; color: #888;\"&gt;Posted Jun 6, 2006 12:58 am&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;table border=\"0\" width=\"745\" class=\"messages\" style=\"margin-left: 30px;\"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td rowspan=\"4\" valign=\"top\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/styles/layout/reply_arrow.gif\"&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td width=\"110\" align=\"left\" valign=\"top\" style=\"padding-top: 6px;\"&gt;&lt;a name=\"136559\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a class=\"dis_user_lnk\" href=\"/users/langenbacher/1860\"&gt;Langenbacher&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td valign=\"top\" style=\"padding-top: 6px;\"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Re: minor quibble&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td align=\"right\" valign=\"top\" nowrap style=\"font-size: 10px;\"&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td valign=\"top\" rowspan=\"2\" align=\"left\" style=\"padding-top: 6px;\"&gt;&lt;p class=\"disc_avatar\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"/users/langenbacher/1860\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Langenbacher\" width=\"50\" height=\"50\" border=\"0\" src=\"/images/avatars/193732.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=\"font-size: 9px; color: #888;\"&gt;Hasn\'t voted&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td colspan=\"2\" style=\"padding-top: 6px;\"&gt;The one with the register vs. the one without the register - that much I\'m sure of.

Though short (~30 feet on the uphill and ~40 feet on the downhill sides), this peculiar looking formation overhangs dramatically on all sides &ndash; it is essentially a ball sitting atop a cylindrical pedestal.  This is no Moses or &lt;a href=\"http://www.summitpost.org/mountain/rock/151527/castleton-tower.html\"&gt;Castleton&lt;/a&gt; - but if you have an hour to kill in Moab and want a quick \"mini-tower\", this is your guy!&lt;a name=\"chapter_2\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Getting There&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;div align=\"center\" class=\"image-left\" style=\"width: 206px;\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"/devil-s-golf-ball/247653\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Devil s Golf Ball\" height=\"150\" width=\"200\" src=\"/images/small/247653.JPG\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=\"caption\"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br&gt;From US 191 in downtown Moab, turn west onto Kane Creek Blvd. near the McDonalds.  In a couple miles, the road reaches and shadows the Colorado River (side opposite to &lt;a href=\"http://www.summitpost.org/mountain/rock/155036/wall-street.html\"&gt;Wall Street&lt;/a&gt;).  The pavement will end and you will pass the &lt;a href=\"http://www.summitpost.org/canyon/186102/kane-creek-utah.html\"&gt;Cirque of the Climbables&lt;/a&gt; just after leaving the Colorado River (at Kane Springs), the &lt;a href=\"http://www.summitpost.org/mountain/rock/243003/ice-cream-parlor.html\"&gt;Ice Cream Parlor&lt;/a&gt;, and eventually The &lt;a href=\"http://www.summitpost.org/view_object.php?object_id=247846&amp;amp;confirm_post=7\"&gt;Predator&lt;/a&gt; tower (a quarter mile away on the right).  The valley opens up before The &lt;a href=\"http://www.summitpost.org/view_object.php?object_id=247846&amp;amp;confirm_post=7\"&gt;Predator&lt;/a&gt; (~3 miles from Kane Springs).  At this point, look for the formation 200 yards away from road on the left (east side).  Pensive Putterman tower (of equal stature) is immediately above the road on the right at this point.  Either park here (~3 minute hike) or if using your car for aid (high clearance only), look for ATV trails just past the formation leaving the main road in direction of the formation.

These sites are free, but campers are required to carry out all garbage, including solid human waste.

Follow a 6-bolt ladder on the east side of the formation.  The first bolt is WAY high &ndash; even stepping on the roof of our truck I could not reach it without a cheater stick.  There was a long steel pole available at its base when we did it.  Bjornstad&rsquo;s guidebook (&lt;i&gt;Desert Rock III:  Moab to Colorado National Monument&lt;/i&gt;, ISBN 1-56044-754-0) gives this route a free rating of 5.8 &ndash; have fun with that!!

In the neighborhood of higher and more impressive peaks like Mount Wolverine, Sunset Peak, Devil&rsquo;s Castle, and Mount Superior this peak is easily overlooked. However, being located on the north east edge of the Wolverine Cirque this peak offers outstanding views into both Little and Big  Cottonwood Canyons, and great views of Grizzly Gulch and Twin Lakes.  Climbing it just to see the impressive Wolverine Cirque, with it 50 degree drops, is as good a reason as any to summit this peak.   &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;From the Big Cottonwood Canyon side Patsy Marley is located just behind Mount Millicent of Brighton Ski Resort, and from the Little Cottonwood Canyon Patsy Marley is clearly visible from Alta on it&rsquo;s east end. From Patsy Marley it is a quick jaunt along the ridge of the Wolverine Cirque to Mount Wolverine and Mount Tuscarora.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If accessing Patsy Marley from Alta one may pass through the Grizzly Gulch, which is an open museum of the mining activity in Utah at the turn of 20th century (or even earlier). There are dozens of abandoned mines in the steep canyon, along with old boilers and pipes, and other relics of days gone by. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Some claim \"Patsy Marley\" (sometimes spelled &ldquo;Patsey Marley&rdquo;) is named after a noted Madame from the silver mining days.  While others assert -- with more credibility -- that the name comes from a mining claim in Grizzly Gulch named after the owner, an Irish fellow with a lengthy history in Alta mining. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When approaching Patsy Marley from the Alta side, one will notice a large rectangular shaped white structure on it\'s westerly aspect.  This structure, which looks a bit like a billboard but without writing, is actually owned by ATT and is a reflector for their signals.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div align=\"center\" class=\"image\" style=\"width: 506px;\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"/wolverine-massif/275815\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Wolverine Massif\" height=\"334\" width=\"500\" src=\"/images/medium/275815.JPG\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=\"caption\"&gt;Patsy Marley and Neighbors as viewed from Big Cottonwood Canyon&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_2\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Getting There&lt;/h2&gt;Patsy Marley can be accessed from either Alta Ski Resort in Little Cottonwood Canyon, or from Brighton Ski Resort in Big Cottonwood Canyon.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;From downtown Salt Lake City, follow these directions to reach Brighton Ski Resort:&lt;br&gt;&lt;li&gt;I-15 S toward LAS VEGAS/CHEYENNE. 8.3 miles &lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Take the I-215 exit- exit number 302- toward BELT ROUTE. 0.2 miles &lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Merge onto I-215 E via the exit- on the left- toward SKI AREAS. 5.1 miles &lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Take the 6200 SO. exit- exit number 6- toward SKI AREAS/SOLITUDE / BRIGHTON/SNOWBIRD / ALTA. 0.2 miles &lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Take the ramp toward SKI AREAS/SOLITUDE / BRIGHTON/SNOWBIRD / ALTA. 0.1 miles &lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Turn RIGHT onto UT-190 E/E 6200 S. Continue to follow UT-190 E. 1.6 miles &lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Turn LEFT onto E BIG COTTONWOOD CANYON RD/UT-190. 14.0 miles &lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;End at Brighton UT &lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Park near the Millicent ski lift, as the beginning of your hike with be toward Twin Lakes.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Or alternatively to reach Alta Ski Resort continue past the intersection with Big Cottonwood Canyon RD, and follow Wasatch BLVD over to Little Cottonwood Canyon.  Provided that you don\'t make any turns off of the main road, you will eventually drive up Little Cottonwood Canyon to Alta Ski Resort.   Once at Alta park at the Grizzly Parking lot, as your hike will begin in Grizzly Gulch.&lt;br&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_3\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Routes&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;div align=\"center\" class=\"image-left\" style=\"width: 206px;\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"/accessing-patsy-marley-from-twin-lakes/395015\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Accessing Patsy Marley from Twin Lakes\" height=\"150\" width=\"200\" src=\"/images/small/395015.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=\"caption\"&gt;Accessing Patsy Marley from Twin Lakes.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br&gt;If hiking, snowshoeing, or skiing in from Brighton make your way to Twin Lakes Reservoir, which is visible from Brighton Ski Resort as one heads west toward Mount Millicent (on the west side of the parking lot).   From Twin Lakes head to the Twin Lakes Pass (at approximately 10,000 ft); once you gain the pass follow the ridge line to your left (south) as it eventually curves to the west, and scramble up to the Peak of Patsy Marley.  From the dam wall at Twin Lakes to the top of Twin Lakes pass is just over 1 km (0.6 miles) as the crow files, &lt;i&gt;so one might double that distance for the actual walking distance&lt;/i&gt;.  And from the pass to the peak is about 0.7 km (less than 0.5 miles) as the crow flies.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If hiking, snowshoeing, or skiing in from Alta, the most direct route is via Grizzly Gulch to Twin Lakes Pass via the Twin Lakes Pass road (cat track in the winter). Once you gain the pass, which is less than 2 miles walking distance, follow the ridge line to your right (south) as it eventually curves to the west, and scramble up to the Peak of Patsy Marley.  For a longer hike, gain Catherine&rsquo;s pass to the south of Mount Tuscarora, head North gaining 450 vertical feet to Mount Tuscarora.  From Tuscarora go west to Mount Wolverine, and then follow the cirque west and north to Patsy Marley. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;All of the routes mentioned above are fun, half day backcountry ski routes.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_4\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Red Tape&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;div align=\"center\" class=\"image-right\" style=\"width: 156px;\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"/sign-near-patsy-marley-peak/395018\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Sign Near Patsy Marley Peak\" height=\"200\" width=\"150\" src=\"/images/small/395018.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=\"caption\"&gt;Warning to Winter Climbers.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br&gt;Neither permits nor fees required.

Alternatively, free camping is permitted in the nearby Mt Olympus, Broads Fork Twin Peaks, or Lone Peak Wilderness areas as long as it is done at least 100 ft away from trails.&lt;a name=\"chapter_6\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Mountain Conditions&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://www.alta.com/pages/weather.php\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;Alta Ski Resort&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://www.utah.com/ski/resorts/brighton.htm\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;Brighton Ski Resort&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://wasatchmountainclub.org\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;Wasatch Mountain Club&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://utahavalanchecenter.org/\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;Utah Avalanche Center&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://www.csac.org\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;The Avalanche Center&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div align=\"center\" class=\"image\" style=\"width: 506px;\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"/two-fools/393178\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Two Fools?\" height=\"375\" width=\"500\" src=\"/images/medium/393178.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=\"caption\"&gt;Patsy Marley as seen from Mt.

This peak is actually within Brighton Ski Area boundaries, and during the ski season Preston Peak is a very short walk from the top of the Snake Creek chair lift. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This rather plain peak is flanked by Clayton Peak on it\'s north east (47&deg;) aspect, and Pioneer ridge &lt;i&gt;(and Pioneer Peak)&lt;/i&gt; on it\'s west (275&deg;) aspect.  Climbing Preston Peak and both it\'s neighbors in one trip is recommended, since Preston is less than a mile &lt;i&gt;(as the crow flys)&lt;/i&gt; from either. Preston Peak is unnamed on the USGS topographic maps, but maps of Brighton have it clearly named and labeled at 10,315 feet. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The views, in every direction, make climbing this unpretentious peak worth the while. From its peak one can see east into the Heber Valley, south into American Fork Canyon &lt;i&gt;(home of mighty Mt. Timpanogos)&lt;/i&gt;, north down Big Cottonwood canyon toward Salt Lake City, and west at Pioneer Peak, Sunset Peak, Mt. Tuscarora, and Mt. Wolverine. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div align=\"center\" class=\"image\" style=\"width: 506px;\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"/preston-peak-and-pioneer-ridge/401750\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Preston Peak and Pioneer Ridge\" height=\"375\" width=\"500\" src=\"/images/medium/401750.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=\"caption\"&gt;Preston Peak (left), and Pioneer Ridge(right), with Mt.

Alternatively, for a less steep climb, follow the Snake Creek chair lift to its top and then head west to the peak.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div align=\"center\" class=\"image\" style=\"width: 506px;\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"/brighton-ski-resort-trail-map-showing-preston-peak/401756\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Brighton Ski Resort Trail Map, Showing Preston Peak\" height=\"376\" width=\"500\" src=\"/images/medium/401756.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=\"caption\"&gt;Preston Peak is Located Slightly East of the Brightons Crest Express Chair Lift&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_4\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Red Tape&lt;/h2&gt;When Brighton Ski Resort is closed, there shouldn\'t be any red tape.

Alternatively, free camping is permitted in the nearby Mt Olympus, Broads Fork Twin Peaks, or Lone Peak Wilderness areas as long as it is done at least 100 ft away from trails.&lt;br&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_6\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;External Links&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://www.skibrighton.com\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;Brigton Ski Resort&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://wasatchmountainclub.org\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;Wasatch Mountain Club&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://utahavalanchecenter.org/\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;Utah Avalanche Center&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://www.csac.org\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;The Avalanche Center&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_7\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Images&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div align=\"center\"&gt;&lt;table id=\"my_images\"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/preston-peak-and-pioneer-ridge/401750/c-401747\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Preston Peak and Pioneer Ridge\" src=\"/images/square/401750.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/preston-peak-utah/401749/c-401747\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Preston Peak, Utah\" src=\"/images/square/401749.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/preston-plaque-marker/731786/c-401747\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Preston Plaque Marker\" src=\"/images/square/731786.JPG\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/brighton-ski-resort-trail-map-showing-preston-peak/401756/c-401747\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Brighton Ski Resort Trail Map, Showing Preston Peak\" src=\"/images/square/401756.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/article&gt;date:difficulty:'),(148,406145,'/mt-carl-heller/406145','/john-muir-wilderness/170988','Mt Carl Heller','Mountaineering, Trad Climbing, Scrambling','','','13211','',10338,36.6114,-118.299,'California, United States, North America','','',170988,'John Muir Wilderness','','','','Spring, Summer, Fall, Winter','','Mountain-Rock','content: &lt;article&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_1\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Overview&lt;/h2&gt;Mt Carl Heller is the popular name of a remote peak located in the Mt Whitney region of the High Sierra. It is frequently overlooked as it&rsquo;s overshadowed by the neighboring fourteeners, &lt;a href=\"http://www.summitpost.org/mountain/rock/150227/mount-whitney.html\"&gt;Mt Whitney&lt;/a&gt; &amp;amp; &lt;a href=\"http://www.summitpost.org/mountain/rock/150515/mount-russell.html\"&gt;Mt Russell&lt;/a&gt; to the south and &lt;a href=\"http://www.summitpost.org/mountain/rock/150438/mount-williamson.html\"&gt;Mt Williamson&lt;/a&gt; &amp;amp; &lt;a href=\"http://www.summitpost.org/mountain/rock/150441/mount-tyndall.html\"&gt;Mt Tyndall&lt;/a&gt; to the north. Due to its remoteness, Carl Heller usually requires a multi-day outing except  when using the now year round arduous approach up &lt;a href=\"http://www.summitpost.org/route/156442/southeast-ridge.html\"&gt;George Creek&lt;/a&gt;. Carl Heller&rsquo;s East Ar&ecirc;te, visible from Highway 395 around the &lt;a href=\"http://www.nps.gov/manz\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Manzanar Internment Center, is considered one of the finer knife edge scrambles in the Sierra. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The peak is unmarked on the current 7.5 degree USGS topographic maps and lies about 1 mile northwest of &lt;a href=\"http://www.summitpost.org/mountain/rock/151977/tunnabora-peak.html\"&gt;Tunnabora Peak&lt;/a&gt;. According to &lt;a href=\"http://www.peakbagger.com/peak.aspx?pid=2821\"&gt;Peakbagger.com&lt;/a&gt;, the peak sports a clean prominence of 495&rsquo;. The peak is named after &lt;a href=\"http://www.whitneyportalstore.com/forum/ubbthreads.php/ubb/showflat/Forum/1/topic/005219/Number/0/site_id/1#import\"&gt;Dr Carl Heller&lt;/a&gt;, the founder of the &lt;a href=\"http://www.clmrg.org\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;China Lake Mountain Rescue Group. The proposed name was submitted to the &lt;a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Board_on_Geographic_Names\"&gt;Board of Geographical Names&lt;/a&gt; and not accepted. However, through common use and inclusion in R.J. Secor&rsquo;s &ldquo;&lt;a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/High-Sierra-Peaks-Passes-Trails/dp/0898866251\"&gt;The High Sierra &ndash; Peaks, Passes, and Trails&lt;/a&gt;&rdquo; book, the name has become accepted among mountaineering circles.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div style=\"WIDTH: 506px\" class=\"image\" align=\"center\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"/mt-carl-heller-from-the-east/406143\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Mt Carl Heller from the east\" src=\"/images/medium/406143.JPG\" width=\"500\" height=\"332\" unselectable=\"on\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=\"caption\"&gt;From the unnamed lake near the toe of the East Ar&ecirc;te&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_2\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Getting There&lt;/h2&gt;Mt Carl Heller can be approached from either the east or west of the Sierra crest. Wallace Lake marks the beginning of the western slope of the mountain and can be approached from either the south or the west. George Creek is used to access the east side of Carl Heller. The Sierra crest can be crossed south of the peak by first climbing and then descending Tunnabora Peak or north by crossing via Vacation Pass. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://www.summitpost.org/route/156442/southeast-ridge.html\"&gt;George Creek&lt;/a&gt; is the quickest approach and delivers the scrambler to the foot of the East Ar&ecirc;te.  Follow use trails up George Creek until the first camping site is encountered at about 8900&rsquo; next to a tributary of George Creek. Depart the main George Creek valley up this side canyon towards Vacation Pass. After hiking over a couple of benches, proceed to the obvious foot of the East Ar&ecirc;te of Carl Heller.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;li&gt;The Wallace Lake Basin can be approached from the John Muir Trail from the west or from the Tuleinyo Lake basin to the south (via &lt;a href=\"http://www.summitpost.org/route/156894/east-ridge.html\"&gt;Russell-Carillion Pass&lt;/a&gt; or the &lt;a href=\"http://www.summitpost.org/route/243418/North-Ridge.html#chapter_2\"&gt;Cleaver Col&lt;/a&gt;) using the &lt;a href=\"http://www.summitpost.org/route/155528/mountaineer-s.html#chapter_2\"&gt;North Fork of Lone Pine&lt;/a&gt; from the &lt;a href=\"http://www.climber.org/DrivingDirections/WhitneyArea.html\"&gt;Whitney Portal&lt;/a&gt;. Both of the routes would probably require multi-day trips since the approaches are a healthy distance from any trailhead.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;li&gt;The Sierra Crest crossing can be used to return to the correct side if someone is planning an east to west climb/descent of Carl Heller. The East Ar&ecirc;te makes a much better ascent route then descent route so the recommendation is to always start on the east side. If using the southern route to Wallace Lake, it makes the most sense to ascend Tunnabora Peak via the standard class 2 slog route and descend via the &lt;a href=\"http://www.snwburd.com/bob/trip_reports/tunnabora_1.html\"&gt;NE chute&lt;/a&gt; down into the basin by Carl Heller&rsquo;s East Ar&ecirc;te. If using the John Muir trail and the unmaintained Wallace Creek trail to approach the west side of the peak, the obvious choice is to cross via Vacation Pass which is about a &frac14; mile north of the low point that lies just north of Carl Heller.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;table border=\"0\" cellspacing=\"10\" cellpadding=\"0\"&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;th&gt;&lt;img src=\"http://www.summitpost.org/images/medium/406140.jpg\" unselectable=\"on\"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://www.summitpost.org/view_object.php?object_id=406140\"&gt;Mt Carl Heller from the north looking from Mt Barnard&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/th&gt;&lt;th&gt;&lt;img src=\"http://www.summitpost.org/images/medium/406141.jpg\" unselectable=\"on\"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://www.summitpost.org/view_object.php?object_id=406141\"&gt;Mt Carl Heller from the south looking from Tunnabora Pk&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/th&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_3\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Routes&lt;/h2&gt;East Ar&ecirc;te: Class 3/4. This is one of the finest scrambles in the Sierra. Start by climbing the class 4 toe about 50 feet to the beginning of the ridgeline. Most of the ridge is crack and friction exposed class 3 climbing interrupted by class 4 moves. About half-way up, a class 4 boulder provides pause to the ascent. Further scrambling leads to the final gendarme on the ridge. This long gendarme can be bypassed on its north side -- a source of additional exhilaration if snow exists on the narrow ledges. The final chute leading to the notch is either filled with blocky granite or snow, depending on time of year. The summit is surmounted from the notch by moving around the west side while climbing the blocks.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;West Slope: Class 3 to 5+. The western slope of Carl Heller is &ldquo;guarded&rdquo; by granite cliffs at the lower elevations. These cliffs can be bypassed by climbing up one of the chutes that leads from the southern end of Wallace Lake. The ribs toward the north end of the west slope are rated in the 5s according to R.J. Secor. The northwest ridge (south of the peaklets) is described as class 4. The enjoyable class 3 route leads up the southwest side of the peak over blocky granite. Careful route finding is required to keep this class 3 but this is good route to ascend and descend the peak.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;table border=\"0\" cellspacing=\"10\" cellpadding=\"20\"&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;th&gt;&lt;img src=\"http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3175/2487823207_e3aa98e6e3.jpg\" width=\"250\" height=\"340\" unselectable=\"on\"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/becht/2487823207/in/set-72157605030251577/\"&gt;Looking down the toe&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/th&gt;&lt;th&gt;&lt;img src=\"http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2002/2487824191_41f1060320.jpg\" width=\"250\" height=\"340\" unselectable=\"on\"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/becht/2487824191/in/set-72157605030251577/\"&gt;Marching up the ar&ecirc;te&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/th&gt;&lt;th&gt;&lt;img src=\"http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3005/2488644328_77090a7e65.jpg%20\" width=\"250\" height=\"340\" unselectable=\"on\"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/becht/2488644328/in/set-72157605030251577\"&gt;The ar&ecirc;te from the summit&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/th&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_4\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Red Tape , Camping, and Conditions&lt;/h2&gt;Everything you need to know about permits, regulations, and driving directions can be found on the &lt;a href=\"http://www.summitpost.org/logistical-center/154084/eastern-sierra.html\"&gt;Eastern Sierra - Logistical Center page&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"http://www.fs.fed.us/r5/inyo/recreation/wild/otheravail.shtml\"&gt;North Fork Lone Pine&lt;/a&gt; (NFLP) requires day hiking and overnight permits while George Creek only requires an overnight permit. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For an overnight trip, the best place to camp is either Tuleinyo Lake or Wallace Lake for the west side or the forested camp at the creek junction for the George Creek side.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Climbing can be done in almost any season but May through October are the most popular times.

The peak, as they call it, by definition, is not a real peak. It\'s prominence is way less than 300 ft and it is a point on a ridge to a higher peak called Gobblers Knob. This is a nice place to view much of the Canyon, along with the higher peaks.  This is an awesome peak to climb if you don\'t have much time. Doing this in the Winter might also be a fun challenge.   &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div align=\"center\" class=\"image\" style=\"width: 506px;\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"/360-panorama/554720\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"360 Panorama\" height=\"35\" width=\"500\" src=\"/images/medium/554720.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=\"caption\"&gt;Full Panorama&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_2\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How to get there&lt;/h2&gt;The peak can be climbed from Butlers Fork. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;To get to Butlers Fork basically go to Big Cottonwood Canyon.  About 7-8 miles into the canyon, you\'ll see a small pullout to the north.  Check the sign out and it will say \"Butlers Fork\".  &lt;br&gt;Continue on the main trail. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;After Half a mile, there is a junction.  Take the trail that goes right.  It will continue on Switchbacking up the mountain and you\'ll reach another junction.  One of the trails will be going north, this will take you to Bakers Pass.

The mountain separates Thayne Canyon from Porter Fork.   Millcreek Canyon is located north of Thayne Peak.  It is one of the major canyons that cuts through the Wasatch Mountains.  The canyon is heavily forested compared to the more alpine canyons farther south.  The slopes of Thayne Peak are also surrounded by trees.  It is not as well known as many of the higher peaks even though the summit is a short distance along the ridge from the trail.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The name of the peak can be seen spelled as Thayne or Thaynes depending on which map or book you look at.  The Wasatch Mountain Club map labels it as Thayne so that is the name I will use.  The peak can be reached from many trails but the most common include the Desolation Trail and Thayne Canyon.  The Desolation Trail is one the longest trails in the Central Wasatch.  It can be followed from the top of Millcreek Canyon all the way down to this trailhead.  The entire Desolation Trail hike is between eighteen to twenty-four miles in length.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The view from the summit of Thayne Peak is very good.  Across the canyon to the north is Millcreek Ridge with Grandeur Peak, Church Fork Peak, and Mount Aire.  To the southwest is Mount Olympus and the Wildcat Ridge.  Looking south and southeast is Mount Raymond and Gobblers Knob.  Peak 9,776 is located south of Thayne Peak and is another worthy summit in the area.  It forms the triple divide between Millcreek Canyon, Big Cottonwood Canyon, and Neffs Canyon.  To the west is Salt Lake Valley and farther behind are the Oquirrh Mountains.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When driving up Millcreek Canyon, you will notice several limestone cliffs and walls on both sides of the canyon.  The Thaynes Formation was deposited about 200 million years ago.  It consists predominantly of sandy, gray limestone and green-gray limey siltstones.  The Thaynes Formation is noted for its rich and varied collection of marine fossils.  It contains fossils of crustaceans, fish, bivalves, gastropods, ammonites, shark teeth, crinoids, brachiopods, microfossils, and fragmentary remains of an early ichthyosaur.  Thayne Peak and Thayne Canyon received its name from this rock formation. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_2\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Getting There&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;div align=\"center\" class=\"image-right\" style=\"width: 206px;\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"/thayne-peak/467296\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Thayne Peak\" height=\"150\" width=\"200\" src=\"/images/small/467296.JPG\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=\"caption\"&gt;Thayne Peak&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Desolation Trailhead:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;To get to the Desolation Trailhead, drive from Salt Lake City, head south on either I-15, State Street, or 700 East. After a few miles, get onto I-80 heading east and take it about five miles to the I-215 Belt Route. Head south on the I-215 Belt Route for about 2 miles and exit at 3900 South. Take a left at the top of the exit ramp and cross over I-215 heading east. At Wasatch Boulevard, the first light, take a left and head north one block to the light at 3800 South. Take a right on 3800 South and head east. It will progress through a residential area before taking you up into the canyon. After about a mile is an entrance station. The trailhead is 3.4 miles past the entrance station on the south side of the road.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Neffs Canyon Trailhead:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;From Salt Lake City, drive east toward Millcreek Canyon on 3800 South Wasatch Boulevard. At the first stop sign (Parkview Drive, 3700 East) turn right and go 1.1 miles to Parkview Terrace (4175 East, 4245 South). Turn left and continue to White Way (4275 South, 4260 East), turn right heading generally eastward and uphill to the end of the road.   This drive will take you up a hill through a residential area.  The trailhead is marked with a sign where you will see the parking area.  The trail begins here as a rocky dirt jeep road.  There is no parking allowed after 10:00 PM at this trailhead.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_3\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Routes Overview&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Desolation Trail and Thayne Canyon start from the Desolation Trailhead in Millcreek Canyon.  These two trails can be combined as a loop hike.  Neffs Canyon is below the north face of Mount Olympus.  The trail up this canyon eventually meets up with the Desolation Trail southwest of Thayne Peak.  Books and maps show different trail mileages so the ones listed below are approximate.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div align=\"center\" class=\"image-right\" style=\"width: 206px;\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"/thayne-peak/467299\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Thayne Peak\" height=\"144\" width=\"200\" src=\"/images/small/467299.JPG\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=\"caption\"&gt;Thayne Peak&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;u&gt;Thayne Canyon:&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The trail starts on the right side of the restroom and goes up the hill.  There will be a sign that states trail mileages.  A short distance down the trail will be a junction.  The trail on the right goes to the Desolation Trail and Salt Lake Overlook.  The trail on the left goes up Thayne Canyon and is the trail you&rsquo;ll want to take.  The trail goes past some rock walls as it starts switchbacks to the left.  The route becomes more defined as the canyon narrows higher up.  This part of the trail resembles a gully and most views are of the forest.  It is full of snow in winter and usually in the shade.  The trail climbs steeply in a few places as it meets up with a signed junction with the Desolation Trail.  You&rsquo;ll want to hike up the Desolation Trail now.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The trail starts going up a series of switchbacks up the mountainside.  In winter, the trail may not be visible so some people head straight up the canyon from here.  It is easier to try and follow the normal summer route though.  A long switchback heads toward the pass located southwest of Thayne Peak which will be above the trail.  The summit is a short distance from the trail to the north.  The summit is located among the tress.  You&rsquo;ll have great views of the south side of Millcreek Ridge and the north side of the Mount Olympus to Raymond and Gobblers Knob.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;(Distance is 2.75 miles from the trailhead to the summit with 2,876 feet gain)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div align=\"center\" class=\"image-right\" style=\"width: 206px;\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"/desolation-trail/467301\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Desolation Trail\" height=\"150\" width=\"200\" src=\"/images/small/467301.JPG\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=\"caption\"&gt;Desolation Trail&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;u&gt;Desolation Trail:&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This section of the Desolation Trail was originally built for motorcycles.  It is very gradual compared to a normal hiking trail so don&rsquo;t expect to get anywhere in a hurry.  Try to stay on the trail and avoid cutting switchbacks.  The trail is now located in the Mount Olympus Wilderness so motorcycles and vehicles are not allowed on the trail anymore.  Thayne Canyon is the more direct route to Thayne Peak but the Desolation Trail is out in the open and offers better views across the canyon.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Desolation Trail begins on the right side of the restroom and goes up the hill.  There will be a sign that states trail mileages.  A short distance down the trail will be a junction.  The trail on the left goes up Thayne Canyon and is the trail you&rsquo;ll want to take.  The trail on the left goes up Thayne Canyon.  The trail on the right follows the Desolation Trail.  Take the trail on the right.  There are numerous switchbacks that climb up the mountainside.  The WMC map shows a total of thirteen.  This leads to the Salt Lake Valley Overlook.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;From the overlook it is another 1.5 miles of hiking to get to the next signed junction.  This is where Thayne Canyon will come in from the east and join the Desolation Trail.  The trail starts going up a series of switchbacks up the mountainside.  In winter, the trail may not be visible so some people head straight up the canyon from here.  It is easier to try and follow the normal summer route though.  A long switchback heads toward the pass located southwest of Thayne Peak which will be above the trail.  The summit is a short distance from the trail to the north.  You&rsquo;ll have great views of the south side of Millcreek Ridge and the north side of the Mount Olympus to Raymond and Gobblers Knob.  The summit is located among rocks surrounded by trees.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;(Distance is 4.75 miles from the trailhead to the summit with 2,906 feet gain)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div align=\"center\" class=\"image-right\" style=\"width: 153px;\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"/thayne-canyon/467303\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Thayne Canyon\" height=\"200\" width=\"147\" src=\"/images/small/467303.JPG\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=\"caption\"&gt;Grandeur Peak&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;u&gt;Neffs Canyon:&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Neffs Canyon is directly south of Millcreek Canyon. It is the rugged canyon that runs along the north side of Mount Olympus.  It provides access to rock climbing routes for that mountain.  The canyon was named after John Neff.  He was an early settler that lived nearby who built a flour mill in Millcreek Canyon.  Also of importance to spelunkers is Neffs Cave.  It happens to be one of the deepest caves in the United States.  The trail does not go to the cave but it is in the area.  I will keep its location a secret.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The trail starts from the left side of the parking area. It climbs a short jeep track, until you reach the first landmark which is a water tower and a small service shack with a fence around it.  As you continue up the trail, you will reach a small area with a little stream running through it.  This is marked by a split in the jeep track.  Continue up above the stream and it becomes a regular that takes you up the canyon.  This will be 1.25 miles from the trailhead.  The trail winds its way through some oak brush and is rocky in some areas. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The stream will eventually reappear as you hike up the canyon to a meadow.  From the meadow is a good view of Mount Olympus.  This is about 2.75 miles from the trailhead.  The trail goes up a hill and then takes you up a boulder field.  This area usually has avalanches in winter.  The ridge above is reached by a long switchback.  The trail then goes northeast toward Thayne Canyon Pass.  Now you can follow the Desolation Trail that goes near the south face of Thayne Peak.  It is an easy hike from here to the summit.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;(Distance is 4.9 miles from the trailhead to the summit with 3,190 feet elevation gain)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_4\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Red Tape&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;div align=\"center\" class=\"image-right\" style=\"width: 206px;\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"/salt-lake-overlook/467305\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Salt Lake Overlook\" height=\"150\" width=\"200\" src=\"/images/small/467305.JPG\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=\"caption\"&gt;Salt Lake Valley&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br&gt;Thayne Peak is located in &lt;a href=\"http://www.fs.fed.us/r4/uwc/\"&gt;Wasatch-Cache National Forest&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There is a $3.00 fee per vehicle required when you leave Millcreek Canyon.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Dogs are allowed without leashes in Millcreek Canyon on odd-numbered days and with leashes on even-numbered days. If you want take your dog hiking on the weekend, it is recommended that you go on an odd number day because it is less crowded.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Bikes are only allowed in Millcreek Canyon on even-numbered days.  Hikers should plan accordingly if you wish to avoid bicyclists on the trail&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_5\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;When to Climb&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;div align=\"center\" class=\"image-right\" style=\"width: 206px;\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"/church-fork/467297\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Church Fork\" height=\"150\" width=\"200\" src=\"/images/small/467297.JPG\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=\"caption\"&gt;Church Fork&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br&gt;This mountain can be hiked year round.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The most popular time is from May to September.  You can expect more solitude outside of those months.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Thayne Canyon and the Desolation Trail are on the shaded north side of the mountain.  Neffs Canyon is located on the west side.  During winter, there will be snow on Thayne Peak.  Trails may be packed down by other hikers depending on current conditions.  Snowshoes will be helpful on the upper part of the mountain.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;                                                                                                                                                                        &lt;a name=\"chapter_6\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Books and Maps&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;br&gt;1) &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Hiking the Wasatch Book&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;: by John Veranth.

The name was suggested to honor veteran Kings Canyon National Park Ranger Randy Morgenson, who disappeared while on duty in 1996. Rather than look up the details concerning this mystery online, I instead recommend that you read Eric Blehm&rsquo;s excellent book, &lt;a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0060583010?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;tag=schmedcentral&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=390957&amp;amp;creativeASIN=0060583010\"&gt;The Last Season&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Based on Digital Elevation Model data, &ldquo;Mt. Morgenson&rdquo; apparently meets the 300\' prominence criterion for inclusion in the &lt;a href=\"http://www.summitpost.org/list/509575/california-thirteeners.html\"&gt;California Thirteeners&lt;/a&gt; by only two feet (i.e., really too close to call).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;NOTE:&lt;/b&gt; &ldquo;Mt. Morgenson&rdquo; should be distinguished from the West Peak of Mt. Russell (the higher of Russell&rsquo;s twin summits, which are separated by only 0.1 miles).&lt;a name=\"chapter_2\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Getting There&lt;/h2&gt;You may be tempted to climb &ldquo;Mt. Morgenson&rdquo; as a class 3 traverse from &lt;a href=\"http://www.summitpost.org/mountain/rock/150515/mount-russell.html\"&gt;Mt. Russell&lt;/a&gt;. Climbing Mt. Russell via its east ridge (class 3) from Upper Boy Scout Lake is a fine route (though I enjoyed the South Face, Right Side route even more). The traverse from Russell to Mortgenson, however, was far from enjoyable. I would certainly recommend ascending the NE Slopes instead:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Take 395 to Lone Pine, then turn west on the Whitney Portal Road and continue for 12.1 miles to Whitney Portal and the Mount Whitney Trailhead overnight parking area. The trail begins 0.2 miles further at the end of the road (8268\'+). Merge carefully into the thick column of &lt;a href=\"http://www.summitpost.org/mountain/rock/150227/mount-whitney.html\"&gt;Mt. Whitney&lt;/a&gt; hikers and continue for a mile, then signal and exit right just before the trail crosses Lone Pine Creek. From here, try to find and follow the &ldquo;official&rdquo; cross-country route up the North Fork of Lone Pine Creek to 11,950\'+ Clyde Meadow (see R. J. Secor&rsquo;s &lt;a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0898869714/schmedcentral\"&gt;The High Sierra - Peaks, Passes, Trails&lt;/a&gt; for an excellent description, but you&rsquo;ll probably still get lost trying to find the Ebersbacher Ledges.) Go over &ldquo;Russell-Carillon Pass&rdquo; (class 2-3), skirt the south side of Tulainyo Lake and continue west to the northeast slopes of &ldquo;Mt. Morgenson&rdquo;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I highly recommend R. J. Secor&rsquo;s &lt;a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0898869714/schmedcentral\"&gt;The High Sierra, Peaks Passes &amp;amp; Trails&lt;/a&gt; (now in its third edition). This is the definitive climbing guide to the Sierra and was the source for many of the details on my SummitPost pages.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_3\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Red Tape&lt;/h2&gt;Like most places in the Sierra, you need a Wilderness Permit for overnight camping in the summer. The extremely high use of the Mt. Whitney Trail has resulted in a quota and lottery even for &lt;a href=\"http://www.summitpost.org/mountain/rock/150227/mount-whitney.html\"&gt;Mt. Whitney&lt;/a&gt; day hikers. This has forced more and more alpinists to use the Mountaineer&rsquo;s Route from Iceberg Lake, which shares the same Lone Pine Creek entry described above. Accordingly, you&rsquo;ll want to reserve your permit early. I also recommend beginning all ranger conversations with, &ldquo;We&rsquo;re not climbing Mt. Whitney, but ...&rdquo;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Detailed information on permits, regulations and trailhead access can be found on Matthew Holliman&rsquo;s excellent &lt;a href=\"http://www.summitpost.org/logistical%20center/154084/eastern-sierra.html\"&gt;Eastern Sierra logistics page&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;a name=\"chapter_4\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Camping&lt;/h2&gt;Upper Boy Scout Lake provides a nice campsite with access to the &ldquo;Russell-Carillon Pass&rdquo;. From here, you can easily climb &lt;a href=\"http://www.summitpost.org/mountain/rock/150515/mount-russell.html\"&gt;Mt. Russell&lt;/a&gt; and &ldquo;Mt. Morgenson&rdquo; as well as &lt;a href=\"http://www.summitpost.org/mountain/rock/151455/mount-carillon.html\"&gt;Mt. Carillon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"http://www.summitpost.org/mountain/rock/418993/the-cleaver.html\"&gt;&ldquo;The Cleaver&rdquo;&lt;/a&gt;. You can also climb the Mountaineer&rsquo;s Route on &lt;a href=\"http://www.summitpost.org/mountain/rock/150227/mount-whitney.html\"&gt;Mt. Whitney&lt;/a&gt; from here, but I&rsquo;d suggest moving camp to Iceberg Lake before doing so, as that has better views.                                                                                                                               &lt;a name=\"chapter_5\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Images&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div align=\"center\"&gt;&lt;table id=\"my_images\"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/mt-russell-from-lone-pine-peak/491456/c-528220\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Mt.

Each lake has thier own unique beauty as well as vista. The lower Red Pine Lake is the largest and most scenic of all the lakes in Red Pine Fork. When hiking up from the White Pine Trailhead, it is at this lower lake where you get your first uninterupted view of The Little Pfeifferhorn. If you are lucky enough during the summer months, choose a windy day and the color of the lakes can appear bright turquise insted of dark blue. Swimming is NOT allowed in any of the Red Pine Lakes so please resist the temptation. &lt;br&gt;&lt;div style=\"width: 506px;\" class=\"image-right\" align=\"center\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"/red-pine-lake/521242\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Red Pine Lake\" src=\"/images/medium/521242.jpg\" width=\"500\" height=\"375\" unselectable=\"on\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=\"caption\"&gt;Lower Red Pine Lake from the summit&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div style=\"width: 506px;\" class=\"image-left\" align=\"center\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"/the-little-pfeifferhorn/533785\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"The Little Pfeifferhorn\" src=\"/images/medium/533785.jpg\" width=\"500\" height=\"315\" unselectable=\"on\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=\"caption\"&gt;A summer view of The Little Pfeifferhorn through the trees (Red Pine Fork side)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In the summer the trail is easier to find as well as hike making this the recommended season for people who are new to this area. In the winter months the trail travels along several avalanche paths and eventually sends you climbing right up a release zone shortly before the summit. Caution should be used on the most dangerous of avalanche days and of course carry a beacon, probe, shovel, avalung, and common sense along with you during your winter travels. In the spring time ice axes and crampons are not a bad idea for the upper ridge section. Because of the high elevation (10,897 feet) this mountain receives over 600 inches of snow during an average year. This means that snow on the route during the summer months (june, july and even august) is not uncommon. Whether you are a climber looking for an impressive view of the Central Wasatch, or just passing by this peak on your way to the Pfeifferhorn, stop and check out this mountian for yourself. Trust me it will be worth the 5 minute detour. &lt;div style=\"width: 506px;\" class=\"image-left\" align=\"center\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"/skinning-up-red-pine-fork/607543\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Skinning up Red Pine Fork\" src=\"/images/medium/607543.JPG\" width=\"500\" height=\"375\" unselectable=\"on\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=\"caption\"&gt;Troy skinning up Red Pine Fork enroute to The Little Pfeifferhorn&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div style=\"width: 506px;\" class=\"image-right\" align=\"center\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"/2010-fall-colors-in-little-cottonwood-canyon/671656\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"2010 Fall Colors in Little Cottonwood Canyon\" src=\"/images/medium/671656.JPG\" width=\"500\" height=\"333\" unselectable=\"on\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=\"caption\"&gt;2010 Fall Colors from the Little Cottonwood Canyon Overlook&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;      &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_2\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Getting There&lt;/h2&gt;Starting at the White Pine Trailhead in Little Cottonwood Canyon is the easiest route to the Little Pfeifferhorn. The trail is long (3.3 miles) but gradual (2,200 vertical feet) to the lower Red Pine Lake. If starting from the White Pine Trailhead start by crossing the Little Cottonwood Canyon river. About 1 mile in you will come up on the White Pine Fork river and the trail will split. Choose the right/upper path that crosses the river and continue hiking across White Pine Fork. Soon you will enter Red Pine Fork and get an excellent view down Little Cottonwood Canyon of the Salt Lake City Valley. Keep to this trail while it climbs up/across Red Pine Fork. At an old mine dump you will see a bridge. Do NOT cross the bridge. Keep hiking up Red Pine Fork until the Lower Red Pine Lake comes into view. From here climb up through the boulder fields to the upper Red Pine Lakes. Just before you reach the upper lakes an obvious ridge will lead you up to the summit ridge. From here make a right and the rest of the climb to the summit is simple and scenic.&lt;div style=\"width: 506px;\" class=\"image\" align=\"center\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"/north-cirque-box-elder-peak-utah/508170\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"North Cirque, Box Elder Peak, Utah\" src=\"/images/medium/508170.jpg\" width=\"500\" height=\"333\" unselectable=\"on\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=\"caption\"&gt;The mellow south facing terrain of the Little Pfeifferhorn (Dry Creek Canyon) with Box Elder Peak in the background.

With 600 inches of snowfall a year The Little Pfeifferhorn is a backcountry skiers paradise. The climb is easy, the runs legendary and the views of the Southern and Central Wasatch Range are breath taking to say the least. &lt;br&gt;&lt;div style=\"width: 506px;\" class=\"image-right\" align=\"center\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"/skiing-the-little-pfeifferhorn/607545\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Skiing The Little Pfeifferhorn\" src=\"/images/medium/607545.JPG\" width=\"500\" height=\"375\" unselectable=\"on\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=\"caption\"&gt;Troy skiing The Little Pfeifferhorn&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br&gt;Usually this peak is acended by the standard summer trail via Red Pine Fork. There are 3 main options for decent which are Maybird Gulch, Red Pine Fork and Dry Creek Canyon. The main Northeast Bowl back into Red Pine Fork can get tracked quickly but first tracks here is a must do for anyone backcountry touring in the Central Wasatch. Avalanches are a common threat on and around this peak. Be sure to use safe route travel. Always carry Beacon, Probe, Avalung, Shovel and take a partner with you during your winter travels. &lt;div style=\"width: 476px;\" class=\"image-left\" align=\"center\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"/a-backcountry-no-no/605473\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"A backcountry no no\" src=\"/images/medium/605473.JPG\" width=\"470\" height=\"500\" unselectable=\"on\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=\"caption\"&gt;Two idiots breaking the Golden Rule of Backcountry skiing, which is, ONLY 1 at a time on the slope&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div style=\"width: 506px;\" class=\"image-right\" align=\"center\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"/troy-skiing-red-pine-fork/606186\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Troy skiing Red Pine Fork\" src=\"/images/medium/606186.JPG\" width=\"500\" height=\"311\" unselectable=\"on\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=\"caption\"&gt;Troy skiing The Little Pfeifferhorn&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div style=\"width: 306px;\" class=\"image-left\" align=\"center\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"/troy-vs-little-pfeifferhorn/765965\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Troy vs Little Pfeifferhorn\" src=\"/images/medium/765965.JPG\" width=\"300\" height=\"500\" unselectable=\"on\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=\"caption\"&gt;Troy heading out to drill some of the 1st and only holes of this years ice fishing season.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div style=\"width: 506px;\" class=\"image-right\" align=\"center\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"/lower-red-pine-lake/765966\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Lower Red Pine Lake\" src=\"/images/medium/765966.JPG\" width=\"500\" height=\"426\" unselectable=\"on\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=\"caption\"&gt;Me holding your average Cutthroat Trout at Lower Red Pine Lake&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_4\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Fishing&lt;/h2&gt;Both the Upper and Lower Red Pine Lakes offer outstanding fishing oppertunities. Although the fish rarely exceed 15 inches there are healthy populations of mainly Cutthroat Trout. Every now and then an angler finds a Brook Trout on the end of their line. Because of their mainly insect diet, and high elevation life style, their colors are absolutely beautiful, especially during the spring and fall spawn. Bait is allowed, and the trout limit is only 4 trout per day. A fishing licence is required in the state of Utah. Ice fishing is also possible for the most dedicated of anglers....and it is well worth the effort.&lt;br&gt;&lt;div style=\"width: 306px;\" class=\"image-left\" align=\"center\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"/troy-vs-little-pfeifferhorn/765965\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Troy vs Little Pfeifferhorn\" src=\"/images/medium/765965.JPG\" width=\"300\" height=\"500\" unselectable=\"on\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=\"caption\"&gt;Troy heading out to drill some of the 1st and only holes of this years ice fishing season.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

area of &lt;a href=\"http://www.summitpost.org/area/range/171226/yosemite-national-park.html\"&gt;&lt;font color=\"blue\"&gt;Yosemite National Park&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, California.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;By Tuolumne Standards, Puppy Dome is one of the smallest domes in Yosemite National Park. Next to its big brother &lt;a href=\"http://www.summitpost.org/mountain/rock/151389/lembert-dome.html\"&gt;&lt;font color=\"blue\"&gt;Lembert Dome&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, this dome gets lost between huge pine trees. Most people are so awe-struck by the huge formations this area is so famous for that they walk right past Puppy Dome without realizing that this beautiful little dome is only two hundred feet away hiding in plain sight.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Puppy Dome may be small but you get an unobstructed view of Tuolumne Meadows from its top. Looking east, you get a view of &lt;b&gt;Tioga Pass&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;a href=\"http://www.summitpost.org/mountain/rock/150284/mount-dana.html\"&gt;&lt;font color=\"blue\"&gt;Mount Dana&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Looking west, you get a great view of &lt;a href=\"http://www.summitpost.org/mountain/rock/150524/cathedral-peak.html\"&gt;&lt;font color=\"blue\"&gt;Cathedral Peak&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and Lembert Dome to the north. Getting to the top of Puppy Dome is done by walking on moderately-angled rock slabs of the east face. These slabs may seem easy and comfortable going up, but be sure to keep your head about you when descending. If you slip, you may not be able to stop yourself. Make sure to have proper shoes and test your ability to walk on these slabs by going up and down the first few feet before committing to the whole thing. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;During the summer months the temperatures in Yosemite Valley, at an elevation of 4000 feet, get unbearably hot. These are the months that most Yosemite climbers escape to the cooler, higher altitude granite formations of Tuolumne Meadows. Puppy Dome, at an elevation of 8800 feet, offers several faces and routes for rock climbing as well bouldering. This is a great place for setting up top ropes on the west face of the dome and practicing a number of moderate routes. The upper tier of the west face, very similar to &lt;a href=\"http://www.summitpost.org/mountain/rock/558763/western-front.html\"&gt;&lt;font color=\"blue\"&gt;Western Front&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in technical nature, offers face climbing on knobs typical to Tuolumne Meadows. The lower tier offers a number of easy to moderate cracks such as &lt;b&gt;Puppy Crack&lt;/b&gt;, 5.7, and &lt;b&gt;Battle of The Bulge&lt;/b&gt;, 5.8. For those looking for more difficult routes, they can find them on the south face of Puppy Dome. These routes are in the 5.10 to 5.11 difficulty range. &lt;br&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_2\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Climbing Aspects&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;table border=\"3\" cellpadding=\"5\" cellspacing=\"4\" width=\"80%\" style=\"background-color:999999;border:8px solid green;\"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;div align=\"center\" class=\"image\" style=\"width: 139px;\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"/climbing-on-the-lower-tier/647226\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Climbing on the lower tier\" height=\"200\" width=\"133\" src=\"/images/small/647226.JPG\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=\"caption\"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;div align=\"center\" class=\"image\" style=\"width: 506px;\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"/ed-topping-out-on/647249\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Ed topping out on...\" height=\"332\" width=\"500\" src=\"/images/medium/647249.JPG\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=\"caption\"&gt;Ed topping out on Battle of The Bulge&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;div align=\"center\" class=\"image\" style=\"width: 139px;\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"/puppy-crack/647224\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Puppy Crack\" height=\"200\" width=\"133\" src=\"/images/small/647224.JPG\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=\"caption\"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_3\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How to get there&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;div align=\"center\" class=\"image-left\" style=\"width: 506px;\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"/ranger-station/647219\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Ranger station\" height=\"333\" width=\"500\" src=\"/images/medium/647219.JPG\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=\"caption\"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br&gt;From Highway 395 in California take Highway 120 toward Tioga Pass and Yosemite Valley National Park. This is the eastern entrance to the park. Drive about six miles from the gate to the junction with Tuolumne Lodge. Turn left here and park. During the peak summer season you may need to get lucky to get a parking space. You can drive another half a mile up the road to Lembert Dome Parking lot. There are more spaces available in and around that parking lot. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There is a park ranger office and a bathroom at the Tuolumne Lodge parking. If you look directly south you will see some rocks across a meadow and behind some trees. Unfortunately, there are no established trail for these few hundred feet. Find a trail across the meadow that many climbers have used to get to the dome. Upon reaching the rocks, skirt right to get to the west face rock faces, or skirt left to get to the low angle slabs leading to the top.&lt;br&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_4\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Camping&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;div align=\"center\" class=\"image-left\" style=\"width: 506px;\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"/flowers-near-the-base/643357\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Flowers near the base\" height=\"333\" width=\"500\" src=\"/images/medium/643357.JPG\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=\"caption\"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;There are many campgrounds in the Tuolumne Meadows and Tioga Pass area. During the peak season, however, it&rsquo;s possible that you end up driving from campground to campground looking for a campsite to no avail. It&rsquo;s important to remember that you can always camp close to Tuolumne Meadows without being in the heart of it. There are a number of campgrounds along Highway 120, Tioga Pass Road, that can be used. There are also a number of camgrounds along Highway 395 and in the Mammoth Lakes area. It&rsquo;s always a good idea to plan ahead and the following links should help a little.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://www.nps.gov/yose/planyourvisit/tmcamp.htm\"&gt;Tuolumne Meadows Camping&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://www.trails.com/tcatalog_trail.aspx?trailid=HGS259-336&amp;amp;Source=YSSP&amp;amp;oc=6000&amp;amp;utm_source=yahoo&amp;amp;utm_medium=ssp&amp;amp;utm_campaign=yssp_catalogtrail&amp;amp;track=1\"&gt;Saddle Bag Campground&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://www.thesierraweb.com/recreation/camping.cfm\"&gt;The Sierra Web/Camping&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Mono Lake Station-  760-647-3000&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Rush Creek, Mammoth Lakes Station-  760-924-5500&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_5\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Images&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div align=\"center\"&gt;&lt;table id=\"my_images\"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/climbing-on-the-lower-tier/647231/c-647234\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Climbing on the lower tier\" src=\"/images/square/647231.JPG\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/puppy-crack/647224/c-647234\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Puppy Crack\" src=\"/images/square/647224.JPG\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/climbing-on-the-lower-tier/647226/c-647234\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Climbing on the lower tier\" src=\"/images/square/647226.JPG\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/lembert-dome/647250/c-647234\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Lembert Dome...\" src=\"/images/square/647250.JPG\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/north-face-of-puppy-dome/647230/c-647234\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"North Face of Puppy Dome\" src=\"/images/square/647230.JPG\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/approach-to-east-slabs/647260/c-647234\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Approach to east slabs\" src=\"/images/square/647260.JPG\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/lembert-dome-from-the-east-slabs/647562/c-647234\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Lembert Dome from the east slabs\" src=\"/images/square/647562.JPG\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/ed-topping-out-on/647249/c-647234\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Ed topping out on...\" src=\"/images/square/647249.JPG\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/approach-to-base-of-the-upper-tier/647559/c-647234\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Approach to base of the upper tier\" src=\"/images/square/647559.JPG\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/upper-tier/647552/c-647234\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Upper tier\" src=\"/images/square/647552.JPG\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/many-bouldering-possibilities/647259/c-647234\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Many bouldering possibilities...\" src=\"/images/square/647259.JPG\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/left-side/647556/c-647234\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Left side\" src=\"/images/square/647556.JPG\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/crack-system-on-the-lower-tier/647564/c-647234\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Crack system on the lower tier\" src=\"/images/square/647564.JPG\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/a-meadow/647548/c-647234\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"A meadow... \" src=\"/images/square/647548.JPG\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td colspan=\"7\" align=\"center\"&gt;[ &lt;a href=\"/puppy-dome/images/p-647234\"&gt;View Gallery - 4 More Images&lt;/a&gt; ]&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/article&gt;date:difficulty:'),(154,650446,'/mount-florence/650446','/yosemite-national-park/171226','Mount Florence','','','','12561','',11788,37.7398,-119.316,'California, United States, North America','','',171226,'Yosemite National Park','','','','Spring, Summer, Fall','','Mountain-Rock','content: &lt;article&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_1\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2 id=\"first_h2\"&gt;Overview&lt;/h2&gt;Mount Florence is a remote and isolated peak deep in the Yosemite backcountry, and ranks as the &lt;a href=\"http://www.summitpost.org/yosemite-s-highest-peaks/742800\"&gt;tenth highest in the national park&lt;/a&gt;.  Trips generally involve at least 3 miles of cross-country travel each way, and a roundtrip outing requires a minimum of 26 miles from the closest trailhead and 6,000 feet total elevation gain.  The journey promises incredible scenery throughout all approaches and includes excellent destinations even if not heading for the top.  The trailhead is one of the most popular in Yosemite National Park, but as you pass Vogelsang or exit Lyell Canyon you are likely to find vast areas of complete seclusion even on a busy summer weekend.  In addition to the scenic approaches, the views from the summit are also outstanding.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Nearby peaks that are visible and sometimes climbed with Mount Florence include &lt;a href=\"http://www.summitpost.org/mountain/rock/154592/parsons-peak.html\"&gt;Parsons Peak&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"http://www.summitpost.org/mountain/rock/151893/simmons-peak.html\"&gt;Simmons Peak&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"http://www.summitpost.org/mountain/rock/151700/vogelsang-peak.html\"&gt;Vogelsang Peak&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"http://www.summitpost.org/mountain/rock/151703/fletcher-peak.html\"&gt;Fletcher Peak&lt;/a&gt;.  The summit vista also includes a direct view of Mount Lyell and Mount Maclure, the Clark Range, and the east side of Half Dome rising over Yosemite Valley.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;div class=\"thumb\"&gt;&lt;div style=\"width:742px;\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=650428\"&gt;&lt;img width=\"740\" src=\"/images/large/650428.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;div class=\"thumbcaption\"&gt;&lt;div class=\"magnify\" style=\"float: right;\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=%20650428\" title=\"Enlarge\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/layout/abby/magnify.gif\" alt=\"Enlarge\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;Mount Florence Summit Vista (click to view labeled peaks)&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_2\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Getting There&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;div align=\"center\" class=\"image-right\" style=\"width: 206px;\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"/lewis-creek-basin/650413\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Lewis Creek Basin\" height=\"150\" width=\"200\" src=\"/images/small/650413.JPG\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=\"caption\"&gt;Lewis Creek Basin&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;  &lt;div align=\"center\" class=\"image-left\" style=\"width: 121px;\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"/mount-florence-and-simmons-peak-route-map/650411\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Mount Florence and Simmons Peak Route Map\" height=\"200\" width=\"115\" src=\"/images/small/650411.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=\"caption\"&gt;Route Map&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br&gt;The shortest and usual route options for Mount Florence all begin at the southbound John Muir Trail Trailhead near Tuolumne Meadows in Yosemite National Park.  Depending on your selection, your path will either continue through Lyell Canyon or follow Rafferty Creek towards Vogelsang.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Lyell Canyon/Rafferty Creek&lt;/b&gt; (37.87790&deg; N, 119.33873&deg; W)&lt;br&gt;From either the east or the west, follow Highway 120 into Yosemite National Park until reaching Tuolumne Meadows Lodge Road near Lembert Dome (6 miles west of Tioga Pass and 0.5 miles east of Tuolumne Meadows Campground).  Signs here mark the location of the wilderness permit ranger station.  You can either park at the ranger station, or continue down the road another 0.4 miles to the large trailhead parking area on the left.&lt;br clear=\"ALL\"&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_3\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Approaches&lt;/h2&gt;The approaches listed here follow the John Muir Trail south from Tuolumne Meadows, turning south at Rafferty Creek or continuing through Lyell Canyon to Ireland Creek.  Since each option involves the same trailhead, a loop trip is easily possible.  Other approaches can be done from many other trailheads, including Tenaya Lake, Yosemite Valley, and Glacier Point among others.  These alternate approaches generally involve 30-50% more distance and elevation gain.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;table align=\"center\" border=\"1\" bordercolor=\"#FFFFFF\" bgcolor=\"#DDDDDD\" cellpadding=\"5\" cellspacing=\"0\" width=\"90%\"&gt;&lt;tr bgcolor=\"#444444\"&gt;&lt;th&gt;&lt;font color=\"#FFFFFF\"&gt;Route&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/th&gt;&lt;th&gt;&lt;font color=\"#FFFFFF\"&gt;Distance&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/th&gt;&lt;th&gt;&lt;font color=\"#FFFFFF\"&gt;Gain&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/th&gt;&lt;th&gt;&lt;font color=\"#FFFFFF\"&gt;Description&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/th&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;b&gt;Florence Creek via Vogelsang Pass&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;13.2 miles one-way&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;5,050 feet&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;+1,200 feet on return&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;This is perhaps the quickest and easiest approach.  Follow the John Muir Trail south from the parking area 1.5 miles to the Rafferty Creek Trail junction and turn south (right) towards Vogelsang.  The trail gains elevation gradually to Tuolumne Pass, past Vogelsang High Sierra Camp (the cause of the copious quantities of horse manure covering the path), and over Vogelsang Pass before dropping to Lewis Creek.  Shortly after the Bernice Lake Trail junction, 10 miles from the trailhead, leave the trail and head cross-country over easy terrain towards the basin north of Mount Florence as indicated on the map.  Upon entering the basin the first imposing views of the peak become visible.  Cross the basin to Lake 10541, wrapping around the south shore to the northwest chute. &lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;b&gt;Lewis Creek via Vogelsang Pass&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;14.2 miles one-way&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;5,400 feet&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;+1,550 feet on return&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Lewis Creek Basin is very scenic and a good option if also climbing nearby Simmons Peak.  Follow the description above to Vogelsang Pass, but leave the trail approximately one mile earlier, about 400 feet below south side of the pass (as soon as a traverse towards Gallison Lake and Lewis Creek becomes feasible).  Gallison Lake has excellent camping options and views of Simmons Peak.  Continue cross-country to the head of the basin, turning south past Simmons Peak and drop down into the basin east of Mount Florence.  From here, traverse to the south ridge.&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;b&gt;Lewis Creek via Ireland Lake&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;15.5 miles one-way&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;5,600 feet&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;+1,750 feet on return&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;An approach via Ireland Lake is a good option if climbing nearby Parsons Peak, Amelia Earhart Peak, or Simmons Peak.  Instead of turning south towards Vogelsang at the Rafferty Creek Trail junction, continue straight through Lyell Canyon until reaching the Ireland Lake junction 6 miles from the trailhead.  Follow the trail another 4 miles to Ireland Lake, a fantastic grassy area with excellent views of the surrounding peaks.  Head south around the lake&rsquo;s east shore towards the pass southeast of Parsons Peak, then into Lewis Creek Basin and joining the Lewis Creek route described above.&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_4\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Summit Routes&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;table align=\"center\" border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"3\"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://www.summitpost.org/view_object.php?object_id=650415\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"http://c0278592.cdn.cloudfiles.rackspacecloud.com/thumb/650415.JPG\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;b&gt;West Ridge &ndash; Class 2&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Follow the south shoreline of Lake 10541 near the head of Florence Creek until reaching the lake&rsquo;s midpoint, directly below the saddle between Mount Florence and Point 11361.  It is easiest to keep at lake level until reaching this location, rather than traversing upwards immediately.  From the lake head south over class 2 talus and boulders to the saddle.  Most of the ridge is sandy with plenty of rocks scattered between until near the false summit, where larger boulders are encountered.&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://www.summitpost.org/view_object.php?object_id=650414\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"http://c0278592.cdn.cloudfiles.rackspacecloud.com/thumb/650414.JPG\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;b&gt;South Ridge &ndash; Class 3&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Secor suggests climbing the ridge from the south rather than heading directly up the east slope if you are above Hutchings Creek.  The east slope is suggested to be loose class 3, and looks very doable from a distance, but my experience indicated that a lot of routefinding and backtracking might be necessary and, as suggested, the south ridge a better option (especially if descending).  Simply climb to the saddle between Mount Florence and Point 11647 and head up the car and bus size boulders to the summit.  There is no exposure, but numerous class 3 moves are needed just to navigate through the rocks to the top.&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_5\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Red Tape&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;div align=\"center\" class=\"image-right\" style=\"width: 506px;\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"/mount-florence-east-ridge/650427\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Mount Florence East Ridge\" height=\"375\" width=\"500\" src=\"/images/medium/650427.JPG\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=\"caption\"&gt;Mount Florence from the East&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Entrance Fees:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Access to Mount Florence lies in Yosemite National Park and an entrance fee is required.  The &lt;a href=\"http://www.nps.gov/yose/planyourvisit/feesandreservations.htm\"&gt;Yosemite fee page&lt;/a&gt; has full details.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Wilderness Permits:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Permits are required for overnight trips, but be aware that Yosemite has perhaps the worst permit pickup process in all of California.  After hours pickup is not available, and if arriving in the morning expect to wait in line 1 &frac12; to 2 hours even with a reservation.  Permits can be picked up at the Tuolumne Meadows Wilderness Center near the trailhead during open hours.  This is one of the most popular trailheads in Yosemite, and subject to &lt;a href=\"http://www.nps.gov/yose/planyourvisit/trailheads.htm\"&gt;quotas&lt;/a&gt;, so if seeking a permit reservations far in advance are highly recommended.    Check the &lt;a href=\"http://www.nps.gov/yose/planyourvisit/wildpermits.htm\"&gt;Yosemite permit page&lt;/a&gt; for full details on hours, the reservation process, and reservation availability.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Food Storage:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Bear canisters are required throughout Yosemite National Park.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Campfires:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Fires are prohibited above 9,600 feet.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Yosemite National Park Wilderness Permit Office&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;PO Box 545&lt;br&gt;Yosemite, CA 95389&lt;br&gt;Phone: (209) 372-0740 &lt;br&gt;Fax: (209) 372-0739&lt;br clear=\"ALL\"&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_6\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Current Conditions&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://forecast.weather.gov/MapClick.php?lat=37.740584788858285&amp;amp;lon=-119.31838989257812\"&gt;Current NOAA / National Weather Service Forecast&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;table border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"0\"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://www.wunderground.com/cgi-bin/findweather/getForecast?query=zmw:95389.3.99999&amp;amp;bannertypeclick=wu_clean2day\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"http://weathersticker.wunderground.com/weathersticker/cgi-bin/banner/ban/wxBanner?bannertype=wu_clean2day_cond&amp;amp;airportcode=KMMH&amp;amp;ForcedCity=Tuolumne%20Meadows&amp;amp;ForcedState=CA&amp;amp;zipcode=95389&amp;amp;language=EN\" alt=\"Click for Tuolumne Meadows, California Forecast\" height=\"100\" width=\"300\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;br clear=\"ALL\"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_7\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;When to Climb&lt;/h2&gt;Tioga pass is not plowed in the winter, and overnight parking is not permitted after October 15.

Excellent options include Lewis Creek Basin, Florence Creek Basin, and Ireland Lake among many others.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Roadside camping is not permitted in Yosemite.  Established &lt;a href=\"http://www.nps.gov/yose/planyourvisit/tmcamp.htm\"&gt;Tuolumne Meadows Campground&lt;/a&gt; in Yosemite has just over 300 sites and is within walking distance of the trailhead.  Reservations are recommended, though half of the sites are first-come, first-serve.  There is also a walk-in backpackers&rsquo; camping area within the campground.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Inyo National Forest hosts a few first-come, first-serve campgrounds just east of the park near Tioga pass, and more numerous sites in Lee Vining Canyon.

The pinnacles have been unofficially named for characters in JR Tolkien\'s &lt;i&gt;Lord of the Rings&lt;/i&gt;, with Gandalf Peak being the highest of the 12. Lying on the boundary between Sequoia/Kings Canyon NP and the John Muir Wilderness, it is one of the more difficult summits in the region. Because it lies some 500ft lower than the prominent 14ers found on either side, it has been historically overlooked by climbers, and even today sees much less traffic than the nearby peaks. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Class 4 by its easiest route, the peak wasn\'t climbed until 1954 when John and Ruth Mendenhall climbed the three easternmost pinnacles (II, 5.7). The highpoint, Gandalf Peak, located on the far west end, wasn\'t climbed until 1967 by Don Jensen of the Palisade School of Mountaineering (via the class 4 NE Face). Don also pioneered the class 4 NW Ridge and was the first person to complete the traverse of all 12 pinnacles (III, 5.5) in 1969.&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;table class=\"inline_image_thumbs\"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=78501\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/78501.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=78498\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/78498.JPG\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_2\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Getting There&lt;/h2&gt;Take US395 to Big Pine. Drive west on the Glacier Lodge Rd to the end. Overnight parking is clearly marked, and lies furthest from the trailhead, just before the pack station. Dayhikers can drive to the end of the road and park in any of the appropriately marked spaces. Take the South Fork Trail to the turnoff to Willow Lake. There is no maintained trail past the signed turnoff, but use trails can be used to avoid much tedious cross country travel. A use trail follows close to the south side of the creek until just before the bog/marsh marked on the maps on the south side of the creek where a side stream from the south enters (this is the stream draining the north side of Palisade Crest). Cross over to the north side, hike upstream over boulders to the next stream confluence. Follow one of two drainages up to Elinore Lake. The right side has some evidence of use trail, but both routes seem to take about the same time. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;From the south in the vicinity of Deer Meadow, hike up Glacier Creek several thousand feet to Lake 3559m. Then climb NNE to Scimitar Pass and the Northwest Ridge up much talus and boulders. From Palisade Lakes, Lake 3559m can be reached via Cirque Pass (class 3), to the west of the lowest of the Palisade Lakes. From Bishop Pass, the easiest route to Lake 3559m is via Thunderbolt Pass and Potluck Pass. This route avoids much elevation loss to the JMT, but requires much cross-country travel over boulder and talus.&lt;br&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_3\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Red Tape &amp;amp; Mountain Conditions&lt;/h2&gt;Overnight permits are required and quotas for the South Fork of Big Pine Creek are in effect from May 15 to September 15. The South Fork is far less popular than the North Fork trail, so getting permits is not usually a problem.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Those approaching from the south will be travelling through and camping in SeKi National Park, also requiring permits.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Everything you need to know about conditions, permits and regulations can be found on the &lt;a href=\"http://www.summitpost.org/show/mountain_link.pl/mountain_id/4859\"&gt;Eastern Sierra - Logisitcal Center&lt;/a&gt; page.&lt;br&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_4\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;When To Climb&lt;/h2&gt;May to October are the usual climbing months. Early in the year there is much snow (and considerably more gear to carry).&lt;br&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_5\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Camping&lt;/h2&gt;Camping is allowed in most places of the SEKI and John Muir Wildernesses that surround Palisade Crest. For north side approaches, by far the most popular camp location is found along the shores of Elinore Lake. With shade and easy access to water, Elinore Lake is only about 1 1/2 miles from the summit.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;On the south side, suitable campsites can be found along the John Muir Trail in the vicinity of Palisade Lakes or lower down in Deer Creek Meadow where Glacier Creek joins Palisade Creek. Higher campsites in more barren surroundings can be found in Palisade Basin or along the shores of Lake 3559m. &lt;br&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_6\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Etymology&lt;/h2&gt;\"The Palisades were named by the &lt;a href=\"http://www.snwburd.com/bob/etymology/brewer.html\"&gt;Brewer&lt;/a&gt; party of the &lt;a href=\"http://www.snwburd.com/bob/etymology/whitney.html\"&gt;Whitney&lt;/a&gt; Survey in 1864. \'... along the Main crest of the Sierra, is a range of peaks, from 13,500 to 14,000 feet high, which we called \"the Palisades.\" ... they were very grand and fantastic in shape.\' (Whitney, &lt;i&gt;Geology&lt;/i&gt;, 393.)\" &lt;br&gt;- &lt;b&gt;Peter Browning, &lt;i&gt;Place Names of the Sierra Nevada&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_7\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Images&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div align=\"center\"&gt;&lt;table id=\"my_images\"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/palisade-crest-viewed-from/78501/c-153354\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Palisade Crest viewed from...\" src=\"/images/square/78501.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/michael-at-the-bottom-of-the/78499/c-153354\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\" Michael at the bottom of the...\" src=\"/images/square/78499.JPG\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/sierra-backbone/638746/c-153354\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Sierra Backbone\" src=\"/images/square/638746.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/michael-traverses-towards/78497/c-153354\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\" Michael traverses towards...\" src=\"/images/square/78497.JPG\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/finally-turns/470738/c-153354\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Finally, turns!\" src=\"/images/square/470738.JPG\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/michael-matthew-and-mark/78495/c-153354\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\" Michael , Matthew , and Mark...\" src=\"/images/square/78495.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/fun-little-chute/470736/c-153354\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\" Fun Little Chute\" src=\"/images/square/470736.JPG\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/palisade-crest-and-the/78493/c-153354\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Palisade Crest and the...\" src=\"/images/square/78493.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/the-approach-to-the-northwest/78494/c-153354\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"The approach to the Northwest...\" src=\"/images/square/78494.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/back-on-the-ridge/331018/c-153354\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"back on the ridge\" src=\"/images/square/331018.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/palisade-crest-viewed-from/78500/c-153354\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Palisade Crest viewed from...\" src=\"/images/square/78500.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/palisade-crest/735556/c-153354\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Palisade Crest\" src=\"/images/square/735556.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/matthew-ponders-the-160-foot/78496/c-153354\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\" Matthew ponders the 160-foot...\" src=\"/images/square/78496.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/south-fork-big-pine-canyon/735557/c-153354\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"South Fork Big Pine Canyon\" src=\"/images/square/735557.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td colspan=\"7\" align=\"center\"&gt;[ &lt;a href=\"/palisade-crest/images/p-153354\"&gt;View Gallery - 12 More Images&lt;/a&gt; ]&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/article&gt;date:difficulty:'),(156,165762,'/lisa-falls/165762','/little-cottonwood-canyon/154313','Lisa Falls','Trad Climbing, Sport Climbing, Toprope','','','6800','',13624,40.5741,-111.727,'Utah, United States, North America','','',154313,'Little Cottonwood Canyon','','','','Spring, Summer, Fall','','Mountain-Rock','content: &lt;article&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_1\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2 id=\"first_h2\"&gt;Approach&lt;/h2&gt;Park at a turnout on either side of the road 2.8 miles up the canyon from the neon sign and the Park N&rsquo; Ride. At the pullout on the north (left) side of the road there is a distinct trail that heads up a shaded wash. Follow this trail, and in about 100 yards you will reach the falls. Once they are in sight, keep an eye out for a fork in the trail. The feint right fork leads to a series of climbs under a large roof a ways right of the falls. The more prominent left fork passes by a large boulder (convenient for sitting, leaving gear, and roping up), cuts around the backside, and crosses the stream right beneath the falls to reach the base of the routes on the left of the falls.&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;table class=\"inline_image_thumbs\"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=113867\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/113867.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_2\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Route Description&lt;/h2&gt;Lisa Falls is a great place to climb Spring through Fall, any time of day. The base is well shaded by trees and offers many flat places to belay, or just hang out and relax. The roaring waterfall gives the place a nice atmosphere, while the spray of water and its ensuing breeze also help keep the area cool.  The routes here climb granite polished smooth as snot, holdless friction faces, clean cracks, and juggy overhangs. Also, the views of Little Cottonwood Canyon and the lower slopes of North Thunder Mountain are wonderful.  &lt;p&gt;  If you climb above the falls there are more routes on the vertical granite walls of the gorge, called The Freedom Wall. If you keep climbing, you can climb the Broads Fork Twin Peaks via the &lt;a href=\"http://www.summitpost.org/mountains/route_link.pl?route_id=2769&amp;amp;object_id=390\"&gt;Lisa Falls Direct&lt;/a&gt;, a very nice mountaineering route up the peak.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;  The slabs recline at such an angle that the routes look shorter than they really are, and they also look much easier than they really are, so be careful! One possible drawback to the area is that it is also popular among Salt Lake Residents for an afternoon hangout. Some climbers may be irritated by gawkers within such a short distance. Also, the occasional loiterer sometimes turns into a foolish free-soloer. I&rsquo;ve had more than one occasion when visitors exploring the cliffs above knocked large rocks down, landing in the belay areas with absolutely no warning &ndash; keep an eye out for these sorts of people!  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;

The bolted anchors on the far side of the falls can be used to top-rope Lisa Falls Left (5.8 R), Sweet Spot (5.8+ R), and Sweep Left (5.10b). These can be reached by scrambling up a vegetated gulley to the left of the routes.  The anchors may seem to be in a place with high rope drag, but they&rsquo;re actually set to hold the rope above a bulge lower down and therefore do not generate much rope drag unless the anchor point is set too low &ndash; have faith and use normal runners on the anchor. Climbers can lower the 82&rsquo; to the bottom or walk off these climbs.  &lt;p&gt;  The next set of bolts are found to the right of the falls on a roof &ndash; &lt;i&gt;NOT AS SHOWN IN THE GUIDEBOOK!&lt;/i&gt; This is used as an anchor for Flee Flicker (5.7), Fleeting Glimpse (5.8+), and Lisa Falls Right (5.5). It is in an awkward place for belaying a Second as the belayer is half-hanging on the anchor and must lap-coil the rope. It is also in a bad place to begin Hard Knocks (5.9+) and the continuation of Lisa Falls Right. To continue on these, one must belay the second pitch from an old set of bolts with rap rings (shown as the only anchor in the guidebook) about 15 feet down on a nicer ledge. I assume the current anchor with chains is the one in use because it introduces less rope drag for climbers top-roping the first pitch climbs. Climbers must lower or rap the 65&rsquo; from this anchor.   &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;  Another set of bolts are found another 68&rsquo; above the anchor on the roof. From here, two rapps with a single rope (or one rap with a double) can be done, or with a little more climbing, the routes can be walked off to the south east.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;  Finally, there are a set of bolts above a large roof around the corner from the falls at the base of a small tree. Descents are made by lowering or rapelling.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;table class=\"inline_image_thumbs\"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=113859\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/113859.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=113860\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/113860.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=113861\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/113861.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=113863\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/113863.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_4\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Lisa Falls Left - 5.8 R&lt;/h2&gt;This route follows a groove, which turns into a small crack higher up.  This route is mostly unprotected, so most people top-rope it.  &lt;p&gt;  See Photos &lt;a href=\"http://www.summitpost.org/mountains/photo_link.pl?photo_id=166180&amp;amp;object_id=5136&amp;amp;type=mountain&amp;amp;mountain_id=5136&amp;amp;route_id=\"&gt;(1)&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"http://www.summitpost.org/mountains/photo_link.pl?photo_id=166181&amp;amp;object_id=5136&amp;amp;type=mountain&amp;amp;mountain_id=5136&amp;amp;route_id=\"&gt;(2)&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;br&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_5\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Sweet Spot - 5.8+ R&lt;/h2&gt;This route also has poor protection and slippery rock and is usually top-roped. Follow Lisa Falls Left and step right into a crescent-shaped ledge. There is a single bolt here that can be clipped for protection before launching up the finger-tip crack.  &lt;p&gt;  See Photos &lt;a href=\"http://www.summitpost.org/mountains/photo_link.pl?photo_id=166180&amp;amp;object_id=5136&amp;amp;type=mountain&amp;amp;mountain_id=5136&amp;amp;route_id=\"&gt;(1)&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"http://www.summitpost.org/mountains/photo_link.pl?photo_id=166181&amp;amp;object_id=5136&amp;amp;type=mountain&amp;amp;mountain_id=5136&amp;amp;route_id=\"&gt;(2)&lt;/a&gt;    &lt;br&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_6\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Sweep Left - 5.10b&lt;/h2&gt;The crux of this route is below the first bolt, within 8 ft of the ground. The crux is a sheet extremely slick polished granite. I&rsquo;ve climbed it once &ndash; it required reaching VERY far and high with the feet, with very careful, smooth, and slow standing. In frustration, I&rsquo;ve gotten a running start from the ground and managed to run past the crux, only to fail to get a grip above it :-D . Beyond this crux, a fun roof is surmounted, and three more bolts are clipped as you climb out onto a friction face with micro-flakes for footholds. The fingerholds here consisted of shoving the fat into a hole or on a flake corner, and were only useful for steadying the upper body when standing.  &lt;p&gt;  See Photos &lt;a href=\"http://www.summitpost.org/mountains/photo_link.pl?photo_id=166180&amp;amp;object_id=5136&amp;amp;type=mountain&amp;amp;mountain_id=5136&amp;amp;route_id=\"&gt;(1)&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"http://www.summitpost.org/mountains/photo_link.pl?photo_id=166181&amp;amp;object_id=5136&amp;amp;type=mountain&amp;amp;mountain_id=5136&amp;amp;route_id=\"&gt;(2)&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;br&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_7\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Flee Flicker - 5.7+&lt;/h2&gt;Climb three bolts to the right of the falls for this fun sport route. The rock is polished and the crux is around the first bolt. Higher up, the climbing is easer slightly to the left of the route on rougher rock. There really isn&rsquo;t anything to grab with your hands on this route.  &lt;p&gt;  See Photos &lt;a href=\"http://www.summitpost.org/mountains/photo_link.pl?photo_id=166185&amp;amp;object_id=5136&amp;amp;type=mountain&amp;amp;mountain_id=5136&amp;amp;route_id=\"&gt;(1)&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"http://www.summitpost.org/mountains/photo_link.pl?photo_id=166187&amp;amp;object_id=5136&amp;amp;type=mountain&amp;amp;mountain_id=5136&amp;amp;route_id=\"&gt;(2)&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"http://www.summitpost.org/mountains/photo_link.pl?photo_id=166189&amp;amp;object_id=5136&amp;amp;type=mountain&amp;amp;mountain_id=5136&amp;amp;route_id=\"&gt;(3)&lt;/a&gt;    &lt;br&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_8\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Fleeting Glimpse - 5.8+&lt;/h2&gt;The next line of three bolts to the right of Flee Flicker. The crux is lower down on a fingertip lieback and polished granite. Above this is a runout over a bulge to reach the second bolt.  &lt;p&gt;  See Photos &lt;a href=\"http://www.summitpost.org/mountains/photo_link.pl?photo_id=166185&amp;amp;object_id=5136&amp;amp;type=mountain&amp;amp;mountain_id=5136&amp;amp;route_id=\"&gt;(1)&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"http://www.summitpost.org/mountains/photo_link.pl?photo_id=166187&amp;amp;object_id=5136&amp;amp;type=mountain&amp;amp;mountain_id=5136&amp;amp;route_id=\"&gt;(2)&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"http://www.summitpost.org/mountains/photo_link.pl?photo_id=166189&amp;amp;object_id=5136&amp;amp;type=mountain&amp;amp;mountain_id=5136&amp;amp;route_id=\"&gt;(3)&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;br&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_9\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Lisa Falls Right - 5.5&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Pitch 1:&lt;/b&gt;  A fun two-pitch trad route. Follow a rounded crack to the right onto a ledge. From here an unprotected 5.5 mantle move is the crux, with easier climbing above. I reccoment stopping at the two bolts with rap rings and belaying from here, unless you&rsquo;re planning on lowering down the first pitch.  &lt;p&gt;  &lt;b&gt;Pitch 2:&lt;/b&gt;  Really fun. Do an ascending traverse to the right to gain a long crack to the right of a large rust-colored slab. The crack is a fun continuous lieback for 20-30 ft (5.4) before reaching the next bolt anchor. The crack is parallel and straight, so cams would be helpful here, although I managed to get a couple of hexes in with some finagling. Descend the route in two rapps or climb a little higher and walk off.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;  See Photos &lt;a href=\"http://www.summitpost.org/mountains/photo_link.pl?photo_id=166185&amp;amp;object_id=5136&amp;amp;type=mountain&amp;amp;mountain_id=5136&amp;amp;route_id=\"&gt;(1)&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"http://www.summitpost.org/mountains/photo_link.pl?photo_id=166189&amp;amp;object_id=5136&amp;amp;type=mountain&amp;amp;mountain_id=5136&amp;amp;route_id=\"&gt;(2)&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"http://www.summitpost.org/mountains/photo_link.pl?photo_id=166187&amp;amp;object_id=5136&amp;amp;type=mountain&amp;amp;mountain_id=5136&amp;amp;route_id=\"&gt;(3)&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"http://www.summitpost.org/mountains/photo_link.pl?photo_id=166186&amp;amp;object_id=5136&amp;amp;type=mountain&amp;amp;mountain_id=5136&amp;amp;route_id=\"&gt;(4)&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;br&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_10\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Lefty - 5.4&lt;/h2&gt;This route heads out left beneath the roof that the first set of chained anchors are on. There&rsquo;s not much to note for this variation, except you can walk off from the top.  &lt;p&gt;  See Photos &lt;a href=\"http://www.summitpost.org/mountains/photo_link.pl?photo_id=166185&amp;amp;object_id=5136&amp;amp;type=mountain&amp;amp;mountain_id=5136&amp;amp;route_id=\"&gt;(1)&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"http://www.summitpost.org/mountains/photo_link.pl?photo_id=166189&amp;amp;object_id=5136&amp;amp;type=mountain&amp;amp;mountain_id=5136&amp;amp;route_id=\"&gt;(2)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_11\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Hard Knocks - 5.9+&lt;/h2&gt;Climb the face left of the dihedral on the second pitch of Lisa Falls Right. It is rust-colored and polished. It is protected with one bolt above a good ledge, but it can also be top roped from the bolted anchors above. There are some possibilites to place pro before reaching the bolt, but after that, you\'re on your own. Fun climb on thin holds on superslick rock over 60 ft off the deck!  &lt;p&gt;  See Photos &lt;a href=\"http://www.summitpost.org/mountains/photo_link.pl?photo_id=166185&amp;amp;object_id=5136&amp;amp;type=mountain&amp;amp;mountain_id=5136&amp;amp;route_id=\"&gt;(1)&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"http://www.summitpost.org/mountains/photo_link.pl?photo_id=166189&amp;amp;object_id=5136&amp;amp;type=mountain&amp;amp;mountain_id=5136&amp;amp;route_id=\"&gt;(2)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_12\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Neurotica - 5.5&lt;/h2&gt;This climb starts out in the same spot as Lisa Falls Right, but rather than cutting left, continue up to the right of a roof, climbing a fun finger-crack that dead-ends into a roof. There is currently a nut permanently lodged in the crack right before the roof, and right now it still looks good to use, although I protected the crack a little earlier as well. From here, climb over the roof (5.5). Protection above this was sketchy, and I could only find one shallow, somewhat flaring crack to place a Size 1 Metolius Cam (or a BD 0.3).   &lt;p&gt;  Above the roof is a runout along a seam, angling right before cutting left to reach the 5.4 dihedral via some friction face climbing.  Your next opportunity for placing pro after the roof is at the dihedral!  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;  Finally, climb up the 5.4 dihedral (cams work best here, but hexes can get you by) to reach the anchor bolts. The route is a full pitch, taking about 165\' of rope.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;  See Photos &lt;a href=\"http://www.summitpost.org/mountains/photo_link.pl?photo_id=166185&amp;amp;object_id=5136&amp;amp;type=mountain&amp;amp;mountain_id=5136&amp;amp;route_id=\"&gt;(1)&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"http://www.summitpost.org/mountains/photo_link.pl?photo_id=166186&amp;amp;object_id=5136&amp;amp;type=mountain&amp;amp;mountain_id=5136&amp;amp;route_id=\"&gt;(2)&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;br&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_13\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Safety Blitz - 5.7&lt;/h2&gt;From the trail that heads to the roof area, follow the granite slab left. Start here and climb along the edge of a step and through a notch in the roof (5.7), which I personally think is more like a 5.6 move. From here, lower off of the chains, or continue along the flake, traversing over to a seam on the left, and passing under a roof to reach the set of bolts atop the second pitch of Lisa Falls Right (which is a full pitch of trad climbing).  &lt;p&gt;  See Photo &lt;a href=\"http://www.summitpost.org/mountains/photo_link.pl?photo_id=166194&amp;amp;object_id=5136&amp;amp;type=mountain&amp;amp;mountain_id=5136&amp;amp;route_id=5825\"&gt;(1)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_14\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Drag Queen - 5.8+&lt;/h2&gt;Climb up onto the first ledge, and then climb over the roof to the right of Under the Skirt via a right-leaning crack. You can clip the hidden bolt from Under the Skirt right before the crack.  There is a stuck nut in this crack, that is in solid and looks new.   &lt;p&gt;  If you top-rope this, be careful. You are enough to the side of the anchor that you could pendulum into the roof - wear a helmet or don\'t fall!  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;  See Photos &lt;a href=\"http://www.summitpost.org/mountains/photo_link.pl?photo_id=166192&amp;amp;object_id=5136&amp;amp;type=mountain&amp;amp;mountain_id=5136&amp;amp;route_id=5825\"&gt;(1)&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"http://www.summitpost.org/mountains/photo_link.pl?photo_id=166194&amp;amp;object_id=5136&amp;amp;type=mountain&amp;amp;mountain_id=5136&amp;amp;route_id=5825\"&gt;(2)&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_15\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Essential Gear&lt;/h2&gt;Most of the routes here are either top-roped or are sport climbs, so some slings and a set of 5 or 6 quickdraws should be plenty. For the trad routes, bring a variety of nut sizes, as the cracks vary a lot in their size! Also, cams would be nice, but aren&rsquo;t crucial, for climbing the 20 ft crack on Lisa Falls Right.&lt;br&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_16\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Other Info&lt;/h2&gt;If you have additional info for routes described or have done a route not described in depth, please put the info here and I\'ll integrate it into the page!&lt;br&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_17\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Images&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div align=\"center\"&gt;&lt;table id=\"my_images\"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/july-3rd-2005-in-the/113867/c-165762\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"July 3rd, 2005 - In the...\" src=\"/images/square/113867.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/lisa-falls/969501/c-165762\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Lisa Falls\" src=\"/images/square/969501.JPG\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/july-3rd-2005-the-main/113859/c-165762\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"July 3rd, 2005 - The main...\" src=\"/images/square/113859.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/june-25th-2005-the-routes/113855/c-165762\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"June 25th, 2005 - The routes...\" src=\"/images/square/113855.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/july-3rd-2005-the-routes/113856/c-165762\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"July 3rd, 2005 - The routes...\" src=\"/images/square/113856.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/july-3rd-2005-the-main/113860/c-165762\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"July 3rd, 2005 - The main...\" src=\"/images/square/113860.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/july-3rd-2005-the-main/113861/c-165762\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"July 3rd, 2005 - The main...\" src=\"/images/square/113861.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/july-3rd-2005-the-main/113863/c-165762\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"July 3rd, 2005 - The main...\" src=\"/images/square/113863.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/july-3rd-2005-two-routes/113865/c-165762\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"July 3rd, 2005 - Two routes...\" src=\"/images/square/113865.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/july-3rd-2005-the-roofs/113866/c-165762\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"July 3rd, 2005 - The roofs...\" src=\"/images/square/113866.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/article&gt;date:difficulty:'),(157,165818,'/the-gate-buttress-five-fingers-area/165818','/little-cottonwood-canyon/154313','The Gate Buttress - Five Fingers Area','Trad Climbing, Sport Climbing','','','5800','',3959,40.5717,-111.755,'Utah, United States, North America','','',154313,'Little Cottonwood Canyon','','','','Spring, Summer, Fall','','Mountain-Rock','content: &lt;article&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_1\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2 id=\"first_h2\"&gt;Approach&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;font color=\"orange\"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Photos Coming Soon!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt;  &lt;p&gt;  Park at the large pullout on the left side of the road 1.25 miles up the canyon. This parking area is used for approaching any of the 94 routes found in The Gate Buttress area.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;  Five Fingers has three separate approaches, and all are a bit of a pain - it takes longer to get to the climbs here than you think. I will describe the approaches in order of my biased sense of speed. In general, expect about 15-20 minutes to reach the base of any climb in the Five Fingers area.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;  &lt;b&gt;School Room Approach:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Hike up the trail heading west (left) from the pullout. This will take you through a shady grove with some large boulders collectively known as the Gate Boulders, which are popular for bouldering. Keep to the left, and soon the trail leaves the trees and becomes harder to find as you enter a large talus slope. Pick your way up the slope, heading to the large granite wall on your right. This is School Room.   &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;  At School Room, follow the base of the cliffs until you reach a mottled slab. The slab is exposed, and a belay may be desire, but you can (carefully) walk across it in climbing shoes to reach the Five Fingers area.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;  &lt;b&gt;Prune Face Approach:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;At the Gate Boulders take the trail that heads into the boulders area. Eventually this trail forks - take the left fork. Soon a feinter trail heading up a wash is reached. Head up this trail (right), and turn left once you reach some cliffs. You\'ll walk beneath the Prune Face slab and a chimney. Continue another 50 ft to some easier (but exposed) 3rd class slabs. Climb these until you reach a roof. At this point, traverse to the right and drop into a gulley on the right. Climb the gulley to reach Five Fingers.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;  &lt;b&gt;Middle Approach:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Same as School Room approach, but less risky. As you head up the talus slope, once the trees to your right end, traverse right and descend a clearing on the other side of the trees. Walk left to reach a mottled slab. This slab isn\'t as steep as the one on the first approach, and it has a nice seam/ledge to walk on. Cross the slab taking the higher seam. On the other side, climb alongside a gulley until you reach a roof, and descend into the gulley on your right. Scramble up this to reach Five Fingers.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;  Once at the Five Fingers area, there is an exposed class 3 ledge system right across from the mottled slab. Take this ledge system to reach routes on the left (west) side of Five Fingers. This ledge system can also be gained by climbing a brushy chute right before the mottled slab, and descending the backside of a large flake.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;  For Bombay Chimney and the routes on the right (SE) side of the area, follow the gulley up to the granite wall. This is the base of the Five Fingers route. Traverse left over some spires and a class 3 ledge system beneath the routes. At Bombay Chimney there is a large shady pine tree located on a flat ledge that makes a good anchor. All the ledges here are relatively tight and exposed.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;  &lt;b&gt;Descent:&lt;/b&gt; There aren\'t any bolt anchors here, and I didn\'t really see any runners left behing, so be prepared to make your own rap anchor on the small trees above. As a fast way to leave the climbing area, if you\'re near Bombay Chimney, rap off the large pine tree. You can drop straight down and cut right across the mottled slab on one rappel, saving yourself the time and trouble of downclimbing the exposed and brushy 3rd class rock.&lt;br&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_2\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Route Description&lt;/h2&gt;The Five Fingers Area is a section of the Gate Buttress where the wall grows shorter and steeper. It is bisected by many more cracks and chimneys, and the rock here is somewhat rotten. Where the cliff changes from east to south-facing there are a series of prominent vertical cracks that appear to be fingers stretching up the cliff face form which the climbing area draws its name.  &lt;p&gt;  An exposed and slightly brushy scramble is needed to reach the base of any of these climbs, but the trees and steeper walls keep most of the area better shaded than most of the rest of Gate Buttress, and the harder approach gives the climber more solitude here than in the other areas of Gate Buttress. Gate Buttress is noticeably different from the other areas because of the large number of easy to moderate route grades that ascend chimneys, giving the climber a chance to practice offwidths and stemming.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;table border=\"1\" cellspacing=\"0\"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;  &lt;table border=\"0\" cellspacing=\"2\" cellpadding=\"2\"&gt;    &lt;tr bgcolor=\"#c0c0c0\"&gt;&lt;td colspan=\"5\"&gt;&lt;font style=\"font-weight:bold;\"&gt;ROUTES OVERVIEW&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;  &lt;tr&gt;  &lt;td align=\"center\"&gt;&lt;font style=\"font-weight:bold;\"&gt;Route&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/td&gt;  &lt;td align=\"center\"&gt;&lt;font style=\"font-weight:bold;\"&gt;Difficulty&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/td&gt;  &lt;td align=\"center\"&gt;&lt;font style=\"font-weight:bold;\"&gt;Rating&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/td&gt;  &lt;td align=\"center\"&gt;&lt;font style=\"font-weight:bold;\"&gt;FA&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/td&gt;  &lt;td align=\"center\"&gt;&lt;font style=\"font-weight:bold;\"&gt;Trad/Sport&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/td&gt;    &lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;  &lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"#Chicken+Chickenhead+-+5.6\"&gt;Chicken Chickenhead&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;  &lt;td align=\"center\"&gt;5.6&lt;/td&gt;  &lt;td align=\"center\"&gt;&lt;/td&gt;  &lt;td&gt;Larry Evans &amp;amp; Rich Reams&lt;/td&gt;  &lt;td align=\"center\"&gt;Tr&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;    &lt;tr&gt;  &lt;td bgcolor=\"#e0e0e0\"&gt;The Waltz&lt;/td&gt;  &lt;td bgcolor=\"#e0e0e0\" align=\"center\"&gt;5.6&lt;/td&gt;  &lt;td bgcolor=\"#e0e0e0\" align=\"center\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"http://www.summitpost.org/images/stara.gif\"&gt;&lt;/td&gt;  &lt;td bgcolor=\"#e0e0e0\"&gt;Unknown&lt;/td&gt;  &lt;td bgcolor=\"#e0e0e0\" align=\"center\"&gt;Tr&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;    &lt;tr&gt;  &lt;td&gt;Tenderloin&lt;/td&gt;  &lt;td align=\"center\"&gt;5.5&lt;/td&gt;  &lt;td align=\"center\"&gt;&lt;/td&gt;  &lt;td&gt;Unknown&lt;/td&gt;  &lt;td align=\"center\"&gt;Tr&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;    &lt;tr&gt;  &lt;td bgcolor=\"#e0e0e0\"&gt;High Five&lt;/td&gt;  &lt;td bgcolor=\"#e0e0e0\" align=\"center\"&gt;5.11d&lt;/td&gt;  &lt;td bgcolor=\"#e0e0e0\" align=\"center\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"http://www.summitpost.org/images/stara.gif\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"http://www.summitpost.org/images/stara.gif\"&gt;&lt;/td&gt;  &lt;td bgcolor=\"#e0e0e0\"&gt;1990, Stuart &amp;amp; Bret Ruckman&lt;/td&gt;  &lt;td bgcolor=\"#e0e0e0\" align=\"center\"&gt;Sp&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;    &lt;tr&gt;  &lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"#Fat+Man\'s+Misery+-+5.5\"&gt;Fat Man\'s Misery&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;  &lt;td align=\"center\"&gt;5.5&lt;/td&gt;  &lt;td align=\"center\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"http://www.summitpost.org/images/stara.gif\"&gt;&lt;/td&gt;  &lt;td&gt;Unknown&lt;/td&gt;  &lt;td align=\"center\"&gt;Tr&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;    &lt;tr&gt;  &lt;td bgcolor=\"#e0e0e0\"&gt;Scumbag Crack&lt;/td&gt;  &lt;td bgcolor=\"#e0e0e0\" align=\"center\"&gt;5.6&lt;/td&gt;  &lt;td bgcolor=\"#e0e0e0\" align=\"center\"&gt;&lt;/td&gt;  &lt;td bgcolor=\"#e0e0e0\"&gt;Unknown&lt;/td&gt;  &lt;td bgcolor=\"#e0e0e0\" align=\"center\"&gt;Tr&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;    &lt;tr&gt;  &lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"#Five+Fingers+-+5.6/5.7\"&gt;Five Fingers&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;  &lt;td align=\"center\"&gt;5.6/5.7&lt;/td&gt;  &lt;td align=\"center\"&gt;&lt;/td&gt;  &lt;td&gt;1960, Bob Bruschke, Wilf Bruschke, &amp;amp; Ted Wilson&lt;/td&gt;  &lt;td align=\"center\"&gt;Tr&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;    &lt;tr&gt;  &lt;td bgcolor=\"#e0e0e0\"&gt;Bitterfingers&lt;/td&gt;  &lt;td bgcolor=\"#e0e0e0\" align=\"center\"&gt;5.11d&lt;/td&gt;  &lt;td bgcolor=\"#e0e0e0\" align=\"center\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"http://www.summitpost.org/images/stara.gif\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"http://www.summitpost.org/images/stara.gif\"&gt;&lt;/td&gt;  &lt;td bgcolor=\"#e0e0e0\"&gt;1981, Merrill Bitter&lt;/td&gt;  &lt;td bgcolor=\"#e0e0e0\" align=\"center\"&gt;Sp&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;    &lt;tr&gt;  &lt;td&gt;Bitterfingers Direct&lt;/td&gt;  &lt;td align=\"center\"&gt;5.11d&lt;/td&gt;  &lt;td align=\"center\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"http://www.summitpost.org/images/stara.gif\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"http://www.summitpost.org/images/stara.gif\"&gt;&lt;/td&gt;  &lt;td&gt;1988, Gordon Douglass &amp;amp; Stuart Ruckman&lt;/td&gt;  &lt;td align=\"center\"&gt;Sp&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;    &lt;tr&gt;  &lt;td bgcolor=\"#e0e0e0\"&gt;Hornet\'s Rest&lt;/td&gt;  &lt;td bgcolor=\"#e0e0e0\" align=\"center\"&gt;5.8+&lt;/td&gt;  &lt;td bgcolor=\"#e0e0e0\" align=\"center\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"http://www.summitpost.org/images/stara.gif\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"http://www.summitpost.org/images/stara.gif\"&gt;&lt;/td&gt;  &lt;td bgcolor=\"#e0e0e0\"&gt;Ted Wilson, Bob Bruschke, &amp;amp; Wilf Bruschke&lt;/td&gt;  &lt;td bgcolor=\"#e0e0e0\" align=\"center\"&gt;Tr&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;  &lt;tr&gt;&lt;td colspan=\"5\"&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;i&gt;Route overview information used from Stuart &amp;amp; Bret Ruckman\'s &lt;a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0762727306/summitpost-20/103-3515982-7251006\"&gt;Rock Climbing the Wasatch Range&lt;/a&gt;.

The route starts out a little brushy, but the rock is really quite good. Fun chimney climbing mixed with crack climbing, with many different types of trad placements needed. This chimney stays pretty well shaded throughout the day, making it a nice climb.  &lt;p&gt;  Its nice to girth hitch the belayer to the tree for the lead climb. Be careful if the belayer sits away from the tree as bits of gravel can be knocked down, but the frist headwall sends most of it overhead.  When a climber is top-roping, it is reccommended to set a gear anchor and belay from the far side of Bombay Chimney to reduce rope drag.&lt;br&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_5\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Five Fingers - 5.6/5.7&lt;/h2&gt;Technically I haven\'t completed any of the routes variations on this part of the wall, but I figured since I\'ve climbed on them (and downclimbed!), I can give a first-hand account of what they\'re like.  &lt;p&gt;  Basically, there are a bunch of deep off-width cracks and squeeze chimneys with a lot of variations on very steep rock. As such, no specific line is described and the rating varies depending on where you go.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;  This area has the potential to be fun in that the strange rock requires some very awkard and difficult moves and will test your creativity for climbing, pro placement, and route selection.  The downside to this climbing area is the rotten rock. Perhaps because this area hasn\'t been climbed much, there are many flakes that you can rip off with your hands, and climbing sends down a constant stream of grit that is scraped off the granite.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;  Its because of the loose rock that I retreated leading midway up, but I\'m eager to climb it more securely on top rope.&lt;br&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_6\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Essential Gear&lt;/h2&gt;Most of the routes here are trad routes. Based on the nature of the cracks, a variety of nuts, hexes, and cams from large to small sizes are needed. There are no chains above this area, and it seems like it is rarely climbed, so don\'t count on an anchor being left for you! Bring some webbing and rap rings for setting up a top rope/rap anchor on the trees at the top of the routes.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_7\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Other Info&lt;/h2&gt;If you have additional info for routes described or have done a route not described in depth, please put the info here and I\'ll integrate it into the page!&lt;br&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_8\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Images&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div align=\"center\"&gt;&lt;table id=\"my_images\"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/dragonfly-bouldering/236449/c-165818\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Dragonfly Bouldering\" src=\"/images/square/236449.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/first-pitch-school-room/461770/c-165818\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"First pitch (School Room)\" src=\"/images/square/461770.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/3rd-pitch-school-room/461772/c-165818\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"3rd pitch (School Room)\" src=\"/images/square/461772.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/top-of-the-second-pitch/461760/c-165818\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Top of the second pitch\" src=\"/images/square/461760.JPG\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/third-pitch-school-room-west/461761/c-165818\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Third pitch (School Room West)\" src=\"/images/square/461761.JPG\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/the-school-room/461762/c-165818\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"The School Room\" src=\"/images/square/461762.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/4th-pitch-school-room/461774/c-165818\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"4th pitch (School Room)\" src=\"/images/square/461774.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/school-room-west/461757/c-165818\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"School Room (West)\" src=\"/images/square/461757.JPG\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/school-room-west/461758/c-165818\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"School Room (West)\" src=\"/images/square/461758.JPG\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/little-cottonwood-canyon/461776/c-165818\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Little Cottonwood Canyon\" src=\"/images/square/461776.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/article&gt;date:difficulty:'),(158,165854,'/the-gate-buttress-prune-face/165854','/little-cottonwood-canyon/154313','The Gate Buttress - Prune Face','Sport Climbing, Toprope','','','5800','',3369,40.5717,-111.755,'Utah, United States, North America','','',154313,'Little Cottonwood Canyon','','','','Spring, Summer, Fall','','Mountain-Rock','content: &lt;article&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_1\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2 id=\"first_h2\"&gt;Approach&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;font color=\"orange\"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Photos Coming Soon!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt;  &lt;p&gt;  Park at the large pullout on the left side of the road 1.25 miles up the canyon. This parking area is used for approaching any of the 94 routes found in The Gate Buttress area.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;  Hike up the trail heading west (left) from the pullout. This will take you through a shady grove with some large boulders collectively known as the Gate Boulders, which are popular for bouldering. Hike through these, and take the feint trail that heads left. At an obvious junction, go left, and then leave the trail for a more feint trail that heads up a wash (right). This soon dead-ends into some cliffs and Prune Face is on your left.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;  &lt;b&gt;Descent:&lt;/b&gt; There are two ways to reach and descend from the anchors if you\'re not lead climbing or lowering.   &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;  The first is to climb about 50 ft left of Prune Face and scramble up a groove in some cl.3-4 slabs with exposure. Continue up the slabs until you reach a large roof. Climb under this as you are detoured to the right and into a gulley. At this point you are a little bit above the anchors. Downclimb about 50 ft on the rock on the opposite side of the gulley.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;  The second is to follow the trail at the base of Prune Face left until you reach a clearing. Stay on the edge of the clearing and look for a trail (may be on top of some boulders) that cuts back right and into the trees.  Take this trail and cut into a clearing on the right as soon as possibe. From here, walk across an exposed but easy slab with some good foot ledges to reach the roof described in the first approach. This route is probably the safer one for downclimbing.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;  The last 5 feet to the ledge below the anchor requries some 5.3-5.4 friction climbing and a fall would be very bad. This can be belayed from the trees above.&lt;br&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_2\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Route Description&lt;/h2&gt;Two aspects that summarize this area are: Shade and Quick Access. Prune Face is a long, narrow, wrinkled slab that is closer to the pullout for Gate Buttress than any of the other climbs. The approach is probably about 3-5 minutes. The base is well-shaded, a rarity for routes in the Gate Buttress area. As such, this wall is great for climbing on hot summer afternoons.  &lt;p&gt;  The climbing is very hard (much harder than similar ratings that I\'ve climbed elsewhere in the canyon) and is continuously difficult for the entire length of the slab. There are many loose flakes (pinky-nail-size or smaller) that can tear off, and they tend to get grit on your climbing shoes, so watch out! Also, if leading, the climbing is very runout.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;  After climbing some of the routes, I can\'t reasonably agree with some of the info in Stuart &amp;amp; Bret Ruckman\'s \"Rock Climbing the Wasatch Range\". As such, I\'m deliberately deviating from the text here by adjusting the grades (5.9+ for Straight on for You).  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;table border=\"1\" cellspacing=\"0\"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;  &lt;table border=\"0\" cellspacing=\"2\" cellpadding=\"2\"&gt;    &lt;tr bgcolor=\"#c0c0c0\"&gt;&lt;td colspan=\"5\"&gt;&lt;font style=\"font-weight:bold;\"&gt;ROUTES OVERVIEW&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;  &lt;tr&gt;  &lt;td align=\"center\"&gt;&lt;font style=\"font-weight:bold;\"&gt;Route&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/td&gt;  &lt;td align=\"center\"&gt;&lt;font style=\"font-weight:bold;\"&gt;Difficulty&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/td&gt;  &lt;td align=\"center\"&gt;&lt;font style=\"font-weight:bold;\"&gt;Rating&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/td&gt;  &lt;td align=\"center\"&gt;&lt;font style=\"font-weight:bold;\"&gt;FA&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/td&gt;  &lt;td align=\"center\"&gt;&lt;font style=\"font-weight:bold;\"&gt;Trad/Sport&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/td&gt;    &lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;  &lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"#Shuffleboard+-+5.8\"&gt;Shuffleboard&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;  &lt;td align=\"center\"&gt;5.8&lt;/td&gt;  &lt;td align=\"center\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"http://www.summitpost.org/images/stara.gif\"&gt;&lt;/td&gt;  &lt;td&gt;Unknown&lt;/td&gt;  &lt;td align=\"center\"&gt;Tr&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;    &lt;tr&gt;  &lt;td bgcolor=\"#e0e0e0\"&gt;Iron Grit Variation&lt;/td&gt;  &lt;td bgcolor=\"#e0e0e0\" align=\"center\"&gt;5.?&lt;/td&gt;  &lt;td bgcolor=\"#e0e0e0\" align=\"center\"&gt;&lt;/td&gt;  &lt;td bgcolor=\"#e0e0e0\"&gt;1994, Layne Oliver and Fred Durtschi&lt;/td&gt;  &lt;td bgcolor=\"#e0e0e0\" align=\"center\"&gt;Sp/Tr&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;    &lt;tr&gt;  &lt;td&gt;Irong Grit&lt;/td&gt;  &lt;td align=\"center\"&gt;5.11a&lt;/td&gt;  &lt;td align=\"center\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"http://www.summitpost.org/images/stara.gif\"&gt;&lt;/td&gt;  &lt;td&gt;1995, Tony Calderone, Fred Durtschi, and Layne Oliver&lt;/td&gt;  &lt;td align=\"center\"&gt;Sp/Tr&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;    &lt;tr&gt;  &lt;td bgcolor=\"#e0e0e0\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"#Prune+Face+-+5.9\"&gt;Prune Face&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;  &lt;td bgcolor=\"#e0e0e0\" align=\"center\"&gt;5.9&lt;/td&gt;  &lt;td bgcolor=\"#e0e0e0\" align=\"center\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"http://www.summitpost.org/images/stara.gif\"&gt;&lt;/td&gt;  &lt;td bgcolor=\"#e0e0e0\"&gt;1980s, Drew Bedford and Conrad Anker&lt;/td&gt;  &lt;td bgcolor=\"#e0e0e0\" align=\"center\"&gt;Sp/Tr&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;    &lt;tr&gt;  &lt;td&gt;Straight on for You&lt;/td&gt;  &lt;td align=\"center\"&gt;5.9+&lt;/td&gt;  &lt;td align=\"center\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"http://www.summitpost.org/images/stara.gif\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"http://www.summitpost.org/images/stara.gif\"&gt;&lt;/td&gt;  &lt;td&gt;1995, Tony Calderone and Dan Giovale&lt;/td&gt;  &lt;td align=\"center\"&gt;Sp&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;    &lt;tr&gt;&lt;td colspan=\"5\"&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;i&gt;Route overview information used from Stuart &amp;amp; Bret Ruckman\'s &lt;a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0762727306/summitpost-20/103-3515982-7251006\"&gt;Rock Climbing the Wasatch Range&lt;/a&gt;.

From here, walk up the gulley about 15 ft to reach a crack that arcs out of the gulley about 15-20 ft high and returns 50ft up the gulley. There is virtually no option for protecting this crack, and I doubt protection would help as you would be likely to deck in the gulley before the rope finishes stretching.  &lt;p&gt;  The crack is what makes this route, as you have to do some interesting laybacking on your fingertips while friction-climbing with your shoes to climb up and then sideways.&lt;br&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_4\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Prune Face - 5.9&lt;/h2&gt;This route had me sweating bullets the entire way up. The climbing up to the first bolt is definitely the hardest, with some pumpy upper-body moves required on thin crimps. The granite is polished here and its difficult to get purchase with your feet. As far as I can tell from the route topo, it is cheating to use the trees at the bottom, and the route stays on the left side of the corner.  &lt;p&gt;  Above the first bolt, breath a sigh of relief as the climbing gets slgihtly easier. From this point on you\'re climbing on nubbins and flakes that hold by shoving the fat of your finger on them hard. They stick remarkably well to shoes, although they can break off and leave grit on the shoes as well. After the first three bolts,  traverse to easier ground on the left via a series of pencil-width mantels and finish the climb in a series of flaring cracks and grooves.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;  Originally this route was led with only one bolt and one pin for fixed protection, but a later party bolted the start.&lt;br&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_5\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Essential Gear&lt;/h2&gt;The gear needed will be discussed on the route description.

Shasta\'s south side. It forms the spine of Mt. Shasta\'s south side, framed by Avalanche Gulch on the east, and Cascade Gulch on the west. It is one of the mountain\'s most prominent features, &amp;amp; is visible for great distances. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Seasoned Mt. Shasta climbers frequently rate Casaval Ridge as one of the most enjoyable routes on the mountain. The route has several caveats: it is aesthetically pleasing, being the mountain\'s direct &amp;amp; continuous southwest ridge; while not overly technical, it traverses steep slopes, has a few sections of steep snow climbing, and a few portions with appreciable exposure; it is one of the most obvious winter routes, as there is only one section with avalanche potential (under uncertain snow conditions, however, it is always a good idea to err on the side of caution &amp;amp; treat all slopes as suspect until they have been confirmed otherwise); &amp;amp; the views are tremendous, &amp;amp; only get better the higher one goes- from the surrounding lowlands (Strawberry Valley, Mt. Shasta City, nearby Black Butte) to the Klamaths (Mt. Eddy is prominent, &amp;amp; the seemingly tiny Castle Crags are obvious), to Lassen Peak, the anchor of the southern Cascades, to awesome views of surrounding Avalanche &amp;amp; Cascade Gulches.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_2\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Climbing Considerations&lt;/h2&gt;While Casaval Ridge is an excellent climb, several factors should be considered before embarking on this journey. Some things to ponder: &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;* The route\'s rise is over 7,000 ft(!), as Bunny Flat is around 6,900\' &amp;amp; the summit is over 14,000\'. As many would-be summiters arrive from sea-level, acclimatization is a great idea if you want to not get terrible altitude sickness, let alone summit. Consider camping out at Horse Camp (where the Sierra Club hut is) the night before, a hike in of a few hours from Bunny Flat. 8,000 ft.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;* While Casaval Ridge is &lt;i&gt;relatively&lt;/i&gt; free from avalanche danger (there is a short section between the initial hump above Horse Camp &amp;amp; the start of the ridge proper that one should be wary of), it is always a bit of Russian Roulette under questionable conditions, especially if you want to descend another route (ascending the route is strenuous, steep, &amp;amp; exposed enough; under favorable conditions, climbers frequently descend either Avalanche Gulch or the West Face Gully). Check the Mt. Shasta avalanche forecast &lt;a href=\"http://www.shastaavalanche.org/advisories/advisories/avalanche-advisory\"&gt;here,&lt;/a&gt; &amp;amp; ideally be knowledgeable about snow conditions, avalanches, &amp;amp; how to avoid them yourself. Due to budget cutbacks, be aware that the advisory is only done Friday, Saturday, &amp;amp; Sunday from December through April (i.e. use your own judgement Monday through Thursday).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;* If you have limited experience with winter travel &amp;amp; steep snow climbing (read: correct crampon use, self belay &amp;amp; self arrest capability), you might want to wait until you\'re up to the task- the route involves traversing steep slopes, steep snow climbing, &amp;amp; exposure- some people bring along a rope &amp;amp; snow protection (of course this will slow a party down, too). People have died after slipping &amp;amp; being unable to self-arrest on the steep slopes below.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;* Casaval ridge is best done during the winter during times of stable snow conditions, &amp;amp; spring, when consolidated snow provides excellent climbing conditions. DO NOT do this one after the snow is gone unless you are crazy/stupid- don\'t say I didn\'t warn you.                    &lt;a name=\"chapter_3\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Approach&lt;/h2&gt;Start at Bunny Flat (~6,900\') and hike up to the Sierra Club Hut (~8,000\', also the standard start for Avalanche Gulch). From the hut, go north up the slope above- the start of Casaval Ridge.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;table class=\"inline_image_thumbs\"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=5277\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/5277.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=5282\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/5282.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=5283\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/5283.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=5281\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/5281.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=22565\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/22565.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_4\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Route Description&lt;/h2&gt;Casaval Ridge is a great winter or early season route. It\'s best climbed when there\'s a lot of snow pack. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Topping out above the first portion of the climb is the first crux- while easy enough, the scale of this part is misleading. It looks just a short distance to get to the rocks above, marking the conclusion of this initial section. It is actually over 1500 ft above! Trudge up this broad toe, making your way towards its crest. Once you stagger to the top of this, take a break, eat a snack, rehydrate, &amp;amp; recalibrate.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Here is a fairly flat portion, &amp;amp; some people take the opportunity to camp here (&amp;amp; acclimate). Be aware that it a) can get really f$%&amp;amp;ing windy up here (i.e. if you do camp here, it\'s a good idea to dig yourself in to protect yourself from the wind &amp;amp; also to make sure that your tent doesn\'t fly off like a flock of Canada geese when you\'re not in it), &amp;amp; b) if you camp here, you\'ll either have to descend via Casaval Ridge (which can be quite undesirable, depending on the conditions), or after descending one of the other routes, climb back up the initial portion of the ridge to retrieve your overnight gear (trust me, even if you think that is fine at the journey\'s start, you will NOT want to do this at the end of the day when all you can think of is being back at Bunny Flat &amp;amp; cracking a beer).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Above this section, there are no questions of where to go, &amp;amp; the route above is obvious - gain &amp;amp; follow the ridge.  If you\'re feeling low on huevos, this is the time to turn around. If you\'re feeling it, continue. A wide slope above this flat section leads to the ridge proper, where the real fun begins. This wide slope contains arguably the only avalanche-prone section on the route- be aware of snow conditions before committing here. Once you get to the top of this, you are now on The Ridge.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Once on the ridge proper, continue on, taking the most logical line. Most traverse the west side of the true ridge on steep snow slopes (you can often simply follow in others\' boot tracks). If you\'re feeling adventurous, you can attempt to negotiate some or all of the many rock towers on the spine of the ridge (be forewarned- it is standard Cascade volcanic rubble). &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There are 2 obvious, distinct sections where you will be forced to go directly up steep, exposed terrain- probably the technical crux(es) of the route. Each section is a few hundred ft. high, and cresting each will bring one to a welcome flattish section. The upper slope has 2 or 3 variations that go between/around different rock bands. Both sections are between 45 &amp;amp; 55 degrees (a guess here- will confirm the next time I am there).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The route tops out to the left (north) of the Red Banks, directly west of Misery Hill. The finish is truly classic- the Catwalk is a narrow walkway, directly next to a tall wall of reddish volcanic rock, that must be crossed to proceed. During high snow years, it is a walk across ample snow; in lean years it can be across mostly rock, exposed, &amp;amp; \'thought-provoking.\' &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Once across the Catwalk, the abrupt change in scenery will surprise you- the ridge itself ends abruptly &amp;amp; distinctly here.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;From here, get to (stay above the Whitney Glacier &amp;amp; don\'t fall into the bergschrund- usually obvious) &amp;amp; trudge up Misery Hill to the summit plateau. The last 100 or so ft up the summit formation can break you after a long day (especially after going all the way up from Bunny Flat after no sleep &amp;amp; coming from sea level). The summit will (might) totally make the whole ordeal worth it. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Most people descend &lt;a href=\"/mountains/route_link.pl/route_id/2/object_id/2\"&gt;Avalanche Gulch&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"http://www.summitpost.org/route/158282/west-face-gully.html\"&gt;West Face Gully&lt;/a&gt;/Cascade Gulch.&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;table class=\"inline_image_thumbs\"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=38822\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/38822.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=5278\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/5278.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=38826\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/38826.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=646\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/646.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=7418\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/7418.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_5\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Essential Gear&lt;/h2&gt;Crampons and an ice axe are essential.

McCallister\'s son married a women from Spain. \'Casa\' in spanish is \'house,\' while \'val\' means \'valley.\' The marriage location (?) and their residence was the house down in the valley- Casaval.&lt;a name=\"chapter_7\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Miscellaneous Info&lt;/h2&gt;If you have information about this route that doesn\'t pertain to any of the other sections, please add it here.&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;table class=\"inline_image_thumbs\"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=1377\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/1377.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=104985\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/104985.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=104978\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/104978.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=105009\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/105009.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=104984\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/104984.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;                                                                                                                                                                                           &lt;div align=\"center\"&gt;&lt;a name=\"messages\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_8\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Additions and Corrections&lt;/h2&gt;[ &lt;a href=\"/object_discussion.php?type=vote_comments&amp;amp;object_id=155538&amp;amp;is_addition=1#vote_form\"&gt;Post an Addition or Correction&lt;/a&gt; ]&lt;table cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" style=\"width: 775px;\"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;table cellpadding=\"2\" cellspacing=\"2\" width=\"100%\"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;&lt;span class=\"pagertext\"&gt;Viewing: &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;-&lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt; of &lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td align=\"center\"&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td align=\"right\"&gt;    &lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;table border=\"0\" width=\"775\" class=\"messages\"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td width=\"110\" align=\"left\" valign=\"top\" style=\"padding-top: 6px;\"&gt;&lt;a name=\"20835\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a class=\"dis_user_lnk\" href=\"/users/solored/17265\"&gt;SoloRed&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td valign=\"top\" style=\"padding-top: 6px;\"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Route Comment&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td align=\"right\" valign=\"top\" nowrap style=\"font-size: 10px;\"&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td valign=\"top\" rowspan=\"2\" align=\"left\" style=\"padding-top: 6px;\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=\"font-size: 9px; color: #888;\"&gt;Hasn\'t voted&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td colspan=\"2\" style=\"padding-top: 6px;\"&gt;Selters\' guide notes that some have said this route compares to classic ridges of the Alps.  I agree, but ONLY if you climb most of the gendarmes directly (skipping a few of the lower ones that are VERY difficult except from the West, e.g., if descending the ridge).  If you\'re just sticking to the snow below the ridgeline, you\'ve chopped out most of the technical challenge.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r&lt;br&gt;To continue the fun after finishing the ridge, traverse around onto the steep upper firn of the Whitney Gl., on the N side of Misery Hill, in order to get to the summit plateau.&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td valign=\"bottom\" style=\"padding-top: 6px;\" colspan=\"2\"&gt;&lt;span style=\"font-size: 9px; color: #888;\"&gt;Posted Jan 27, 2004 2:17 pm&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;table border=\"0\" width=\"775\" class=\"messages\"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td width=\"110\" align=\"left\" valign=\"top\" style=\"padding-top: 6px;\"&gt;&lt;a name=\"194612\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a class=\"dis_user_lnk\" href=\"/users/newdayrising/27741\"&gt;NewDayRising&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td valign=\"top\" style=\"padding-top: 6px;\"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Hybrid AG-CR route&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td align=\"right\" valign=\"top\" nowrap style=\"font-size: 10px;\"&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td valign=\"top\" rowspan=\"2\" align=\"left\" style=\"padding-top: 6px;\"&gt;&lt;p class=\"disc_avatar\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"/users/newdayrising/27741\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"NewDayRising\" width=\"50\" height=\"50\" border=\"0\" src=\"/images/avatars/298074.JPG\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=\"font-size: 9px; color: #888;\"&gt;Hasn\'t voted&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td colspan=\"2\" style=\"padding-top: 6px;\"&gt;An alternative route is to use Avalanche Gulch then traverse over to Casaval Ridge between the rock towers.

Set up camp at or above Sam Mack Meadow. The approach hike is about 7 miles to the end of the trail. From there traverse the Palisade Glacier to the base of the U-Notch, which is the obvious gap in the Palisade Crest.&lt;a name=\"chapter_2\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Route Description&lt;/h2&gt;Climb the U-Notch Couloir (snow in spring and early summer, becoming progressively icier as the season progresses). If the bergschrund is open, climb the easy class 5 rock to the right of it. Ascend the gully (40 degree snow/ice) till you come to some rocks and go to the left of those. You are soon at the notch. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;On the right (west) side of the notch there is a steep wall with a crack/chimney system. Opinions differ on the difficulty of this section. Estimates range from Class 4 (old school) to 5.6 (grade inflation?). One thing is for sure, it will feel harder in mountaineering boots, and even harder if wet. Plan accordingly.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Traverse the ridge above the crack/chimney system, staying below the crest on the south side. Drop into a bowl and then climb the opposite side up large boulders till you reach the summit. The last few moves are exposed, but the entire traverse from the top of the chimney is class 3/4. Snow can complicate the traverse. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A large cornice often forms at the top of the gully that feeds into the U-notch from the left about halfway up. If present, it is a good idea to be off the route before the sun has a chance to warm it up. It has been known to collapse.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There is an easier alternative to the crack/chimney system above the notch. Descend the couloir on the south side from the notch about 100\' until it is possible to traverse climber\'s left (west) around a rib on ledges. This will lead to a gully and Class 3/4 scrambling up to the ridge, where it rejoins the normal route.&lt;br&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_3\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Essential Gear&lt;/h2&gt;The climb is often soloed by experienced climbers. If you\'re not comfortable with that, a 50m rope is plenty for the ascent, but you\'ll want at least a 6om single to rap the route. Doubles or a 70m would enable you to avoid downclimbing. A few nuts and/or cams plus slings will suffice for the rock portion. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Crampons and ice axe are minimum equipment for the couloir under most conditions and for most climbers. If there is significant ice, a second tool or two technical tools would come in handy. The couloir can be protected with rock anchors, but bringing a few ice screws would give you more options. In the spring time don\'t forget your skis for the descent.                                                                &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A helmet is a good idea in the U-Notch.

Drive to South Lake (about 21 miles from Bishop) and park at the Bishop Pass trailhead. Take the Bishop Pass trail along the left shore of South Lake, past a series of beautiful lakes and to the top of Bishop Pass. At this point, leave the trail and traverse to your left (southeast) cross country past the large, unnamed lake at 12,000 feet, under Mount Agassiz and Mount Winchell to the obvious notch below Thunderbolt Peak, Thunderbolt Pass (12,400 feet). This is the quickest way to get into Palisades Basin from the Bishop Pass Trail, although the traverse can be slow and tedious as you will need to maneuver over and around car-sized boulders as you approach Thunderbolt Pass. \"&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_2\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Route Description&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;br&gt;(From Paul Ritchins, &lt;a href=\"http://pweb.jps.net/~prichins/ca14000.htm\"&gt;Paul Ritchin\'s Fourteener Page&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;br&gt;From Thunderbolt Pass, drop down to near 12,000 feet to running water and grassy benches for a superb camp site. This, seldom visited, site makes an ideal base camp to climb Thunderbolt, North Palisade and Mount Sill.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The climb of Thunderbolt Peak from this camp site is straightforward. Climb back up to Thunderbolt Pass and ascend the Southwest Chute #1. This is the chute immediately to the right (southwest) of Thunderbolt Pass. Part way up a chockstone blocks your progress. Take a Class 3 ledge on the right that bypasses the obstacle. At the top of the Southwest Chute, Thunderbolt Peak is directly to your right. Climb up a short, half-pitch (easy Class 5) to the summit block. Exposed Class 5.9 climbing is required for the top 30 feet or lasso the summit and jumar up to the summit register. Alternatively, from the top to the southwest chute, traverse east and south on exposed Class 3 ledges, on the backside of the peak, to the crest of the ridge southeast of Thunderbolt. Climb back to the Class 5.9 summit block a short distance away. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Correction by RW: Once at the notch, the half pitch of rock rising directly to the right is class 4, not class 5. The summit block is at most 15 feet, not 30. There is an outstanding view of the Palisade Glacier and surrounding peaks from the notch separating the North and South summits of Thunderbolt.&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;table class=\"inline_image_thumbs\"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=1793\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/1793.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_3\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Essential Gear&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;br&gt;A set of stoppers and hexes may be useful.

Follow the &lt;a href=\"http://www.summitpost.com/mountains/route_link.pl/route_id/183/object_id/108\"&gt;Glacier Canyon Route&lt;/a&gt; to \"upper Dana Meadows\" and then continue southeast up the valley to Dana Lake from where you will be able to see the couloir. Cross and head up the Dana Glacier to enter the Couloir proper.&lt;p&gt;An alternate route, if you just want to ski down, is to hike up the West Slope from the YNP Tioga Pass Entrance Station and enter the couloir from the southeast ridge. However, it is advisable to climb the couloir so you can check the snow conditions.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;table class=\"inline_image_thumbs\"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=1376\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/1376.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=7330\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/7330.JPG\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=8973\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/8973.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=72008\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/72008.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_3\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Route Description&lt;/h2&gt;The 1,200 foot Dana Couloir is a straight-forward snow / ice climb that approaches 40 degrees and tops out at 12,400 feet.  To reach the summit make a short hike (no trail) once you attain the southeast ridge.  Late in the season, the bergscrund forms at the lower end of the couloir between the two rock formations making the ascent more difficult (this was manageable w/o pro on June 24, 2001). When conditions warrant protection, this route can be done in \"four pitches from the bergschrund to the notch\" (Ref: &lt;a href=\"http://www.summitpost.com/mountains/user_link.pl?user_id=609\"&gt;forjan&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;p&gt;It is also possible to do a rock scramble (class 3) to the north of the couloir, however, the rock here is extremely loose.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;table class=\"inline_image_thumbs\"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=7039\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/7039.JPG\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=8981\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/8981.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=879\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/879.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=7038\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/7038.JPG\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=7329\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/7329.JPG\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_4\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Essential Gear&lt;/h2&gt;This route gets progressively icier through the year. During the spring and early summer, a mountaineering ice axe and crampons are all that is generally required or advisable.  A second ice axe or tool is desirable when the route is icy (e.g. June 24, 2001). By late fall, the route typically becomes a true ice climb making ice tools and protection using ice screws desirable.&lt;br&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_5\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Ski Information&lt;/h2&gt;The best time to ski is between April and early June after CA SR-120 has been plowed to Tioga Pass.  Skiing earlier in the season is possible however you will need to ski in.  The &lt;a href=\"http://www.tiogapassresort.com/\"&gt;Tioga Pass Resort&lt;/a&gt; is a cozy place to stay if you want to do this.  Many people ski the Ellery Bowl (also Double Black Diamond) off of Dana Plateau in the same trip.&lt;br&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_6\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Miscellaneous Info&lt;/h2&gt;If you have information about this route that doesn\'t pertain to any of the other sections, please add it here.&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;table class=\"inline_image_thumbs\"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=1813\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/1813.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=72009\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/72009.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=8980\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/8980.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=8974\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/8974.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=8975\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/8975.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;                                          &lt;a name=\"chapter_7\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Images&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div align=\"center\"&gt;&lt;table id=\"my_images\"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/penelope-at-the-top-of-the/71579/c-155574\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Penelope at the top of the...\" src=\"/images/square/71579.JPG\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/dana-couloir/269625/c-155574\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Dana Couloir\" src=\"/images/square/269625.JPG\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/viva-espana/326218/c-155574\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Viva Espana!\" src=\"/images/square/326218.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/penelope-may-about-a-pitch/71575/c-155574\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Penelope May about a pitch...\" src=\"/images/square/71575.JPG\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/dana-peak-coulior-and/7330/c-155574\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Dana Peak, Coulior, and...\" src=\"/images/square/7330.JPG\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/good-view-of-dana-glacier-and/71581/c-155574\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Good view of Dana Glacier and...\" src=\"/images/square/71581.JPG\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/miguel-tackles-the-berschund/326211/c-155574\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Miguel Tackles The Berschund\" src=\"/images/square/326211.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/two-teams/326474/c-155574\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Two Teams\" src=\"/images/square/326474.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/excellent-conditions-in-the/71577/c-155574\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Excellent conditions in the...\" src=\"/images/square/71577.JPG\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/dana-couloir/239600/c-155574\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Dana Couloir\" src=\"/images/square/239600.JPG\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/topping-out-dry/326044/c-155574\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Topping out dry\" src=\"/images/square/326044.JPG\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/mount-dana-dana-couloir/286915/c-155574\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Mount Dana -- Dana Couloir\" src=\"/images/square/286915.JPG\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/26-september-2004-french/72009/c-155574\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"26-September-2004: French...\" src=\"/images/square/72009.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/taking-a-break/899762/c-155574\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"taking a break\" src=\"/images/square/899762.JPG\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td colspan=\"7\" align=\"center\"&gt;[ &lt;a href=\"/dana-couloir/images/p-155574\"&gt;View Gallery - 53 More Images&lt;/a&gt; ]&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/article&gt;date:'),(165,155670,'/disappointment-cleaver/155670','/mount-rainier/150291','Disappointment Cleaver','','','Class 2-3','','',126312,46.8528,-121.759,'Washington, United States, North America','','',150291,'Mount Rainier','','0.8923076923076924','Snow/Glacier, non-technical','','A few days','Route','content: &lt;article&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_1\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2 id=\"first_h2\"&gt;Approach&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;br&gt;You\'ve decided to climb Mt. Rainier, but you want to take the easiest route. You\'ve come to the right place. This is a &lt;i&gt;very&lt;/i&gt; popular route. If you plan to climb on the weekend, it is recommended that you get permits ahead of time.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Your first day is a climb from Paradise (5500ft) to Camp Muir (10000ft) along the Muir Snowfield. This route is quite popular just as a dayhike, and during the summer months the trail is fairly crowded. In nice weather route-finding is easy and you simply follow the beaten path that starts at the large parking lot at Paradise. In less-than-nice weather, the route-finding on the Muir Snowfield can be trickier. You don\'t want to get too far off the correct path, or you might find yourself in a crevasse on the SE side. A surprising number of hikers have died on this \"easy\" section of the route. You can get a set of compass headings or GPS coords from the ranger station in Paradise. They are posted outside so you can get them any time of day.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Go early, and you can assure yourself a spot at the Muir hut, which can obviate the need for you to carry a tent. There are several alternatives if the permit quota is full for Camp Muir. You can go higher to Ingraham Flat, camp on the Muir Snow Field, or even at the base of Gibralter Rock Route. If you go during the week, you should have no trouble getting a permit. Be sure to get your permit at the ranger station - you have to stop here to pick one up even if you have advance reservations. The ranger station is on the north side of the large parking lot (not next to the visitor center).&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;table class=\"inline_image_thumbs\"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=1450\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/1450.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=1451\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/1451.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=1448\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/1448.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=1449\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/1449.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=1447\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/1447.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_2\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Route Description&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;br&gt;Rainier Mountaineering Inc (RMI) grooms this route all season for the thousands of clients they take up Mt. Rainier each year. There are generally no technical sections, crevasses are well marked, and the steepest portion on the Disappoinment Cleaver (DC) has fixed ropes. The route is open from May to October, but late in the season significant crevasses open and the route necessarily meanders to find the easiest crossing. RMI fixes ladders late in the season to get over the nasty ones. Though most climbing is done before August because of the increased difficulties, speed ascents are often done at this time due to the lack of snow lower on the route. Chad Kellogg set the current record of just over 5hrs roundtrip from the Paradise Ranger Station during August.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Most people leave Camp Muir anywhere from between 10p and 2a, depending on their fitness level and expectations on how long it will take to climb. It is only a few miles, but another 4,500ft of vertical. Leaving Camp Muir, the route contours across the Cowlitz Glacier to Cathedral Gap. A shorter, steeper alternative is to take Cadaver Gap, but that is more difficult (and avalanche prone - Willi Unsoeld died coming down here). As you climb Cathedral Gap, shorten your rope between partners some to ease the negotiation of the switchbacks (then go back to regular spacing on the other side). &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;On the other side of Cathedral Gap, you climb onto the Ingraham Glacier and soon pass Ingraham Flat, an alternative overnight spot. The route contours around this glacier to the large rocky ridge to the north, the DC.  Later in the season large gaps may open between the glacier and the cleaver, so be careful to watch your step, particularly if it is still dark. RMI fixes ropes at the base of the cleaver for the steepest section here that climbs up and to the right. Once on the ridge,  the ropes end, and the climbing eases. Marvel at the sight of Little Tahoma Peak immediately behind you to the east. Follow the beaten path to the top of the DC where you will get a great view of the upper mountain.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;You now climb out onto the Emmons Glacier for the last, steep climb to the crater rim. The oxygen gets scarce up here, so you probably have to slow down and take your time. Let others pass you if you are going slow, be courteous when attempting to pass others. This is not a Wilderness experience with all these folks out here, so take it easy and relax. You still have a long way to go. There are usually wands marking the entire route, and it is pretty easy to follow these in good weather. In nastier weather they are lifesavers and will guide you back along the proper route. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;At the crater rim, the route goes left and enters the crater on the southeast side. The true summit is still 20 minutes away to the NW, though many parties call it quits at the crater. Go to the summit no matter how tired you are - that way you won\'t have any nagging regrets later. There are no crevasses in the crater so you can drop your ropes, packs, harnesses, and all the extra gear you carried but never used. Enjoy your moment on top of the world.&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;table class=\"inline_image_thumbs\"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=1455\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/1455.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=1453\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/1453.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=1456\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/1456.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=1454\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/1454.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=1452\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/1452.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_3\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Essential Gear&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;br&gt;There are no technical sections, but it is recommended that your party carry some of the following: &lt;br&gt;crampons/axe&lt;br&gt;rope&lt;br&gt;harnesses (waist and chest)&lt;br&gt;belay device&lt;br&gt;rescue pulleys&lt;br&gt;prussik slings&lt;br&gt;snow pickets&lt;br&gt;ice screws&lt;br&gt;slings&lt;br&gt;carabiners&lt;br&gt;wands&lt;br&gt;GPS&lt;br&gt;cell phone&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;That said, you may use almost none of this equipment on this route. But having it with you, and knowing how to use it will make your climb more enjoyable (and more responsible). Don\'t call for rescue unless its serious - the Park Service doesn\'t appreciate calls because climbers are tired or hungry or cold. &lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;table class=\"inline_image_thumbs\"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=116788\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/116788.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_4\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Miscellaneous Info&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;br&gt;If you have information about this route that doesn\'t pertain to any of the other sections, please add it here.&lt;br&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_5\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Images&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div align=\"center\"&gt;&lt;table id=\"my_images\"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/ingraham-flat/569042/c-155670\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Ingraham Flat\" src=\"/images/square/569042.JPG\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/sunrise-over-little-tahoma/687129/c-155670\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Sunrise over Little Tahoma\" src=\"/images/square/687129.JPG\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/above-13k-ft-on-the-dc-route/65796/c-155670\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Above 13k ft on the DC route...\" src=\"/images/square/65796.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/sunrise-behind-little-tahoma-peak/816830/c-155670\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Sunrise behind Little Tahoma Peak.\" src=\"/images/square/816830.JPG\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/hiking-above-the-clouds/761601/c-155670\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Hiking Above the Clouds\" src=\"/images/square/761601.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/yours-truly-on-mount-rainier/733322/c-155670\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Yours Truly on Mount Rainier\" src=\"/images/square/733322.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/little-tahoma-from-mt-rainier/434964/c-155670\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Little Tahoma from Mt.

You can find more information on &lt;a href=\"http://www.summitpost.com/mountains/route_link.pl/route_id/101/object_id/262\"&gt;getting to the U-Notch&lt;/a&gt; on the North Palisade page.&lt;br&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_2\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Route Description&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;br&gt;From the top of the U-Notch, climb up a wide crack to the right. If you need to use a rope here, you\'ll likely want one later, but if you are comfortable soloing this section, you can leave your rope behind. Secor rates it class 5.2, but I don\'t think it warrants more than a class 4 rating.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Once above this first short section of about 20 feet, it flattens out a bit, and you can traverse around to the right over large rocks and a thin ledge that skirts the base of the west face (class 2-3 here), to the base of the SW ridge.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There is another class 4 section here that goes up the easier rock on the right side of the west face, climbing up and diagonally to the right where it meets the SW ridge. Leave your rope on the ridge (if you brought it this far), and climb the ridge to the summit. There are some really large rocks to surrmount near the summit, and some interesting class 3 problems. There should be no need to climb more than easy class 4 here. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Some individuals bypass the large summit blocks by traversing around the south side to the SE Ridge, but that doesn\'t seem to offer any real advantage.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For those that choose to rap down, &lt;a href=\"http://www.summitpost.com/mountains/user_link.pl?user_id=583\"&gt;Diggler&lt;/a&gt; offers this comment: &lt;i&gt;poorly placed rap stations (length of rappel fine, but rope runs over rock, and the possibility exists of the rope getting stuck (mine almost did twice!!).&lt;/i&gt; Now that I think about it, my rope &lt;i&gt;did&lt;/i&gt; get stuck on the upper class 4 section the first time I climbed it, and I ended up soloing back to the top of the section to free it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;table class=\"inline_image_thumbs\"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=1599\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/1599.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_3\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Essential Gear&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;br&gt;Coming from the north side, you will likely need axe and crampons to climb the U-Notch (you can leave them at the top of the U-Notch). If you are comfortable climbing class 4 you can leave your rope at home. If not, bring a standard 50m rope to use for the three pitches along with some slings and a small assortment of gear. We brought only a set of odd-numbered nuts which proved more than sufficient.&lt;br&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_4\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Miscellaneous Info&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;br&gt;If you have information about this route that doesn\'t pertain to any of the other sections, please add it here.&lt;br&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_5\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Images&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div align=\"center\"&gt;&lt;table id=\"my_images\"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/partners-in-crime/326012/c-155706\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"partners in crime\" src=\"/images/square/326012.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/u-notch-route-to-polemonium/633482/c-155706\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"U-Notch Route to Polemonium\" src=\"/images/square/633482.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/climbing-polemonium-from-the/1599/c-155706\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Climbing Polemonium from the...\" src=\"/images/square/1599.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/polemonium/630948/c-155706\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Polemonium\" src=\"/images/square/630948.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/in-the-notch/630942/c-155706\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"in the notch\" src=\"/images/square/630942.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/bird-s-eye-view-of-polemonium/529476/c-155706\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Bird\\\'s eye view of Polemonium\" src=\"/images/square/529476.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/article&gt;date:'),(167,155708,'/northeast-face/155708','/middle-palisade/150514','Northeast Face','','','Class 3','','',24713,37.07,-118.469,'California, United States, North America','','',150514,'Middle Palisade','','0.8923076923076924','Scramble','','One to two days','Route','content: &lt;article&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_1\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2 id=\"first_h2\"&gt;Approach&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;br&gt;From the end of Glacier Lodge Road, take the South Fork Trail towards Brainerd Lake. Half a mile before Brainerd Lake, you\'ll pass a smaller unnamed lake, and the trail will begin a mild descent. At this point you have several options. The quickest/shortest option leaves the trail at this point, before it starts to descend. Heading south, you can climb steep slabs to the right, or a large boulder field to the left. The slabs are easier, but the top of the boulder field leads to a use trail that leads from Brainerd Lake to Finger Lake. Your second option is to simply continue on the maintained trail to Brainerd Lake, then picking up the use trail that skirts the north side of the lake heading west. The use trail is lost briefly as it crosses a boulder field, but ducks often mark the entry/exit points through the boulder field. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;At Finger Lake cross over to the west side of the creek. You cannot climb to the south end of Finger Lake along the shore, and if you are heading to Middle Palisade, there\'s no reason to go that way anyway. Head up the boulders and slabs on the right side of the lake. Climb up and to the left, contouring around the left side of the ridge. This will bring you around to the base of the Middle Palisade Glacier. Head for the morraine that splits the glacier in two, and climb this to the base of the Northeast Face.&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;table class=\"inline_image_thumbs\"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=26245\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/26245.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=1605\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/1605.JPG\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=1606\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/1606.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=26221\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/26221.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=26244\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/26244.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_2\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Route Description&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;br&gt;Secor describes some reddish brown or white rocks marking a key point, the color depending on one\'s mood. In fact the granite is marked with reddish brown and white rocks in several places, often the two mixed together. The region Secor describes is &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt; the large area just above the central glacial morraine that is well evident from below.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Secor is somewhat misleading in his description of the Northeast Face route. The key element is finding the elusive ledge that climbs diagonally up and right. It does not start at the top of the central glacial morraine but higher to the left, near the high point of the southern half of the glacier. Even in late season during a dry year, it is necessary to clamber onto the glacier for at least a short distance to reach the ledge if you do not want to climb class 4-5 rock at the glacier\'s edge. The ledge then leads up to a good class 2-3 chute that can be climbed to the summit. This is the chute secor describes as a \"wide couloir\". He further describes a traverse at the top into the next couloir, but this is unnecessary. Secor\'s chute (see pictures) is really just one branch of the main chute, and one just continues up the lower chute into main one above. This route is better described in Porcella and Burns, but is called the class 3 East Face. The chute can alternatively be reached by a class 4 chimney that is about 20ft lower than the ledge and does not require one to climb the glacier.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Secor\'s chute can be bypassed altogether if you don\'t mind a bit of loose class 3 rock. From the top of the central glacial morraine, follow the obvious reddish rocks diagonally up and over to the main chute on the right. The reddish (and white) rocks are horribly loose but not really dangerous (except to those below you!), and they are the most troublesome part - it gets easier after this. The lower part of the chute is also loose, but again not really dangerous. Climb this chute to the summit, taking the left branch about a third of the way up. You will find that the chute merges with Secor\'s chute just before it branches left and right. Porcella and Burns describe climbing this main chute as the Northeast Face, but alternately describe entering from the glacier below. The advantage of following the loose reddish rock to the main chute is that crampons and axe are unnecessary.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://www.summitpost.org/mountains/user_link.pl?user_id=13699\"&gt;Eric Lee&lt;/a&gt; adds: &lt;i&gt;Even though most of the class 3 is very solid, loose rock abounds throughout the chute. It is more of an issue on the descent and a helmet is advised for all those traveling in a party of 2 or more. Even while being careful my partner and I kicked loose numerous baseball size rocks that went flying down the chute.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;table class=\"inline_image_thumbs\"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=1607\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/1607.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=5214\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/5214.JPG\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=2765\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/2765.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=10614\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/10614.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=10615\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/10615.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_3\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Essential Gear&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;br&gt;None needed unless early in the season when axe and crampons are necessary to gain the top of the glacier.&lt;br&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_4\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Miscellaneous Info&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;br&gt;If you have information about this route that doesn\'t pertain to any of the other sections, please add it here.&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;table class=\"inline_image_thumbs\"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=26247\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/26247.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_5\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Images&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div align=\"center\"&gt;&lt;table id=\"my_images\"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/the-thumb-from-finger-lake/26245/c-155708\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"The Thumb from Finger Lake -...\" src=\"/images/square/26245.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/the-two-ne-face-chutes-on/10615/c-155708\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"The two NE Face chutes on...\" src=\"/images/square/10615.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/two-chutes-are-identified/10614/c-155708\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Two chutes are identified...\" src=\"/images/square/10614.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/the-thumb-left-and-middle/26244/c-155708\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"The Thumb (left) and Middle...\" src=\"/images/square/26244.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/big-pine-brian-descends-the/97631/c-155708\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\" Big Pine Brian descends the...\" src=\"/images/square/97631.JPG\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/the-thumb-from-the-ne-face-of/26247/c-155708\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"The Thumb from the NE face of...\" src=\"/images/square/26247.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/incredible-water-color-of/26246/c-155708\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Incredible water color of...\" src=\"/images/square/26246.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/approach-route-for-northeast/1605/c-155708\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Approach route for Northeast...\" src=\"/images/square/1605.JPG\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/wendy-going-up-the-main-chute-of-middle-pal/321471/c-155708\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\'Wendy going up the \"Main Chute\" of Middle Pal\' src=\"/images/square/321471.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/the-red-brown-band-on-ne-face/214044/c-155708\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"the red-brown band on NE face\" src=\"/images/square/214044.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/looking-down-the-ne-face/26229/c-155708\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Looking down the NE face...\" src=\"/images/square/26229.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/this-should-demonstrate-the/26228/c-155708\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"This should demonstrate the...\" src=\"/images/square/26228.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/northeast-face-route-on/1607/c-155708\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Northeast Face Route on...\" src=\"/images/square/1607.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/half-way-up-the-ne-face-of/26226/c-155708\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Half-way up the NE face of...\" src=\"/images/square/26226.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td colspan=\"7\" align=\"center\"&gt;[ &lt;a href=\"/northeast-face/images/p-155708\"&gt;View Gallery - 26 More Images&lt;/a&gt; ]&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/article&gt;date:'),(168,155724,'/south-to-north-traverse/155724','/matthes-crest/150516','South to North Traverse','','','5.6','','',9617,37.8233,-119.396,'California, United States, North America','','',150516,'Matthes Crest','','1.0','Technical Climb/Scramble','','A long day','Route','content: &lt;article&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_1\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2 id=\"first_h2\"&gt;Approach&lt;/h2&gt;From the Cathedral Lakes Trailhead, hike to Cathedral Pass. As the trail starts downward, leave the trail and follow the creek drainage to the left towards Matthes Crest. Leave the creek drainage when you can make a beeline for the south end of Matthes Crest, noted by the steep drop on the ridgeline. Hike through the forest down to the Echo Creek drainage and up the other side. Climb sandy granite ledges to the base of the climb, marked by a clump of pine trees.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;You can also reach the start from Cathedral Lakes by following the use trail up the Budd Creek drainage (used for the Southeast Buttress of Cathedral Peak), climbing over the ridge near Echo Peak #8, and down into the Echo Creek drainage. This route, suggested by Secor in  his book, is shorter but requires more elevation gain and will take longer. A better way suggested by &lt;a href=\"http://www.summitpost.com/mountains/user_link.pl?user_id=3340\"&gt;Jack Daniels&lt;/a&gt; is to skip the climb to Echo Peak #8 and instead skirt the west side of Echo Peaks. There is a broad, easy hike along the west side that takes you into the Echo drainage west of Matthes Crest. This &lt;a href=\"http://www.summitpost.org/better-approach-descent-matthes-crest/809815/c-150516\"&gt;cross-country route&lt;/a&gt; is probably the fastest/easiest way to reach Matthes Crest.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;You can also reach the start of the route from the east above Matthes Lake. Climb the scree/sand slope to the notch below the steep dropoff on the south side of the ridge. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Whichever way you go, allow adequate time for the approach - it can be done in as little as 2hrs, though may take others twice as long. Leave early on weekends to get to the approach by 8a unless you don\'t mind waiting in line.&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;table class=\"inline_image_thumbs\"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=86306\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/86306.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=1640\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/1640.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=67783\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/67783.JPG\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_2\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Route Description&lt;/h2&gt;The starting point is just above the trees. There are several routes you can take (which is nice if there\'s more than one rope at the start). The easiest follows a wide crack diagonally up and to the right towards the east. The first pitch ends where the route then switches directions and heads diagonally up and to the left, staying on the west side of the ridgeline. The third pitch is easy and very short (can be done without a rope if desired). &lt;br&gt;Alternatively, you can climb from the base starting further to the right, closer to the actual ridgeline. There is a belay point (sitting on top of granite rock) at end of the first pitch that lies just right and above the belay point for the other route. The second pitch continues to go up and right, with much face climbing, good holds, but poor protection (5.7). Again the third pitch is short and easy and can be done without a rope.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Once at the top of the ridge, put away your rope and enjoy an exhilarating class 3 traverse along the ridge. It has great exposure, a little bit of route-finding, and simply great climbing. A few easy class 4 moves along the way.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As you approach the south summit you can choose to climb it (easy class 4), or head directly to the higher north summit by dropping down on the east side of the ridge about 30 feet to keep class 3. There is a bit of airy face climbing to get to the notch between the two summits, but it has great holds on thin flakes. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;At the notch drop a short way down on the west side for the single pitch of technical climbing to the summit. There are at least three routes possible here (all three were used the day we climbed). On the right is a short but steep open book with a crack in the center. A second choice is to climb a small buttress just to the left of the first route, with good holds, but not good protection. A third route starts lower down and further to the left of the summit, climbing a combination of cracks and faces to the ridge just north of the summit. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;With a long rope, a single rappel suffices to get you back to the starting point between the two notches. A second rappel will get you safely down all the upper hazards to the easier class 2 below. Alternatively the second rappel can be dispensed with if one is careful about (and good at) downclimbing the steep class 3-4 section here.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Most parties bail after reaching the summit through the rappels described above, but the traverse can be continued north from the summit, and in this author\'s opinion is even better than the southern portion. There is a great deal more class 4, some easy class 5, and some of the most impressive knife-edge traversing found anywhere. One memorable edge dubbed \"The Wave\" is actually overhanging by some 15 feet or so from vertical, and looks like an ocean wave about to break. There are two small towers at the far north end where most progress will be stopped. A downclimb exceeding 5.6 is required, and most parties bail off the ridge at this point to the west. If doing the full traverse, return to Catherdral Lake Trailhead through the Bud Creek drainage. This is most easily done by traversing left at the end of the Echo Creek drainage, and passing over the ridge to the right of Echo Peak No. 8.&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;table class=\"inline_image_thumbs\"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=117048\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/117048.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=68674\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/68674.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=1646\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/1646.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=116967\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/116967.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=67787\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/67787.JPG\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_3\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Essential Gear&lt;/h2&gt;A 50m rope will suffice, but a 60m rope will make the rappel trivial.

First climbed in 1945 by Charles Wilts and Spencer Austin, this clean route on superb granite has earned its place among the classic rock climbs of the Sierra. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;From the Cathedral Lakes Trailhead, follow the John Muir Trail for about 1/2 mile until you come to a use trail on the right side of Budd Creek. The use trail is several hundred yards right of the creek, so don\'t turn off too early or you\'ll have to cross-country without the benefit of the nice trail (until you run into it eventually). The trail stays on the right side of the creek the whole way, and ends just east of the SE Buttress. Scramble west though the trees up to the skirt of Cathedral Peak.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The starting point is not obvious, nor is there a single \"correct\" starting point. If you start too far left you will have more climbing to do (not necessarily a bad thing), but if you start too far to the right you will find yourself on on rock considerably tougher than 5.6. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;You can also reach the start by taking the John Muir Trail to Cathedral Lakes, then heading east over Budd Creek Pass. This is a good deal longer and harder, even though you have a fine maintained trail for 3 miles.&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;table class=\"inline_image_thumbs\"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=2312\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/2312.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=17972\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/17972.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_2\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Route Description&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;br&gt;From the base, the first pitch goes up the lower granite skirt of Cathedral, along any of a half dozen crack systems. A small tree is often used as the first belay point, but there are others that can be used as well. Continue climbing up ever-steepening slopes, directly towards the summit. Enjoy the views while you are belaying - they are first rate! The third pitch brings you to a chimney (the crux) which can be climbed directly or bypassed a short ways to the left with some face climbing with good chickenheads for holds. If climbing the chimney, it is easier if the leader climb without a pack and then haul it up. It\'s a bit tight with a pack on.&lt;a href=\"http://www.summitpost.org/mountains/user_link.pl?user_id=23916\"&gt; ASteele&lt;/a&gt; adds: &lt;i&gt;The chimney can also be avoided by climbing unprotected 5.6 knobs on the face directly to its right. If you want protection, you can climb a somewhat wide and awkward 5.7 crack (protected with a #3 Camalot or larger, hexes will work too) around the corner to the right. Supertopo lists a \"5.7 Bulges\" variation with fixed pitons to the right of the crack, but it didn\'t seem like the obvious thing to do, in my eyes.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The entire route can be done in 4-10 pitches, depending on where you start, the route you take, and your skill level. It took us ten pitches the first time we climbed, five the second. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There are a number of \"bomber\" belay seats, you\'ll know it when you\'re in one. They are spaced out nicely for a 50m rope, so if you get to one consider using it to belay from, even if you have more rope left. It\'ll line you up better for the next pitch.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The last pitch is difficult to protect as it consists of large granite blocks. They have good holds and are class 3-4. There are two ways to reach the summit from the top of this route. An airy step across will land you just under the summit, or alternatively you can climb down to the start of the class 4 crack that goes 15 feet to the summit.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Most parties descend via the Mountaineers Route which goes down the west side a short ways before heading over the north ridge and down the east side. Because there are likely other parties behind you, trying to descend the SE Buttress is dangerous and considered rude. Don\'t miss the opportunity to rappel directly off the northwest side of the summit block - it\'s 40 feet or so, and much fun! [&lt;i&gt;Dec, 2001&lt;/i&gt; Note: Alas, when the bolts were cut from the summit block last summer (possibly by YOSAR), this is no longer an option. It seems likely that someone will re-establish bolts on the summit in the future - and similarly likely that someone else will cut them down...]&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;An alternative descent route is the South Face. Go directly to the saddle between &lt;a href=\"http://www.summitpost.com/mountains/mountain_link.pl/mountain_id/1064\"&gt;Eichorn Pinnacle&lt;/a&gt; and Cathedral Peak\'s summit. The easiest descent on the South Face is about 30-40 feet east of the saddle. It is mostly class 2-3 ledges that zig-zag down the face, with a few class 4 sections, notable at the top and the exit at the bottom. The whole route is only about a 100 feet. If you don\'t rope up it is faster than the Mountaineers Route to return to Bud Creek and the trailhead. If you are unsure of your skills over class 4 terrain, rope up or rappel the route (but then it will take much longer than the Mountaineers Route).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;table class=\"inline_image_thumbs\"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=1669\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/1669.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=29484\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/29484.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=57161\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/57161.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=17973\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/17973.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=2314\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/2314.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_3\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Essential Gear&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;br&gt;A full set of nuts (particularly large ones) and some cams (small to medium are best), and a whole mess of slings.

Pass the Buena Vista Trail junction and cross the Illilouette Creek by either wading or using downed trees east of the trail. The creek flows wide and not very deep where the trail crosses it. In mid June on a normal year it is only two feet at the deepest point - much better than circumventing the crossing by using the bridge downstream at Illiloutte Falls. On the other side of the creek the trail heads north through a sandy open area. In two hundred yards a trail junction is encountered - turn right and go east (toward Ottoway Lakes) for about 3 miles, passing Mt. Starr King on your left. The trail skirts some granite cliffs before crossing the Clark Fork of Illilouette Creek. Leave the trail before crossing the creek, and head east (the trail heads south then southeast, following Illilouette Creek). &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;You are now in a swampy area with a gajillion downed trees and most of the standing ones equally dead. Travel through here is very slow and very tedious. Lesser mortals have given up shortly after getting lost in this quagmire. Mt. Clark is visible from this point, but it is easy to get off-route. Once you are back in the live forest area, the peak will no longer be visible. Some parties end up on Gray Peak by accident. Have a compass and use it. Mt. Clark is ENE from the swamp, not east (that\'s how you get to Gray Peak). You can follow the Clark Fork to it\'s headwaters on Mt. Clark, but you will curse every downed tree in your path and pray for logging to return to our National Parks. Your best bet is to stay just north of the swamp on drier ground where you can travel easier through standing trees (you will still pass through some swamp). Aim for the steeper forested slope between two granite bulges that hide Mt. Clark behind them. Pass through the shallow saddle at the top where you will get your first close views of Mt. Clark. While impressive, it is still 3 miles away. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Traverse along the hillside to keep from losing elevation, and head up the wide canyon on Mt. Clark\'s west side. Having lost sight of Mt. Clark again, it is easy to get off-route a bit and end up at the far north end of the very long NW Arete. A compass is useful here to keep you on track. Climb up endless steep slopes for two miles (over 2,000 ft of vertical here). Eventually you will find yourself before the massive West Face. The NW Arete is on the skyline in front of you. Climb up to the ridge and take in the breathtaking sight of the sheer cliff on the east side. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;From Happy Isle&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Take the JMT out of Happy Isle following the Merced River up the canyon (the Mist Trail between Vernal and Nevada Falls is a nice alternative with less distance and better views than the JMT proper, but many, many steps!). Around mile 8, just past Bunnell Point and after crossing the twin bridges, the trail begins to climb on the south side of the river. Where it levels out at some granite slabs and before it begins to descend back to the river, leave the trail heading south-southeast.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Climb steeply for 1,000ft under forest canopy, avoiding the brushy area halfway up. If you aren\'t watchful you will end up in bushwhacking hell (I did, and it cost me!). A flat spot is encountered then more slopes that stay sustained until you reach the toe of the NW Ridge. A large lake with good camping can be found at the base of the cliffs here. Hike southeast into Clark Canyon if you want to climb the east side of Mt. Clark, otherwise head right around the cliffs and climb the ridge that snakes its way for a mile to the NW Arete. There are two minor highpoints along this ridge that can be avoided by contouring around the west side. Or climb them for some extra class 3-4 fun. &lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;table class=\"inline_image_thumbs\"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=1701\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/1701.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_2\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Route Description&lt;/h2&gt;Most of the NW Arete is an extremely exposed class 3 traverse. It is easy climbing, but the exposure can make it seem much more difficult. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Getting onto the arete is the hardest part. There is a wide gully on the NW side (on the right of the arete) that can be climbed a good distance before climbing up to the arete proper. There is often a snowfield in this gully even late in summer, and it is usually easier to move left onto the arete shortly after reaching the snow here (see photo below). Without significant snow in the gully, it can be climbed nearly to the summit on enjoyable rock up to easy class 5.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There are at least three places that you can use to move from the gully to the arete, all of them seem class 4 or harder. Some parties use a rope here, but there is little exposure on this short section and carrying a rope all the way to Mt. Clark is quite painful (we did, and never used it!).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Once on the arete, stay right on top for most of the way, dropping down on either side in a few places. There is one main obstacle to get around on the right side of the arete, requiring a bit of crack and face climbing along with a bit of squirming to get around a large block overhead. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There is some easy class 4 just before the summit to climb up to the highest point. This is again on the right (west) side of the arete.&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;table class=\"inline_image_thumbs\"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=1703\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/1703.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=111133\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/111133.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=1704\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/1704.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=1705\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/1705.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=1702\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/1702.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_3\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Essential Gear&lt;/h2&gt;None needed, but bring a rope for those uncomfortable with exposure or the few class 4 moves. &lt;br&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_4\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Miscellaneous Info&lt;/h2&gt;If you have information about this route that doesn\'t pertain to any of the other sections, please add it here.&lt;br&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_5\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Images&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div align=\"center\"&gt;&lt;table id=\"my_images\"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/the-impressive-west-face-the/17163/c-155740\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"The impressive West Face.

Follow the trail as best as you can using the cairns and head to the gap between North and Middle Sisters keeping Folding Rock on your right.

You may want to use crampons here depending on the condition of the glacier.  Just to the left of the Col, where the glacier runs up on the base of the mountain you will see a trail running diagonal up to the left if in summer (if snow-covered, switchback up through easy slopes to gain the ridge).  Follow that up the west side of the ridge until it flips over the the east side.  The route traverses the first gendarme on the west side and back over to the east for the second gendarme.  Traverse the last one on the west to get to the traverse on rock/scree to a ridge and the start of the Terrible Traverse to the base of Prouty Peak.  Once around that, head up through the chute (the Bowling Alley) which is a loose class 4 scramble with no snow up dinner plate rock (can be steep snow, icy snow or water ice when not melted out).  Ascend the Bowling Alley slightly right of center and exit right at the top of the chute.  From there, scramble left onto the higher of the two pinnacles to the summit.&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;table class=\"inline_image_thumbs\"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=60548\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/60548.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=60549\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/60549.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=60550\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/60550.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=142362\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/142362.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=60551\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/60551.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_3\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Essential Gear&lt;/h2&gt;Helmets are a must.  Almost continuous rockfall in the warm months.  Snow conditions call for pickets, preferably two tools, some rock pro and a few ice screws.  You\'ll want two 60 meter ropes to rap the Bowling Alley in one rap.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;dkantola recommends the following:&lt;br&gt;Two tools, crampons, pickets, screws, rock pro, and a 50+ m rope until early July, &lt;br&gt;then an ice axe, crampons, pickets, rock pro, and a 50+ m rope until mid August, &lt;br&gt;then rock pro and a 50+ m rope if you want to protect or rap the Bowling Alley until snow comes in the autumn. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;One 50 m rope is enough to rap past the fourth class section of the Bowling Alley &lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;table class=\"inline_image_thumbs\"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=112557\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/112557.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=112558\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/112558.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=112560\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/112560.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=112561\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/112561.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=112559\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/112559.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_4\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Stats&lt;/h2&gt;Total distance is just a bit over 7 miles from trailhead to summit with almost 5400 feet of elevation gain.&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;table class=\"inline_image_thumbs\"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=112563\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/112563.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=112562\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/112562.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=112565\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/112565.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=112564\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/112564.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=142393\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/142393.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_5\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Miscellaneous Info&lt;/h2&gt;If you have information about this route that doesn\'t pertain to any of the other sections, please add it here.&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;table class=\"inline_image_thumbs\"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=142365\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/142365.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=142373\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/142373.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=142394\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/142394.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=142395\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/142395.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

The approach is short, approximately 3.5 miles and 1,000 feet gain.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In the spring and early summer this is a snow climb. It has been skied. As summer wanes into fall, the snow metamorphoses into neve, and then ice. If it\'s ice you want, then September-October is the time to visit. Doug Nidever, a local guide, used to maintain a &lt;a href=\"http://www.themountainguide.com/couloir/\"&gt;web page&lt;/a&gt; on Sierra Ice conditions. It\'s off line now. Hopefully it will come back.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;From the hiker parking at Saddlebag Lake (see \"Getting There\" on the main North Peak page), take the trail that passes under the dam spillway and follow it along the western shore of Saddlebag Lake. Pass Greestone Lake, then head up canyon towards Steelhead Lake. From the vicinity of Steelhead Lake travel cross country to Cascade Lake. Gain a prominent ramp about 500 feet above Cascade Lake and follow it south to the glacier at the base of the north face. This route ascends the rightmost of three obvious couloirs. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Note: Both the left and middle couloirs are also climbed. The left couloir has been mostly melted out in recent years. The center one is made interesting by a rock band near the top that introduces an element of mixed climbing. &lt;a name=\"chapter_2\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Route Description&lt;/h2&gt;The route ascends the right-hand side of the gully above the bergschrund for 4-5 pitches, depending on where you rope up and how far apart you set up belays. Staying to the right is important, as everything that falls in the upper part of the route quickly finds its way to the left side.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The bergschrund is usually crossed on the left side, but depending on conditions, you may cross closer to the right. Just remember to get over to the right as soon as possible.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In the early season, this is a snow climb. If you are comfortable on 50-degree snow, then there may be no need to rope up. In the fall, the whole gully is usually ice, and most parties rope up. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The technical climbing ends in a notch about 600 feet below the summit. If you want to sign the register, scramble up third class rock directly above the notch to the top.&lt;a name=\"chapter_3\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Descent&lt;/h2&gt;While it\'s possible to decend the route, it\'s much easier to drop down the south side towards the Conness Lakes. Eventually you will pick up a trail, which will lead you back to the trailhead.&lt;a name=\"chapter_4\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Essential Gear&lt;/h2&gt;When the route is in snow conditions, an ice axe and crampons are typically all that\'s needed. If you prefer the security of a rope, then a few pickets (or whatever your favorite snow anchor might be) would come in handy. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In ice conditions, crampons, two technical ice tools, plus 6-12 ice screws (the number depends on how far apart you plan to place them) are needed. There are few opportunities to place rock pro along the wall of the couloir, so spare yourself the extra weight and leave the rock gear at home.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A helmet is strongly recommended. This is a popular route. Unless you get lucky, there is likely to be another party above you. Peak baggers on the third class rock above the couloir can also knock things down on you inadvertantly.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;font size=\"-2\"&gt;5-1-06 1639&lt;/font&gt;                                                                &lt;a name=\"chapter_5\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Images&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div align=\"center\"&gt;&lt;table id=\"my_images\"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/kris-leading-the-final-pitch/127284/c-155838\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\" Kris leading the final pitch...\" src=\"/images/square/127284.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/middle-and-right-couloirs/224796/c-155838\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Middle and Right Couloirs\" src=\"/images/square/224796.JPG\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/taking-a-moment/351754/c-155838\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Taking a Moment....\" src=\"/images/square/351754.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/skiing-the-north-couloir-on/57434/c-155838\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Skiing the North Couloir on...\" src=\"/images/square/57434.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/kris-starts-the-first/127141/c-155838\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\" Kris starts the first...\" src=\"/images/square/127141.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/what-the-climbing-looks-like/127285/c-155838\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"What the climbing looks like...\" src=\"/images/square/127285.JPG\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/crossing-the-inlet-of/82349/c-155838\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Crossing the inlet of...\" src=\"/images/square/82349.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/on-the-lip-of-the-north/57433/c-155838\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"On the lip of the North...\" src=\"/images/square/57433.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/at-the-bottom-of-the-north/82352/c-155838\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"At the bottom of the North...\" src=\"/images/square/82352.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/9-october-2004-north-peak/73113/c-155838\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"9-October-2004: North Peak...\" src=\"/images/square/73113.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/tight-turns-in-the-north/82351/c-155838\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Tight turns in the North...\" src=\"/images/square/82351.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/meadows-from-the-couloir/537269/c-155838\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Meadows from the couloir\" src=\"/images/square/537269.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/yours-truly-tele-skiing-the/82350/c-155838\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Yours truly tele skiing the...\" src=\"/images/square/82350.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/left-couloir/224795/c-155838\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Left Couloir\" src=\"/images/square/224795.JPG\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td colspan=\"7\" align=\"center\"&gt;[ &lt;a href=\"/north-couloir/images/p-155838\"&gt;View Gallery - 8 More Images&lt;/a&gt; ]&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/article&gt;date:'),(173,156218,'/crescent-moon-couloir/156218','/round-top/150503','Crescent Moon Couloir','','','Class 3','','',12140,38.6636,-120,'California, United States, North America','','',150503,'Round Top','','1.0','Snow/ice climb','','Half a day','Route','content: &lt;article&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_1\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2 id=\"first_h2\"&gt;Approach&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;br&gt;Follow the approach for the &lt;a href=\"http://www.summitpost.com/mountains/route_link.pl/route_id/174/object_id/368\"&gt;Standard West Ridge&lt;/a&gt; route.

In winter it is filled with avalanche-prone snow, consolidating to hard snow/ice into late spring and summer. You can approach the base of the couloir by a variety of routes on the broad lower reaches of the North Face. Either choose a direct line from Lake Winnemucca, or any variation leaving the trail west of the lake.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;On the right side of the couloir a small flat platform may be found below just below a huge rock face. This provides a convenient place to switch from skis or snowshoes to crampons. The bottom of the couloir starts at 40 degrees, growing steeper as one climbs higher. One third of the way up, the couloir splits in two. The steeper left fork heads more directly to the higher east summit. The right fork (for which the Crescent Moon name derives) curves to the right before ending just right of the lower west summit. Once past the curve in the right fork, the slope exceeds 50 degrees and may be difficult to exit in soft snow conditions. Neither fork appears to form a cornice at the top, providing a straightforward exit in most conditions.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Though the overall angle of the left fork is steeper, it does not have the extreme steepness at the exit as does the right fork. It also leads more directly to the higher east summit, ending at notch between the two summits. This route seems to be used less used than the right fork, though no less enjoyable.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In general, the snow does not reach hard conditions until late in spring due to its protection from the sun. Conditions can vary within the couloir considerably. The snow in the middle section tends to be the hardest. This can be a real hazard for those considering a descent only. The snow may be soft for kicking steps for the first 50 yards down or so, then get progressively harder. This can be extremely trying on your legs and toes. Consider aborting a descent and retracing your route back up and then down the West Ridge if you get in trouble. Falling is not an option.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The attraction of this route is primarily as a winter ascent/descent. &lt;a href=\"http://www.summitpost.com/mountains/user_link.pl?user_id=7522\"&gt;Misha&lt;/a&gt; offers this comment for those considering a summer/fall climb: &lt;i&gt;Do not climb up or down this couloir during late summer / early fall months unless you enjoy miserable scree and occasional ice patches on a steep terrain. Rock-fall danger is extremely high, as many parties that pass above the couloir on the summit ridge drop rocks into it. One word to describe its no-snow conditions: NASTY!&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;table class=\"inline_image_thumbs\"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=46639\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/46639.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=5139\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/5139.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=46670\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/46670.JPG\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=46638\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/46638.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=5138\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/5138.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_3\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Essential Gear&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;br&gt;Crampons and axe for most conditions. Avalanche transponders are recommended if you are unsure of snow conditions in the chute. As a minimum, you should wait for the snow in the broad lower reaches of the North Face to consolidate before climbing. &lt;a href=\"http://www.summitpost.org/mountains/user_link.pl?user_id=19682\"&gt;rhyang&lt;/a&gt; adds: &lt;i&gt;In case you decide to rope up, the rock on the couloir walls seems crumbly and crappy.

Crossing the dish normally isn\'t an issue because the rock is solid here with good grip, however, if you did happen to fall about 10 feet down, you\'ll find yourself falling over a ledge and there\'s a long way to go before you hit bottom. A belay here is nice for some people. There\'s a tree about 5 feet away from the far end of the dish that you can use as an anchor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font style=\"font-weight:bold;\"&gt;Part 3&lt;/font&gt; (Class 3-) Once you get across the dish, you will see &lt;a href=\"http://www.summitpost.com/mountains/photo_link.pl?photo_id=9946&amp;amp;object_id=832&amp;amp;type=mountain&amp;amp;mountain_id=832&amp;amp;route_id=507\"&gt;the gully&lt;/a&gt; to your left. Climb the gully which will end at a small flat area between the rocks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font style=\"font-weight:bold;\"&gt;Part 4&lt;/font&gt; (Class 4-): You have two choices now. You can either climb \"the stairs\" or a gently sloping rock face with numerous holds (similar to chickenheads). There\'s one or two ledges before you get to the summit. There\'s more air on \"the stairs\" variation which is fun to use on the ascent, however, less experienced climbers will feel more comfortable taking the rock slabs down to the top of the gully. Here are photos &lt;a href=\"http://www.summitpost.com/mountains/photo_link.pl?photo_id=9954&amp;amp;object_id=832&amp;amp;type=mountain&amp;amp;mountain_id=832&amp;amp;route_id=507\"&gt;looking up the stairs&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"http://www.summitpost.com/mountains/photo_link.pl?photo_id=9953&amp;amp;object_id=832&amp;amp;type=mountain&amp;amp;mountain_id=832&amp;amp;route_id=507\"&gt;looking down the stairs&lt;/a&gt;.

I haven\'t found much information on this route, but at least &lt;a href=\"http://www.cosleyhouston.com/Sierra.htm#Crystal\"&gt;one guide outfit&lt;/a&gt; rates it a 5.4 rockclimb.  The more pedestrian route, yet still quite thrilling, is to follow the ridge as much as possible, but dropping below the ridge to climber\'s right (the east side) whenever the going on the ridge gets too gnarly.  This route is a middle of the road class 3, with some nice exposure &lt;a href=\"http://www.tahoebackcountry.net/features/crystalcrag/images/015_gregsummitridge.jpg\"&gt;towards the top&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The &lt;a href=\"http://www.tahoebackcountry.net/features/crystalcrag/images/024_tagthesummit.jpg\"&gt;actual summit&lt;/a&gt; is a diamond shaped block requiring some delicate balancing to get to.  However, there are about 5 \"sit-able\" &lt;a href=\"http://www.summitpost.com/mountains/photo_link.pl/p/photo_id__15759__object_id__1118__type__mountain__mountain_id__1118__route_id____user_id____order_by____limit__\"&gt;rocks&lt;/a&gt; about 2 feet lower than the main summit and only about 4 feet away.&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;table class=\"inline_image_thumbs\"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=8830\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/8830.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_3\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Essential Gear&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;br&gt;No essential gear required.

Both routes require some class 4 climbing before reaching the base of the summit block.&lt;br&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_2\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Route Description&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;br&gt;Thunderbolt\'s summit block is the most difficult of all the major peaks in the Sierra Nevada range, rated 5.8. The block itself is an impressive single chunk of granite 30ft high on the west side, 15ft high on the east. There are two 1/4 inch bolts at the top with an aluminum carabiner threaded through the eye of both bolt hangers. There are no bomber holds on the block, the top being particularly free of holds. The top also slopes at an angle of about 35 degrees, and there is room for no more than one or two persons at the same time. Currently you do not need to climb the summit block to sign the register which has been placed at the base of the block. But from time to time the register has been relocated on the summit block. It is a personal decision as to whether you must surmount the summit block in order to believe you have climbed Thunderbolt Peak.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The easiest route is on the west side where it goes 30ft with a great deal of exposure at 5.8. The east side is shorter, 12-15ft, with little exposure, but it is rated 5.9 and has a pointy granite block at the base that will skewer you should you peel in the attempt. If you can free climb the block by either of these routes, by all means do so. It will involve a minimum of additional equipment and you will earn considerable bragging rights. The rest of this description is for those mortals like myself that would prefer to aid the summit block.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There are a number of aid methods by which the summit block can be climbed. All involve a rope. If you used one to climb to the base, it will suffice. As a minimum, bring a 100ft, 7.5-8mm rope. A harness with a locking carbiner will also be helpful. The first step in all these aid methods is to lasso the summit block. the south side has a fine notch that will hold the rope nicely. the north side is not so clean - just make sure the rope doesn\'t drape over too close to the top (where it can pop off) or too far down (where it will make it more difficult to climb to the top of the block). Secure both ends of the rope to the rocks on the east side of the block. Now use on of the following:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Prussiks (or entrieres or stirrups). Attach these to the rope before you have secured the ends as described above. You must make sure the knots begin above the bend in the summit block, otherwise you will not be able to lift them past the point where the rope bends over the block on the northeast side. This isn\'t a pretty way to climb it, but seems to be the preferred method of the Sierra Club, judging from their trip reports.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Knots or loops in the rope. Before tying the ends of the rope off, tie a series of loops in the rope about a foot apart. A directional figure eight is a handy knot for this. The loops should be big enough to fit your boots through. As the knots are tied, pull the rope from the south side so that you have a trail of loops running from the base to the top of the block. These can then be used to climb the rope. Again, it is not pretty, but works. If you have a harness and carabiner, clip into the loops as you pass them to hold you in a fall. For safety, you should first attach the next loop to the carabiner before releasing the previous one. A more elegant way to use this system is to stem across to the summit block from another block just to the NE. This does not require great leg flexibility, but does require precise foot placement and a great deal of faith. Climb the block to the NE, and attach the highest loop possible to your harness. This will prevent serious injury by holding you should you fail in the step across to the summit block. Now, with your hands holding the highest reachable loops, step across to the summit block. Before moving on, attach higher loops to your harness and detach the lower loop(s). Push off the NE block and pull yourself up on the summit block. You should now be able to slowly walk up the sloping north side of the summit block, stopping to attach/detach successive loops. The moves are reversible (including the step across) to get yourself back down again.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A third method that has been employed requires sheer luck or precise rodeo abilities in being able to lasso the rope into the carabiner at the summit block (&lt;a href=\"//www.snwburd.com/bob/trip_reports/thunderbolt_1.html\"&gt;It has happened before&lt;/a&gt;). This allows a simpler pulley system to be used without the need to tie loops in the rope. Have the summitter attach one end of the rope to his harness and climb the NE block. Then, as he/she goes to step across onto the summit block, the other rope end is pulled by another person to assist and hold the climber on the summit block. A one-way hauling pulley or a rappel device on the pulling side can help make it safer and prevent the rope from going in the other direction. &lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;table class=\"inline_image_thumbs\"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=10583\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/10583.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=10585\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/10585.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=10582\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/10582.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=10584\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/10584.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_3\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Essential Gear&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;br&gt;Rope. A standard climbing rope is best, particularly if prussiking. If using one of the other methods, a narrower rope, 7.5-8mm will suffice. The rope should be at least 100ft long to accomodate loops and tying off the ends. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Harness with a locking carabiner. This is helpful as a safety aid to catch you in a fall. Not required for climbing or descending.&lt;br&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_4\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Miscellaneous Info&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;br&gt;If you have information about this route that doesn\'t pertain to any of the other sections, please add it here.&lt;br&gt;&lt;div align=\"center\"&gt;&lt;a name=\"messages\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_5\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Additions and Corrections&lt;/h2&gt;[ &lt;a href=\"/object_discussion.php?type=vote_comments&amp;amp;object_id=156888&amp;amp;is_addition=1#vote_form\"&gt;Post an Addition or Correction&lt;/a&gt; ]&lt;table cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" style=\"width: 775px;\"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;table cellpadding=\"2\" cellspacing=\"2\" width=\"100%\"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;&lt;span class=\"pagertext\"&gt;Viewing: &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;-&lt;b&gt;3&lt;/b&gt; of &lt;b&gt;3&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td align=\"center\"&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td align=\"right\"&gt;    &lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;table border=\"0\" width=\"775\" class=\"messages\"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td width=\"110\" align=\"left\" valign=\"top\" style=\"padding-top: 6px;\"&gt;&lt;a name=\"385181\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a class=\"dis_user_lnk\" href=\"/users/pellucidwombat/12893\"&gt;PellucidWombat&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td valign=\"top\" style=\"padding-top: 6px;\"&gt;&lt;b&gt;A few notes on aiding the summit block&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td align=\"right\" valign=\"top\" nowrap style=\"font-size: 10px;\"&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td valign=\"top\" rowspan=\"2\" align=\"left\" style=\"padding-top: 6px;\"&gt;&lt;p class=\"disc_avatar\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"/users/pellucidwombat/12893\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"PellucidWombat\" width=\"50\" height=\"50\" border=\"0\" src=\"/images/avatars/833128.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=\"font-size: 9px; color: #888;\"&gt;Voted 10/10&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td colspan=\"2\" style=\"padding-top: 6px;\"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Lassoing the block&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It is easiest to have only one person toss the rope while the other person holds a pre-coiled end to feed out. The better option is for the tosser to climb up high on a fin to the right (east) of the summit block and toss from there. To help get the rope over, droop some initial rope between the fin and the summit block. Tossing less rope is better than tossing more as the greater weight is difficult to get to clear the block.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;The Notch&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There is a \'ridge\' on the backside of the summit block that you cannot see. It has a small notch in it that catches the rope as you pull it up. This sets the rope nicely for aiding and helps a lot to prevent the rope from slipping up and over the top.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Aiding up the block&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There are some nice foot/hand holds on the left side of the crest that you aid up near. As the rope tends to cause you to swing to the right, using these holds helps hold you in line. I found it workable to just attach a ti-b lock above the \'step across\' corner, and pull on it to move up the rope while mostly climbing along the left crest.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Also, you can attach the prussic or ti-block to the rope after it has been tossed and secured.&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td valign=\"bottom\" style=\"padding-top: 6px;\" colspan=\"2\"&gt;&lt;span style=\"font-size: 9px; color: #888;\"&gt;Posted Jul 20, 2010 6:59 pm&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;table border=\"0\" width=\"775\" class=\"messages\"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td width=\"110\" align=\"left\" valign=\"top\" style=\"padding-top: 6px;\"&gt;&lt;a name=\"387245\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a class=\"dis_user_lnk\" href=\"/users/ski/47531\"&gt;SKI&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td valign=\"top\" style=\"padding-top: 6px;\"&gt;&lt;b&gt;For those who don\'t mind a spoiler...&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td align=\"right\" valign=\"top\" nowrap style=\"font-size: 10px;\"&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td valign=\"top\" rowspan=\"2\" align=\"left\" style=\"padding-top: 6px;\"&gt;&lt;p class=\"disc_avatar\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"/users/ski/47531\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"SKI\" width=\"50\" height=\"50\" border=\"0\" src=\"/images/avatars/909751.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=\"font-size: 9px; color: #888;\"&gt;Hasn\'t voted&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td colspan=\"2\" style=\"padding-top: 6px;\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WG9WOF7r_tQ\"&gt;This&lt;/a&gt; is a youtube of Glenn Gookin leading the sucker, video by Tom Becht.&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td valign=\"bottom\" style=\"padding-top: 6px;\" colspan=\"2\"&gt;&lt;span style=\"font-size: 9px; color: #888;\"&gt;Posted Aug 5, 2010 9:44 pm&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;table border=\"0\" width=\"775\" class=\"messages\"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td width=\"110\" align=\"left\" valign=\"top\" style=\"padding-top: 6px;\"&gt;&lt;a name=\"473735\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a class=\"dis_user_lnk\" href=\"/users/mark-m/38778\"&gt;Mark M&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td valign=\"top\" style=\"padding-top: 6px;\"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Using Prusiks&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td align=\"right\" valign=\"top\" nowrap style=\"font-size: 10px;\"&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td valign=\"top\" rowspan=\"2\" align=\"left\" style=\"padding-top: 6px;\"&gt;&lt;p class=\"disc_avatar\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"/users/mark-m/38778\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Mark M\" width=\"50\" height=\"50\" border=\"0\" src=\"/images/avatars/621534.JPG\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=\"font-size: 9px; color: #888;\"&gt;Hasn\'t voted&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td colspan=\"2\" style=\"padding-top: 6px;\"&gt;This is the method &lt;a href=\"http://www.summitpost.org/users/cab/56866\"&gt;cab&lt;/a&gt;  and I used to climb the summit block.

This is an excellent ice climb.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A note on the rating - the old Roper guide rated this climb III, 5.6 / AI2 or WI3, as does the current Secor guide book. The Sierra Classics guide ( Moynier &amp;amp; Fiddler ) calls it class 4 - 5. This is probably a more realistic rating, but there are several ways to finish  the last pitch, so I\'ll leave the original rating. If there is fresh snow on the final slabs, you better be able to lead 5.6!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Descend the class 2 Southeast slope route to Treasure Col ( see the High Sierra guide book by R. J. Secor ) or, if you\'re camped below the North Face, I\'ve used this descent - rappel or downclimb from the summit back to the top of the couloir. Continue descending to the west down a rock chute ( rappels ) until one is able to climb through the notch west of Mt. Gilbert and back to the cirque north of the peak. &lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;table class=\"inline_image_thumbs\"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=11852\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/11852.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=11674\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/11674.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=11853\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/11853.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=11851\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/11851.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=125597\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/125597.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_3\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Essential Gear&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;br&gt;Ice axe and north wall hammer, crampons, rope and a light rack, a few screws.&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;table class=\"inline_image_thumbs\"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=142408\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/142408.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_4\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Miscellaneous Info&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;br&gt;If you have information about this route that doesn\'t pertain to any of the other sections, please add it here.&lt;br&gt;&lt;div align=\"center\"&gt;&lt;a name=\"messages\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_5\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Additions and Corrections&lt;/h2&gt;[ &lt;a href=\"/object_discussion.php?type=vote_comments&amp;amp;object_id=157002&amp;amp;is_addition=1#vote_form\"&gt;Post an Addition or Correction&lt;/a&gt; ]&lt;table cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" style=\"width: 775px;\"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;table cellpadding=\"2\" cellspacing=\"2\" width=\"100%\"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;&lt;span class=\"pagertext\"&gt;Viewing: &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;-&lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt; of &lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td align=\"center\"&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td align=\"right\"&gt;    &lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;table border=\"0\" width=\"775\" class=\"messages\"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td width=\"110\" align=\"left\" valign=\"top\" style=\"padding-top: 6px;\"&gt;&lt;a name=\"109124\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a class=\"dis_user_lnk\" href=\"/users/pellucidwombat/12893\"&gt;PellucidWombat&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td valign=\"top\" style=\"padding-top: 6px;\"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Route Comment&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td align=\"right\" valign=\"top\" nowrap style=\"font-size: 10px;\"&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td valign=\"top\" rowspan=\"2\" align=\"left\" style=\"padding-top: 6px;\"&gt;&lt;p class=\"disc_avatar\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"/users/pellucidwombat/12893\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"PellucidWombat\" width=\"50\" height=\"50\" border=\"0\" src=\"/images/avatars/833128.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=\"font-size: 9px; color: #888;\"&gt;Hasn\'t voted&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td colspan=\"2\" style=\"padding-top: 6px;\"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Rock Pitch:&lt;/u&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r&lt;br&gt;If you head straight towards the large chimney above the couloir, this is the 5.5-5.6 variation, which requires climbing a short section of thin parallel cracks. To climb the class 4 variation, descend the south side of the saddle a short ways and find your way up slabs to the left.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r&lt;br&gt;&lt;u&gt;Descent:&lt;/u&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r&lt;br&gt;As we were concerned about finding our way down the rapps, we found another descent route (albeit a little longer) to get back to camp if you\'re camped at the base of the North Couloir. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r&lt;br&gt;Descend the SE slopes of Mt Gilbert to pass 12,400\' and descend the couloir. When we did this, it was filled with hard neve, but there were several nice rapp stations to use (the first is about 30 ft down from the top). &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r&lt;br&gt;From there, cut across the bowl staying fairly high. You want to cut around the ridge on a lightly forested slope between a set of cliffs at 11,600\'. This puts you back in the correct drainage to reach camp with minimal elevation loss.&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td valign=\"bottom\" style=\"padding-top: 6px;\" colspan=\"2\"&gt;&lt;span style=\"font-size: 9px; color: #888;\"&gt;Posted Dec 24, 2005 4:14 pm&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;table border=\"0\" width=\"745\" class=\"messages\" style=\"margin-left: 30px;\"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td rowspan=\"4\" valign=\"top\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/styles/layout/reply_arrow.gif\"&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td width=\"110\" align=\"left\" valign=\"top\" style=\"padding-top: 6px;\"&gt;&lt;a name=\"109434\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a class=\"dis_user_lnk\" href=\"/users/craig-peer/5092\"&gt;Craig Peer&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td valign=\"top\" style=\"padding-top: 6px;\"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Route Comment&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td align=\"right\" valign=\"top\" nowrap style=\"font-size: 10px;\"&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td valign=\"top\" rowspan=\"2\" align=\"left\" style=\"padding-top: 6px;\"&gt;&lt;p class=\"disc_avatar\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"/users/craig-peer/5092\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Craig Peer\" width=\"50\" height=\"50\" border=\"0\" src=\"/images/avatars/111278.JPG\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=\"font-size: 9px; color: #888;\"&gt;Hasn\'t voted&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td colspan=\"2\" style=\"padding-top: 6px;\"&gt;Thanks for the additional information.&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td valign=\"bottom\" style=\"padding-top: 6px;\" colspan=\"2\"&gt;&lt;span style=\"font-size: 9px; color: #888;\"&gt;Posted Dec 27, 2005 1:07 pm&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;table border=\"0\" width=\"775\"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;table cellpadding=\"2\" cellspacing=\"2\" width=\"100%\"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;&lt;span class=\"pagertext\"&gt;Viewing: &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;-&lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt; of &lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td align=\"center\"&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td align=\"right\"&gt;    &lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_6\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Images&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div align=\"center\"&gt;&lt;table id=\"my_images\"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/september-24th-2005-sp/142405/c-157002\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"September 24th, 2005 - SP...\" src=\"/images/square/142405.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/mt-gilbert-north-couloir/243653/c-157002\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Mt.

When the ridge begins merging with the Northeast Face, stay a good ways below the North Arete and traverse south and up to the summit. This last section has some class 4 climbing. Climbing to the North Arete to soon ( to far north ) will increase both difficulties, exposure and excitement! &lt;br&gt;Descend the Northwest side ( Ulrichs Route ).&lt;br&gt;This is an excellent route - one of the 100 Classics of the High Sierra! &lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;table class=\"inline_image_thumbs\"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=12287\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/12287.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=12133\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/12133.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=12125\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/12125.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=12123\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/12123.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=110204\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/110204.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_3\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Essential Gear&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;br&gt;While many climbers could climb this route unroped, I recommend a spartan rock rack, a few runners and at least a 9mm rope for most climbers.

Would have been easier to summit if traverse south had been made prior to meeting N arete at the ridge top. My recommendation is to to traverse South about 300 feet below the summit ridge and meet the summit without accessing the summit ridge until the end. Any questions feel free to email me. Otherwise a very cool climb.

I would like to add that if for some reason you decide to let your pack fall down to the snowy slope 300 ft below you, make sure you don\'t have your rappelling rope in it. Its kind of hard to rappel when your rope is already at the bottom of the mountain! Sound familiar ZCANDO??&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r&lt;br&gt;other than that, its a beautiful climb!&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td valign=\"bottom\" style=\"padding-top: 6px;\" colspan=\"2\"&gt;&lt;span style=\"font-size: 9px; color: #888;\"&gt;Posted Oct 18, 2002 9:05 pm&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;table border=\"0\" width=\"745\" class=\"messages\" style=\"margin-left: 30px;\"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td rowspan=\"4\" valign=\"top\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/styles/layout/reply_arrow.gif\"&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td width=\"110\" align=\"left\" valign=\"top\" style=\"padding-top: 6px;\"&gt;&lt;a name=\"3927\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a class=\"dis_user_lnk\" href=\"/users/zcando/8559\"&gt;zcando&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td valign=\"top\" style=\"padding-top: 6px;\"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Route Comment&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td align=\"right\" valign=\"top\" nowrap style=\"font-size: 10px;\"&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td valign=\"top\" rowspan=\"2\" align=\"left\" style=\"padding-top: 6px;\"&gt;&lt;p class=\"disc_avatar\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"/users/zcando/8559\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"zcando\" width=\"50\" height=\"50\" border=\"0\" src=\"/images/avatars/12802.JPG\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=\"font-size: 9px; color: #888;\"&gt;Hasn\'t voted&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td colspan=\"2\" style=\"padding-top: 6px;\"&gt;Who dropped the pack?&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td valign=\"bottom\" style=\"padding-top: 6px;\" colspan=\"2\"&gt;&lt;span style=\"font-size: 9px; color: #888;\"&gt;Posted Oct 22, 2002 10:27 pm&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;table border=\"0\" width=\"745\" class=\"messages\" style=\"margin-left: 30px;\"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td rowspan=\"4\" valign=\"top\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/styles/layout/reply_arrow.gif\"&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td width=\"110\" align=\"left\" valign=\"top\" style=\"padding-top: 6px;\"&gt;&lt;a name=\"85471\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a class=\"dis_user_lnk\" href=\"/users/craig-peer/5092\"&gt;Craig Peer&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td valign=\"top\" style=\"padding-top: 6px;\"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Route Comment&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td align=\"right\" valign=\"top\" nowrap style=\"font-size: 10px;\"&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td valign=\"top\" rowspan=\"2\" align=\"left\" style=\"padding-top: 6px;\"&gt;&lt;p class=\"disc_avatar\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"/users/craig-peer/5092\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Craig Peer\" width=\"50\" height=\"50\" border=\"0\" src=\"/images/avatars/111278.JPG\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=\"font-size: 9px; color: #888;\"&gt;Hasn\'t voted&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td colspan=\"2\" style=\"padding-top: 6px;\"&gt;Except it isn\'t class 4 if you cut up to the ridge - just pointing that out Eric.

From the top of Thunderbolt, if ascended from a different route, it is necessary to descend to the notch between Starlight and Thunderbolt.  There are 2 ways to accomplish this.  Weave your way around the summit blocks in a southeasterly direction until you reach a short , steep headwall.  You may either descend the headwall (~5.6, maybe a bit less), or veer left to find the top of a chimney.  Descend the chimney  (class 4), and at the bottom traverse left to easy slabs.  This is where the headwall route is re-joined.  From here, descend easy slabs to the notch. &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;table class=\"inline_image_thumbs\"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=12245\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/12245.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=12243\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/12243.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=12247\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/12247.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=12244\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/12244.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_2\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Route Description&lt;/h2&gt;From the notch between Starlight and Thunderbolt, climb up for 40-50 feet, staying just below the crest of the ridge.The climbing will tend toward the ridgeline, and you should join the ridgeline when practicable.  Stay on or very near the ridgeline until just below the Milk Bottle.  Traverse out right on ledges until you encounter a corner leading up just left of the Milk Bottle.  Climb this corner, and aim for the Milk Bottle, and from there, you know the rest!  This is certainly not the only way to make the traverse, just the easiest I\'ve found. &lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;table class=\"inline_image_thumbs\"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=12246\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/12246.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=65891\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/65891.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=65893\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/65893.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=65894\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/65894.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_3\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Essential Gear&lt;/h2&gt;If you made it to the top of Thunderbolt, you have all the gear you need.  If you are not comfortable with short sections of 5th class climbing unroped, then bring along a rope and a little gear.  You shouldn\'t need more than a handful of stoppers.  There is very little chance of rockfall on this route, so a helmet is personal choice.&lt;br&gt;&lt;div align=\"center\"&gt;&lt;a name=\"messages\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_4\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Additions and Corrections&lt;/h2&gt;[ &lt;a href=\"/object_discussion.php?type=vote_comments&amp;amp;object_id=157074&amp;amp;is_addition=1#vote_form\"&gt;Post an Addition or Correction&lt;/a&gt; ]&lt;table cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" style=\"width: 775px;\"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;table cellpadding=\"2\" cellspacing=\"2\" width=\"100%\"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;&lt;span class=\"pagertext\"&gt;Viewing: &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;-&lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt; of &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td align=\"center\"&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td align=\"right\"&gt;    &lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;table border=\"0\" width=\"775\" class=\"messages\"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td width=\"110\" align=\"left\" valign=\"top\" style=\"padding-top: 6px;\"&gt;&lt;a name=\"385177\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a class=\"dis_user_lnk\" href=\"/users/pellucidwombat/12893\"&gt;PellucidWombat&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td valign=\"top\" style=\"padding-top: 6px;\"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Rappel Stations&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td align=\"right\" valign=\"top\" nowrap style=\"font-size: 10px;\"&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td valign=\"top\" rowspan=\"2\" align=\"left\" style=\"padding-top: 6px;\"&gt;&lt;p class=\"disc_avatar\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"/users/pellucidwombat/12893\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"PellucidWombat\" width=\"50\" height=\"50\" border=\"0\" src=\"/images/avatars/833128.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=\"font-size: 9px; color: #888;\"&gt;Hasn\'t voted&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td colspan=\"2\" style=\"padding-top: 6px;\"&gt;You can rappel past the 5.6 section to the ledge that traverses to the easy slabs. I made an anchor at the top, which barely reaches the ledge with a 70m rope. If you start below the first steep section, there are some old solid pitons that could be reinforced for an anchor that could work with a 60m rope. The bottom is very steep, so take care not to rappel with a rope that is too short!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Also, in the event that you want to bail down the Underhill Couloir, it has good and new rappel stations.&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td valign=\"bottom\" style=\"padding-top: 6px;\" colspan=\"2\"&gt;&lt;span style=\"font-size: 9px; color: #888;\"&gt;Posted Jul 20, 2010 6:38 pm&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;table border=\"0\" width=\"775\"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;table cellpadding=\"2\" cellspacing=\"2\" width=\"100%\"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;&lt;span class=\"pagertext\"&gt;Viewing: &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;-&lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt; of &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td align=\"center\"&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td align=\"right\"&gt;    &lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_5\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Images&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div align=\"center\"&gt;&lt;table id=\"my_images\"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/exposure/326008/c-157074\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Exposure\" src=\"/images/square/326008.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/descending-t-bolt/322848/c-157074\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"descending t-bolt\" src=\"/images/square/322848.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/palisade-glacier/322849/c-157074\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"palisade glacier\" src=\"/images/square/322849.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/manly-pose-on-starlight-profile/632950/c-157074\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Manly Pose on Starlight (Profile)\" src=\"/images/square/632950.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/underhill-couloir-to-starlight/633106/c-157074\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Underhill Couloir to Starlight\" src=\"/images/square/633106.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/underhill-couloir-to-starlight-close/633107/c-157074\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Underhill Couloir to Starlight (close)\" src=\"/images/square/633107.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/this-photo-depicts-the/12245/c-157074\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\" This photo depicts the...\" src=\"/images/square/12245.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/the-route-follows-this-line/12246/c-157074\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\" The route follows this line,...\" src=\"/images/square/12246.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/thunderbolt-to-underhill-couloir/633108/c-157074\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Thunderbolt to Underhill Couloir\" src=\"/images/square/633108.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/this-is-a-close-view-of-the/12247/c-157074\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\" This is a close view of the...\" src=\"/images/square/12247.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/the-ridge-between-thunderbolt/65893/c-157074\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"The ridge between Thunderbolt...\" src=\"/images/square/65893.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/the-route-listed-begins-at/12243/c-157074\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\" The route listed begins at...\" src=\"/images/square/12243.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/the-thunderbolt-summits-from-the-nw-ridge/640833/c-157074\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"The Thunderbolt summits from the NW Ridge\" src=\"/images/square/640833.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/sill-and-starlight-from-near/65894/c-157074\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Sill and Starlight from near...\" src=\"/images/square/65894.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td colspan=\"7\" align=\"center\"&gt;[ &lt;a href=\"/traverse-from-thunderbolt/images/p-157074\"&gt;View Gallery - 14 More Images&lt;/a&gt; ]&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/article&gt;date:'),(181,157134,'/mount-olympus-trail/157134','/mount-olympus/151263','Mount Olympus Trail','','','Class 3 (YDS)','','',26642,40.657,-111.77,'Utah, United States, North America','','',151263,'Mount Olympus','','1.0','Trail/Scramble','','Half a day','Route','content: &lt;article&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_1\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2 id=\"first_h2\"&gt;Approach&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;br&gt;Use the information provided in the &lt;a href=\"http://www.summitpost.com/mountains/display_component.pl?type=component&amp;amp;mountain_id=1396&amp;amp;route_id=&amp;amp;component_id=14290&amp;amp;object_id=14290\"&gt;main page&lt;/a&gt; to get to the \"Mount Olympus Trailhead\".&lt;br&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_2\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Route Description&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;br&gt;Simply follow the trail.  The first 1400 feet of ascent is a steep, but not troublesome, climb along the north side of Tolcate Canyon.  After crossing Tolcate Creek, however, the trail steepens considerably.  Climb another 2000 feet over merely 1.5 miles to Olympus\'s South shoulder and take in excellent views to the south and east. Most of the remaining 600 feet to the summit is gained by scrambling over straightforward class 3 terrain.  Warning, the smooth quartzite rock that you\'ll encounter tends to be a bit slick when dry, murderously slippery when wet.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This &lt;a href=\"http://www.topozone.com/map.asp?z=12&amp;amp;n=4500275&amp;amp;e=433375&amp;amp;s=50&amp;amp;size=l&amp;amp;u=0&amp;amp;layer=DRG25\"&gt;topographic map&lt;/a&gt; nicely illustrates the route.

In the late summer months, no water is found along the route.  However, as the route is so short (3.5 miles one way to the summit), you needn\'t worry too much.  Rock shoes are unnecessary, though your footwear should grip well and have enough stability for the punishing, rocky descent.&lt;br&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_4\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Miscellaneous Info&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;br&gt;If you have information about this route that doesn\'t pertain to any of the other sections, please add it here.&lt;br&gt;&lt;div align=\"center\"&gt;&lt;a name=\"messages\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_5\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Additions and Corrections&lt;/h2&gt;[ &lt;a href=\"/object_discussion.php?type=vote_comments&amp;amp;object_id=157134&amp;amp;is_addition=1#vote_form\"&gt;Post an Addition or Correction&lt;/a&gt; ]&lt;table cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" style=\"width: 775px;\"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;table cellpadding=\"2\" cellspacing=\"2\" width=\"100%\"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;&lt;span class=\"pagertext\"&gt;Viewing: &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;-&lt;b&gt;4&lt;/b&gt; of &lt;b&gt;4&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td align=\"center\"&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td align=\"right\"&gt;    &lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;table border=\"0\" width=\"775\" class=\"messages\"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td width=\"110\" align=\"left\" valign=\"top\" style=\"padding-top: 6px;\"&gt;&lt;a name=\"75014\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a class=\"dis_user_lnk\" href=\"/users/pellucidwombat/12893\"&gt;PellucidWombat&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td valign=\"top\" style=\"padding-top: 6px;\"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Route Comment&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td align=\"right\" valign=\"top\" nowrap style=\"font-size: 10px;\"&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td valign=\"top\" rowspan=\"2\" align=\"left\" style=\"padding-top: 6px;\"&gt;&lt;p class=\"disc_avatar\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"/users/pellucidwombat/12893\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"PellucidWombat\" width=\"50\" height=\"50\" border=\"0\" src=\"/images/avatars/833128.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=\"font-size: 9px; color: #888;\"&gt;Hasn\'t voted&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td colspan=\"2\" style=\"padding-top: 6px;\"&gt;Here\'s a little variation I found that avoids hiking Blister Hill and adds some fun scrambling to the ascent.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r&lt;br&gt;&lt;u&gt;Arete Variation:&lt;/u&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Length:&lt;/b&gt; 500 vertical feet&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Rating:&lt;/b&gt; 5.2&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r&lt;br&gt;From Tolcat Creek, follow the regular trail until the first switchback. From there, deal with about 100 ft of moderate bushwacking south to reach the rocky rib. Many variations are possible, and the climbing is more difficult the closer one stays to the ridge. (There is another ridge further south, but I stayed on the northernmost one)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r&lt;br&gt;Apart from a few short detours to the side to avoid some roofs and +5.7 stuff, I was able to stay on the arete. The climbing was mostly 3rd-4th class, with occasional 5th class moves. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r&lt;br&gt;While there are definitely places that you don\'t want to fall, the exposure isn\'t too bad and you have nice views of the valley &amp;amp; the Mount Olympus Trail below.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r&lt;br&gt;Near the end one is confronted with some exposed face climbing with small handholds on the north side of the arete, but there is enough in the way of a faint ledge system that you can mostly edge up this part.

Start up the trail towards Avalanche Gulch but instead of following the trail left towards Horse Camp, ascent a ridge (Broadway) which will lead the climber right towards Green Butte. Green Butte Ridge is the ridge East (Right) of Avalanche Gulch, and offers a more direct line to the summit than Casaval Ridge (on the West side of Avalanche Gulch). One may join the ridge at any point before about 10,200ft. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div align=\"center\" class=\"image\" style=\"width: 506px;\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"/there-is-nothing-green-about-green-butte/317326\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"There is Nothing Green about Green Butte\" height=\"372\" width=\"500\" src=\"/images/medium/317326.JPG\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=\"caption\"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_2\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Route Description&lt;/h2&gt;The Green Butte Ridge proper begins at about 9200\', just above Green Butte (El. 9193\').  Ascend this sometimes narrow ridge approximately 3000\' to a rock outcropping known as \"The Thumb\" (El.12,923\'). During Winter months this ridge can be knife-edge in certain areas with exposed class 3 rock encountered. After winter storms the slopes are more gradual and rock is mostly covered. There are several great opportunities to camp directly on the ridge, especially at about 10,200ft. Above 10,200ft camp site the ridge begins to steepen and move towards the junction of Green Butte and Sargent\'s ridge. Steepest traverses towards the junction are mabe 40 degrees at most. Before the junction one may encounter some class 3 rock during dry years. Stay on the crest of the ridge and move to the snow slopes on the East (right) side to continue towards scree and the junction with Sargent\'s ridge. From there one may choose to climb over the crest of the ridge all the way to the Thumb, but it will involve a few class 5 moves on unstable volcanic rock. Ridges merge between Shastarama point and the Thumb at about 12,200 ft. While on the East side of the ridge continue traversing up on the snow slopes above Mud Creek Glacier. Climber may choose to cross to the other side of the ridge or continue traversing all the way till moderate to steep slopes allow an exit towards the Thumb.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Past The Thumb climb up and left toward Misery Hill, following the path of least resistance. Ascent Misery Hill and continue across the football field sized plateau towards the summit rocks. &lt;br&gt;Descend the route or Avalanche Gulch if desired.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;table class=\"inline_image_thumbs\"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=19923\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/19923.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=48588\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/48588.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=41040\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/41040.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=90163\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/90163.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=90164\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/90164.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_3\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Essential Gear&lt;/h2&gt;Crampons and ice axe are required to climb this route. One may want to bring snow shoes and trekking poles for approach. If group does not feel comfortable traversing up to 55 degree snow/hard icy slopes pickets may be useful to protect steep and exposed sections. Bringing pickets or ice screws will require roping up. I have never done that, but seen people with ropes with harnesses on. Contact Ranger station for current information on the route. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Mt.

The biggest chute between the 2nd and 3rd cliffs is the route.  Slog up sandy talus, then onto cleaner rock about halfway up the chute.  When the chute above begins to narrow to an overhanging coulior STOP.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;To the left is a cliff with a dainty, well marked catwalk.  It\'s not over conspicious, but if it looks exposed, you found the right one.  As of Sept. 2005, cairns clearly marked the beginning of the catwalk.  Head out, and slightly down on this catwalk, until reaching the very outside of the chute, and around the corner of the cliff.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Climb up 3rd/4th class ledges and cracks, then scramble over a small hump and up into a second chute.  This chute narrows with short sections of stemming or face climbing to get past, when in doubt, stick to the left side of the coulior.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The second coulior ends in the famous \'bowl\', with the summit within reach.  Following the natural line straight up and left ends in a drop-off.  Instead head for the boulders of the summit ridge up and right.  The boulders must be hopped over, squeezed between, edged around, and in general just figured out, until suddenly the summit is upon you.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Descent:  It\'s faster to rappel from the summit to the bowl than to repeat the boulder antics, then it\'s a straight shot down the coulior.  Two short rappels are required in the coulior.  The catwalk is actually  a little easier on the descent.&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;table class=\"inline_image_thumbs\"&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=7171\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/7171.jpg\" unselectable=\"on\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=16405\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/16405.jpg\" unselectable=\"on\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=40771\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/40771.jpg\" unselectable=\"on\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_3\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Essential Gear&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;br&gt;A single 50 or 60 meter rope speeds up the descents, though competent parties shouldn\'t need it on the lead.  The 4th class sections are surprisingly steep, but not sustained.

I\'ll look into it.  Probably from an earlier version of Summitpost, and things havn\'t been corrected since.  I\'m sticking to the description of where to camp though, as there is really only one way to descend from the pass, and it\'s hard to miss.  My point was that there is a place there to camp if you\'re looking to get a head start on the next day\'s climb.  But yeah, for sure, gotta get the right coordinates in place.

Despite its name, this is not the original ascent line.  That ascent line (begins near the northwest corner of the pillar and goes to top via West Side Cave) is an archaic bolt ladder which no longer gets climbed (see book for more details).  A. Watts\' guidebook describes the route in five pitches:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Pitch 1:&lt;/b&gt;  4th class.  From the small trees move over exposed 4th class rock towards the &lt;a href=\"http://www.summitpost.com/mountains/photo_link.pl/p/photo_id__37241__object_id__1695__type__mountain__mountain_id__1695__route_id____user_id____order_by____limit__\"&gt;low-angle ramp&lt;/a&gt; running at the base of the north face of Monkey.  Find a single bolt.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Pitch 2:&lt;/b&gt;  5.5 (trad).  Move up the &lt;a href=\"http://www.summitpost.com/mountains/photo_link.pl/p/photo_id__37241__object_id__1695__type__mountain__mountain_id__1695__route_id____user_id____order_by____limit__\"&gt;low-angle ramp&lt;/a&gt; toward the &lt;a href=\"http://www.summitpost.org/images/original/126583.jpg\"&gt;notch&lt;/a&gt; between Monkey Face and below the Springboard.  Make a few 5.5 moves to reach top of notch.  Move to the other side of notch onto the &lt;a href=\"http://www.summitpost.com/mountains/photo_link.pl/p/photo_id__37239__object_id__1695__type__mountain__mountain_id__1695__route_id____user_id____order_by____limit__\"&gt;exposed face&lt;/a&gt; (a #3 Camalot works well in a crack here).  Climb up past a drilled piton and one bolt to Bohn Street - a wide ledge with plenty of belay bolts.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://www.summitpost.org/route/160082/west-face-variation.html\"&gt;&lt;i&gt;West Face Variation&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (5.8) allows you to substitute those standard first two pitches to Bohn Street Ledge with some quality climbing (either 2 or 3 pitches) from the west side.  Highly recommended!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://www.summitpost.org/image/490089/157716/pioneer-route.html\"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Pitch 3:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;  A0.  Move up from Bohn Street following the obvious bolt line towards the mouth cave.  The bolts are new and bomber.  There are approximately 18 bolts.  The wall goes from vertical to slightly overhung.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://www.summitpost.org/view_object.php?object_id=67443\"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Pitch 4:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;  5.7 (bolted).  This pitch is named \"Panic Point\".  It is only about 20 feet long but the exposure is extreme.  From the east side of the mouth, step out of the cave and climb up to a large boulder (Monkey\'s nose) about 20 feet above the cave.  There is a pair of bolts which can be clipped before stepping out of the cave and the rest of the route has very closely spaced bolts.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://www.summitpost.org/route/167256/monkey-off-my-back.html\"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Monkey Off My Back&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; provides a variation finishing pitch (all the way to the summit) at 5.8.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://www.summitpost.org/view_object.php?object_id=67389&amp;amp;context_id=157716\"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Pitch 5:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;  5.4.  Move left and up onto the nose of the Monkey and then make a wide step onto its forehead.  Easy and unexposed scrambling leads to the spacious summit.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Descent:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Do a short (but akward) rappel from a pair of bolts right below the summit (you\'ll see them while scrambling on the way up) to the &lt;a href=\"http://www.summitpost.org/view_object.php?object_id=490155\"&gt;pair of bolts&lt;/a&gt; atop pitch 4 (i.e. bolts are in Monkey\'s nose).  Do a double rope (60 meter ropes) rappel from the \"nose\" bolts all the way to the ground.  This is a \"free air\" rappel for about 100 of the 180 total feet.  It is one of the climb\'s highlights.&lt;a name=\"chapter_3\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Essential Gear&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;div align=\"center\" class=\"image-left\" style=\"width: 156px;\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"/pioneer-route/67671\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Pioneer Route\" height=\"200\" width=\"150\" src=\"/images/small/67671.JPG\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=\"caption\"&gt;P3 ladder&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div align=\"center\" class=\"image-right\" style=\"width: 156px;\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"/monkey-face-as-seen-from-the/31753\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Monkey Face as seen from the...\" height=\"200\" width=\"150\" src=\"/images/small/31753.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=\"caption\"&gt;Climbers on Bolt Ladder&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br&gt;A light traditional rack (depends on your comfort climbing the exposed 5.5 pitch).  A few small cams ( #3 Camelot provides a \"bomber\" piece once you cross over through the notch).  A few mid-sized wired stoppers.  At least 10 (preferably more) QD\'s for the bolt ladder (depends on personal comfort), etriers, two daisy chains, two 60 meter ropes, and possibly a short cheat stick for shorter climbers.

According to them, this pitch has all been recently rebolted but the lowest (bottom) bolt is now removed or missing.  So there is about 6 or 7 feet of unprotected climbing above Bohn Street to the first bolt.  There was one decent handhold along a groove about 4 feet up all chalked up that looked like a popular hold to get to that first bolt.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r&lt;br&gt;I am not sure how many anchor bolts there were on Bohn Street before but there are 4 there now spaced nicely apart along the ledge.&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td valign=\"bottom\" style=\"padding-top: 6px;\" colspan=\"2\"&gt;&lt;span style=\"font-size: 9px; color: #888;\"&gt;Posted Feb 20, 2003 9:28 am&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;table border=\"0\" width=\"775\" class=\"messages\"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td width=\"110\" align=\"left\" valign=\"top\" style=\"padding-top: 6px;\"&gt;&lt;a name=\"90873\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a class=\"dis_user_lnk\" href=\"/users/diggler/453\"&gt;Diggler&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td valign=\"top\" style=\"padding-top: 6px;\"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Route Comment&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td align=\"right\" valign=\"top\" nowrap style=\"font-size: 10px;\"&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td valign=\"top\" rowspan=\"2\" align=\"left\" style=\"padding-top: 6px;\"&gt;&lt;p class=\"disc_avatar\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"/users/diggler/453\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Diggler\" width=\"50\" height=\"50\" border=\"0\" src=\"/images/avatars/816079.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=\"font-size: 9px; color: #888;\"&gt;Hasn\'t voted&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td colspan=\"2\" style=\"padding-top: 6px;\"&gt;Wouldn\'t A0 basically be the equivalent of French Free, i.e. stepping/pulling on gear/bolts/pins? If one uses aiders (as the great majority does) it seems like A1 would be a more appropriate rating for the climb (isn\'t that what the guidebook calls it?). I guess most of the bolts are so closely spaced that it might be possible to just climb pulling on them, but it also seems that that would still be a pretty extraordinary pain-in-the-ass. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r&lt;br&gt;There is currently an &lt;i&gt;overabundance&lt;/i&gt; of bolts on Bohn St (well, everywhere on the formation- maybe not the .13/.14 routes). Indeed, if this formation were in Tuolumne Meadows, probably 80% of those bolts would be chopped within 3 days or so. Then again, I guess we\'re not talking Tuolumne Granite either...&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td valign=\"bottom\" style=\"padding-top: 6px;\" colspan=\"2\"&gt;&lt;span style=\"font-size: 9px; color: #888;\"&gt;Posted Sep 6, 2005 1:24 pm&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;table border=\"0\" width=\"745\" class=\"messages\" style=\"margin-left: 30px;\"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td rowspan=\"4\" valign=\"top\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/styles/layout/reply_arrow.gif\"&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td width=\"110\" align=\"left\" valign=\"top\" style=\"padding-top: 6px;\"&gt;&lt;a name=\"90884\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a class=\"dis_user_lnk\" href=\"/users/rpc/794\"&gt;rpc&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td valign=\"top\" style=\"padding-top: 6px;\"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Route Comment&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td align=\"right\" valign=\"top\" nowrap style=\"font-size: 10px;\"&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td valign=\"top\" rowspan=\"2\" align=\"left\" style=\"padding-top: 6px;\"&gt;&lt;p class=\"disc_avatar\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"/users/rpc/794\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"rpc\" width=\"50\" height=\"50\" border=\"0\" src=\"/images/avatars/484610.JPG\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=\"font-size: 9px; color: #888;\"&gt;Hasn\'t voted&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td colspan=\"2\" style=\"padding-top: 6px;\"&gt;Hi Dirk,&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r&lt;br&gt;How did you like Monkey?

Aiding was interesting- quite a departure from free climbing. Did the aptly-named Panic Pt. in the dark- 5.7 or not, it scared the s&amp;amp;$t out of me! The deep, sucking void down below, as well as noticing a sharp edge over which the rope ran from the belay cave had me clinging to those buckets for dear life! Free rappel in the dark was great too! &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r&lt;br&gt;3 Sisters Marathon became a 1 Sister Marathon when we started late, didn\'t get to Ugly Sister as fast as we would have liked, &amp;amp; decided to rope up for a few pitches (as well as not having a car at the other end of the traverse). Just didn\'t feel like continuing would be worth it. Definitely felt like I\'d accomplished something that day regardless upon getting to the top of Ugly, however.

After approximately 10 miles, turn right on Dutch Johns  Meadow road ( behind the old drive thru wilderness information kiosk ) and follow this rough road ( 4 x 4 or high clearance vehicle  recomended ) for about 6.2 miles. You are passing thru the beautiful Buttermilk Country! Go left at a fork then head up to the McGee  Creek trailhead ( 4 x 4 needed for the last part ). Cross country hike south to the South Fork of McGee Creek and follow this upstream ( west )  to a barren camp below the huge moraine below the Southeast Face of Mount Humphreys.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_2\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Route Description&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;br&gt;This excellent climb begins by trudging up sand slopes that lead up a gully that is right of the Southeast face and the pocket glacier at its base. Before reaching the notch in the East Arete staight up the gully, follow a sandy gully that heads left to a notch higher up on the ridge. One can look down on the glacier from this point. Class 3 and 4 climbing leads up to a vertical step. Improbable 5th class moves lead around the left side to a good ledge. A pitch of 5.2 up cracks leads to a ridgetop. follow the ridge line and turn a big rock on the left, then follow the ridge to the plateau below the summit cone. 5.4 climbing uo the face from the right hand side leads up and left to easier ground and the summit. Down climb and rappel the route.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The East Arete can also be climbed from the glacier on the north side, but i have no first hand knowledge of this variation.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;this climb is one of the \" 100 Classic Climbs of the High Sierra \", and deservedly so!&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;table class=\"inline_image_thumbs\"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=147230\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/147230.JPG\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_3\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Essential Gear&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;br&gt;A rope, and a light rack plus a few slings are all most climbers will need.

However it is also possible to begin the ridge at a saddle east of peak 12,241. The ridge leading to the notch includes some wonderful class 3 and 4 scrambling, goes over (or around) a subpeak (13,000+), and then drops into the notch. There is some interesting downclimbing into this notch. Be prepared for a little 5.8/5.9 downbouldering, some very circuitous downclimbing, or else a short rappel. After the notch is reached, you\'re back on the standard route.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r&lt;br&gt;Peter Croft writes: \"Clyde soloed the route in the summer of \'35, another feather in his cap.

Continue up the crest of the ridge untill you reach a rock wall and pine trees. There should be a passage to your right that drops down towards another gulley.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Traverse the side of the gulley and head up the rock-strewn chute filled with pine trees. Midway up there is a rock wall blocking the route. This can be overcome by scrambling about 10-15 feet up the left side and traversing back over to the chute. At the top of the chute, traverse to the saddle on your left. From here you can see into a couloir that runs diagonally across the north face. (This couloir can also be accessed via North Fork, which empties into Neffs Canyon.)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;From here you hike up the couloir. Partway across the face the couloir opens up and the pathway branches. Take the right route that drops down a little ways into another couloir. Follow this couloir to the prominent skyline of the north face. From here, it is about a 20-30 minute scramble along the top of the ridgeline to reach the summit. Before the summit you will encounter an impassable wall interrupting the ridgeline. Downclimb into the notch below you and continue hiking parallel to the ridgeline until you come to a saddle. From the saddle you can easily find a minor summit to your left looking down the north face. To your right is a class 4 scramble to the north summit.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The summit can also be reached more easily by crossing the gulley you downclimbed into, rather than hiking up it. Scramble below the ridge that makes the southern boundary of the gulley and scramble up the chute that cuts through this ridgeline. The summit block is a giant diamond-shaped rock.

But following Gary Nichols advice in \"Trails of the Wasatch\".  I just started at the Neff\'s Canyon trailhead and went up North\'s Fork, past Olympus Spring, and took the 2nd canyon on the Right (this was tricky, it wasn\'t totally clear what counts as a \"canyon\".  I had to use the map on my phone to judge when I was at the base of the correct slot.)  From there it was just a really fun non-technical hike/climb all the way up.  If indeed the watertower route is blocked by private property, I would propose Neff\'s becomes the \"standard\" route for this hike.  I can\'t figure out how to post a GPX here, but it is on peakbagger at http://www.peakbagger.com/climber/ascent.aspx?aid=580497.&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td valign=\"bottom\" style=\"padding-top: 6px;\" colspan=\"2\"&gt;&lt;span style=\"font-size: 9px; color: #888;\"&gt;Posted Feb 11, 2016 2:53 am&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;table border=\"0\" width=\"775\"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;table cellpadding=\"2\" cellspacing=\"2\" width=\"100%\"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;&lt;span class=\"pagertext\"&gt;Viewing: &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;-&lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt; of &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td align=\"center\"&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td align=\"right\"&gt;    &lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_6\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Images&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div align=\"center\"&gt;&lt;table id=\"my_images\"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/summit-of-the-north-peak-of-mount-olympus/474127/c-157840\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Summit of the North Peak of Mount Olympus\" src=\"/images/square/474127.JPG\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/the-south-side-of-mount/18153/c-157840\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"The south side of Mount...\" src=\"/images/square/18153.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/on-the-north-face-of-mount-olympus/474124/c-157840\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\" On the North Face of Mount Olympus\" src=\"/images/square/474124.JPG\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/looking-down-the-north-face/18154/c-157840\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Looking down the north face...\" src=\"/images/square/18154.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/there-are-only-a-few-sections/18161/c-157840\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"There are only a few sections...\" src=\"/images/square/18161.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/a-view-of-salt-lake-city-from/18156/c-157840\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"A view of Salt Lake City from...\" src=\"/images/square/18156.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/approaching-the-north-face/18157/c-157840\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Approaching the north face\" src=\"/images/square/18157.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/another-approach-shot/18158/c-157840\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Another approach shot\" src=\"/images/square/18158.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/looking-up-the-first-chute/18159/c-157840\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Looking up the first chute...\" src=\"/images/square/18159.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/north-face-couloir/205207/c-157840\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"North Face Couloir\" src=\"/images/square/205207.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/the-north-face/18160/c-157840\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"The north face\" src=\"/images/square/18160.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/the-route-up-the-north-face/18162/c-157840\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"The route up the north face...\" src=\"/images/square/18162.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/north-face-couloir/205209/c-157840\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"North Face Couloir\" src=\"/images/square/205209.JPG\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/bells-canyon-peaks/205214/c-157840\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Bells Canyon Peaks\" src=\"/images/square/205214.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/article&gt;date:'),(187,157850,'/swan-slab/157850','/yosemite-valley-logistical-center/150992','Swan Slab','','','5.1 to 5.11b','','',10094,37.74,-119.58,'California, United States, North America','','',150992,'Yosemite Valley - Logistical Center','','0.8','Bouldering','','Half a day','Route','content: &lt;article&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_1\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2 id=\"first_h2\"&gt;Overview&lt;/h2&gt;Swan Slab is a small climbing area in Yosemite Valley.   Easily accessible and with numerous moderate routes, this is the perfect place to go for some easy cragging with kids or as a warm-up for the harder stuff.    Swan Slab hosts bouldering, top-roping, trad routes, and sport climbs all from 5.1 to 5.11b.   This area is very popular due to easy access and can get very crowded on weekends.   Swan Slab is where the Yosemite Mountaineering School takes students for their beginning rock climbing classes.  This area is very close to the main road and trail, thus gawkers are prevalent.   Expect to have an audience on busy summer days.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_2\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How Do I Get There?&lt;/h2&gt;Swan Slab is located about 350 feet east of Camp 4 (Sunnyside) directly across the road from Yosemite Lodge.   There is a well worn trail which leaves Camp 4 to the east and parallels the main road.    There is a shuttle stop (#7) at Yosemite Lodge across the road from Swan Slab.  You can park in the parking lots in either Yosemite Village or Curry Village and take the shuttle, or park in the Camp 4 or Yosemite Lodge parking lot and walk a short distance.&lt;br&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_3\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Routes Overview&lt;/h2&gt;ï»¿Most of the easier routes are unnamed; however some of the more noteworthy are: Grant&rsquo;s Crack 5.9, Oak Tree Flake 5.6, Swan Slab Gully 5.6, Claudes Delight 5.7, Kokl Duck 5.11a, Lena&rsquo;s Lieback 5.9, Goat For It 5.10a, and Ugly Duckling 5.10c.

Standard rack, top-rope set-ups, sport gear, crash pad.  A helmet is recommended due to all the people and rock fall potential.   Swan slab faces south and can get very hot in the summer, so bring lots of water.   Also, bring a picnic lunch,  lawn chairs, or a blanket.  There is plenty of shade near the slab to enjoy the views, have lunch, or take a break during climbing.&lt;br&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_5\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Images&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div align=\"center\"&gt;&lt;table id=\"my_images\"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/a-bear-inspects-our-toprope-anchor-at-swan-slab/309686/c-157850\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"A bear inspects our toprope anchor at Swan Slab...\" src=\"/images/square/309686.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/jam-practice/242613/c-157850\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Jam Practice\" src=\"/images/square/242613.JPG\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/grant-s-crack/680629/c-157850\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Grant\\\'s Crack\" src=\"/images/square/680629.JPG\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/first-crack/242610/c-157850\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"First crack\" src=\"/images/square/242610.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/oak-tree-flake/680630/c-157850\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Oak Tree Flake\" src=\"/images/square/680630.JPG\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/crack-practice/242617/c-157850\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Crack Practice\" src=\"/images/square/242617.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/oak-tree-flake/247966/c-157850\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Oak Tree Flake\" src=\"/images/square/247966.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/swan-slab-gully/680628/c-157850\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Swan Slab Gully\" src=\"/images/square/680628.JPG\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/swan-slab-chimney/680631/c-157850\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Swan Slab Chimney\" src=\"/images/square/680631.JPG\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/hanging-flake/680632/c-157850\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Hanging Flake\" src=\"/images/square/680632.JPG\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/article&gt;date:'),(188,157862,'/west-slabs-route/157862','/mount-olympus/151263','West Slabs Route','','','III 5.5','','III',19093,40.657,-111.77,'Utah, United States, North America','','',151263,'Mount Olympus','','1.0','Technical Rock Climb','','Half a day','Route','content: &lt;article&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_1\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2 id=\"first_h2\"&gt;Approach&lt;/h2&gt;From Wasatch Blvd., turn east onto Oakview Dr. (4275 South).

The lower pitches \"make\" this route, but the upper pitches have their share of interesting sections as well.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The route can probably be climbed anywhere on the wall and still remain 5.5, but it is best to just start at the lowest part on the wall and weave your way up following the path of least resistance.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A prominant land mark on this route is a giant ledge roughly 350 ft high up the wall with a 2 bolt anchor.  This should be easily recognized to to the fact it is the largest ledge, and had the only bolts we encountered on the climb.   &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Length = 900 feet (give or take)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Descent:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This is the descent listed in \"Rockclimbing Utah\'s Wasatch Range\" by the Ruckmans.  &lt;br&gt;\"The west ridge of the North Face is the best descent route.  A few moves of exposed scrambling are involved near the top of the ridge.  After reaching the shoulder below the West Ridge, either descend down the gully to the west of the ascent gully, or scramble east following the base of the slabs, to reach the start of the climb.  from here, continue back down the ascent gully. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It is also possible to continue along the ridge from the top of the climb to the north summit, and descend via the Kamp\'s ridge descent.  A considerable amount of scrambling is involved this way, not to mention an additional trek through the neighborhood to get back to your car. \"&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;My friend and I descended down the gully to the west of the approach, but that had horrible bushwacking and a nice trip through the city to try and locate are car.

Continue straight through the stoplight and follow the road another 4 miles to the mouth of Little Cottonwood Canyon, where an electronic billboard on the right provides current road and/or weather conditions. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Drive 5.5 miles up Little Cottonwood Canyon (0.7 miles before Snowbird Ski Resort) approximately 30 min from Salt Lake City. There are signs marking the turnoff on the south side of the road for the trailhead parking lot. The turnoff is just past a turn in the road and is easy to miss. The turnoff for the Tanner\'s Flat campground is passed first, and then begin slowing down once you see the \"White Pine Slide Area\" sign.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This trail head services 3 different approaches to the E Ridge. One is the standard hiking trail via Red Pine. Another is a steep scramble or snow climb via Maybird Gulch. Yet another is a speculative route along what I have dubbed the Maybird Palisades. &lt;i&gt;Speculative because I haven\'t climbed it nor have known anyone who has climbed it, but I\'ve scoped it out from both sides and topos and am pointing it out as an interesting possibility.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_2\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;u&gt;Stats from White Pine TH to Summit&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_3\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h4&gt;via Red Pine:&lt;/h4&gt; 4.5 miles, 3,700 ft gain&lt;br&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_4\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h4&gt;via Maybird Palisades:&lt;/h4&gt; ? miles, ?,??? ft gain, ?,???\' loss&lt;br&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_5\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h4&gt;via Maybird Headwall:&lt;/h4&gt; ? miles, ?,??? ft gain, ?,???\' loss&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_6\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;u&gt;Common Approach - White Pine Canyon/Red Pine Canyon Trail Segment&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;(From White Pine TH to Red Pine Trail Junction)&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Distance:&lt;/b&gt; 2.5 miles&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Elevation Gain:&lt;/b&gt; 1,400\' gain&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For all three variations, take the White Pine trail across the river, and follow the old dirt road/trail as it traverses west before arcing up into White Pine Canyon. At the first switchback (1 mile) there is a faint but still well-used trail crossing White Pine Canyon stream. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Take this trail to reach Red Pine Canyon. This trail climbs out of White Pine Canyon and continues traversing west before arcing up Red Pine Canyon. Just as the trail reaches the Red Pine Canyon stream (elev. 9,100\') and the terrain flattens, there is an even more faint trail crossing the stream (2.5 miles). This trail heads into Maybird Gulch. Beware, this turnoff is easy to miss, especially in the winter when the sign and the bridge are covered in snow. From here there are three options to climbing the East Ridge. One is to gain the ridge by climbing the headwall of Maybird Fork, another is to scramble along the ridge dividing Maybird Fork from Red Pine Fork, and the most common way is to head up Red Pine Fork. The respective routes are discussed below.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;noformat&gt;&lt;table&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;div align=\"center\" class=\"image\" style=\"width: 106px;\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"/the-pfiefferhorn-and/19687\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"The Pfiefferhorn and...\" height=\"61\" width=\"100\" src=\"/images/thumb/19687.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=\"caption\"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;div align=\"center\" class=\"image\" style=\"width: 106px;\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"/a-nice-view-of-the/19677\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"A nice view of the...\" height=\"68\" width=\"100\" src=\"/images/thumb/19677.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=\"caption\"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;div align=\"center\" class=\"image\" style=\"width: 73px;\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"/the-pfeifferhorn-as-seen/19680\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"The Pfeifferhorn, as seen...\" height=\"100\" width=\"67\" src=\"/images/thumb/19680.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=\"caption\"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;div align=\"center\" class=\"image\" style=\"width: 106px;\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"/the-pfeifferhorn-as-seen/19682\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"The Pfeifferhorn, as seen...\" height=\"67\" width=\"100\" src=\"/images/thumb/19682.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=\"caption\"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;div align=\"center\" class=\"image\" style=\"width: 106px;\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"/hiking-up-the-southern-side/19683\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Hiking up the southern side...\" height=\"61\" width=\"100\" src=\"/images/thumb/19683.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=\"caption\"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/noformat&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_7\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;u&gt;via Red Pine (cl. 2-3 or 35-40 degree snow)&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;(from Red Pine Trail Junction to Summit)&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Distance:&lt;/b&gt; ? miles &lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Elevation Gain:&lt;/b&gt; ?,???\' gain&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Continue heading up the Red Pine trail until you reach Red Pine Lake,  which is 2.34 miles from the White Pine Trail.  &lt;br&gt;At Red Pine Lake the trail fades, but remains slightly visible for the remainder of the hike. Keep hiking up towards the higher lake.  At that lake a small ridge should be visible projecting out from the southwest end of the canyon headwall (it\'s more apparent closer to the lake).  Scramble up this small ridge to gain the skyline (class 2, moderate snow). This moderate ridge is one of two points along the route prone to avalanche danger and is sometimes corniced at the top. From here it is a relatively flat hike along a more obvious trail towards the east side of the Pfeifferhorn along the divide between Maybird Gulch and Dry Creek Canyon.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It is along this divide that all of the approach variations from the White Pine Trailhead in Little Cottonwood Canyon and the approach from the Dry Creek Trailhead in Alpine converge. The East Ridge proper rises at the end of the flat segment of the divide.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;noformat&gt;&lt;table&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;div align=\"center\" class=\"image\" style=\"width: 70px;\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"/looking-down-the-east-side-of/19676\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Looking down the east side of...\" height=\"100\" width=\"64\" src=\"/images/thumb/19676.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=\"caption\"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;div align=\"center\" class=\"image\" style=\"width: 106px;\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"/the-upper-lake-in-red-pine-fork/19688\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"The upper lake in Red Pine Fork\" height=\"67\" width=\"100\" src=\"/images/thumb/19688.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=\"caption\"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;div align=\"center\" class=\"image\" style=\"width: 72px;\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"/red-pine-lake/19689\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Red Pine Lake\" height=\"100\" width=\"66\" src=\"/images/thumb/19689.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=\"caption\"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;div align=\"center\" class=\"image\" style=\"width: 106px;\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"/the-upper-portion-of-the-red/19678\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"The upper portion of the Red...\" height=\"68\" width=\"100\" src=\"/images/thumb/19678.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=\"caption\"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;div align=\"center\" class=\"image\" style=\"width: 73px;\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"/looking-down-on-the-exposed/19679\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Looking down on the exposed...\" height=\"100\" width=\"67\" src=\"/images/thumb/19679.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=\"caption\"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/noformat&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_8\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;u&gt;via Maybird Headwall/Gulch (cl. 2-3 or 35-40 degree snow)&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;(from Red Pine Trail Junction to Summit))&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Distance:&lt;/b&gt; ? miles &lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Elevation Gain:&lt;/b&gt; ?,???\' gain&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This route involves significant boulder-hopping when snow isn\'t present.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The trail arcs around the rugged ridgeline dividing Red Pine Canyon and Maybird Gulch and heads up the eastern side of the Gulch. From here one is treated with the first views of the Pfeifferhorn. To the right is &lt;a href=\"http://www.summitpost.org/mountains/photo_link.pl/p/photo_id__140933__object_id__13451__type__user__mountain_id____route_id____user_id____order_by____limit__\"&gt;pt. 10,516&lt;/a&gt;, which has a rather interesting summit block spire. To the left is a dramatic rock feature I\'ve dubbed the &lt;a href=\"http://www.summitpost.org/mountains/photo_link.pl/p/photo_id__140956__object_id__13451__type__user__mountain_id____route_id____user_id____order_by____limit__\"&gt;Maybird Palisades&lt;/a&gt;. These offer some possible fun top-roping crack and dihedral climbs. There are three small lakes a little ways off trail to the right (west). These lakes provide your last chance to refill water.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Soon you will reach the open bowl at the top of Maybird Gulch. From here, cross the bowl (a long boulder-hop when there is no snow) and follow the line of least resistance up the steep slope. A more interesting line is to ascend right along the base of the northeast face of the Pfeifferhorn. Once the cirque headwall is gained, scramble directly up the rocky ridge to the summit, or ascend the more moderate trail that switchbacks up a subtle chute to the south (this chute may have some danger of avalanching).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;noformat&gt;&lt;table&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;div align=\"center\" class=\"image\" style=\"width: 106px;\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"/pfeifferhorn-above-maybird/41208\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Pfeifferhorn above Maybird...\" height=\"72\" width=\"100\" src=\"/images/thumb/41208.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=\"caption\"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;div align=\"center\" class=\"image\" style=\"width: 106px;\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"/the-little-matterhorn-from/54337\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"The  Little Matterhorn  from...\" height=\"67\" width=\"100\" src=\"/images/thumb/54337.JPG\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=\"caption\"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;div align=\"center\" class=\"image\" style=\"width: 106px;\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view-from-the-summit-looking/60658\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"View from the summit looking...\" height=\"75\" width=\"100\" src=\"/images/thumb/60658.JPG\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=\"caption\"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;div align=\"center\" class=\"image\" style=\"width: 106px;\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"/trackhead-ascending-the/113106\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Trackhead, ascending the...\" height=\"75\" width=\"100\" src=\"/images/thumb/113106.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=\"caption\"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/noformat&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_9\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;u&gt;via Maybird Palisades (cl. 3-4+? or 35-40 degree snow)&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;(from Red Pine Trail Junction to Summit)&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Distance:&lt;/b&gt; ? miles &lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Elevation Gain:&lt;/b&gt; ?,???\' gain&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This is probably the slowest variation up the Pfeifferhorn, but for the scrambler, it is also probably the most fun. It is also the most safe from avalanching. It has more exposure than the other variations, with a lot of class 3-4 scrambling.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Take the trail described earlier that branches off from Red Pine and heads into Maybird Gulch. As you round the corner to the gulch, pick your way up to the dividing ridge via the easiest line possible. This end of the ridge is fairly moderate.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As you work farther on the ridge, the ridge narrows, with the west side becoming more &lt;a href=\"http://www.summitpost.org/mountains/photo_link.pl/p/photo_id__140956__object_id__13451__type__user__mountain_id____route_id____user_id____order_by____limit__\"&gt;sheer&lt;/a&gt; than the east side. Eventually you will be climbing up and down around many gendarmes, with an exposed dropoff to the west.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Once on the ridge, follow it all the way to pt. 10,897 and follow the cirque headwall of Maybird Gulch via the remainder of the route described in the Red Pine variation.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;WARNING: I have not yet done this ridge, and I haven\'t seen it described in guidebooks. I determined a difficulty range by how it looked from different angles. Until I can climb it to get confirmation, or someone else climbs it who I can talk to, the difficulty ratings might actually be different than what is listed here.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;noformat&gt;&lt;table&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;div align=\"center\" class=\"image\" style=\"width: 106px;\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"/february-26th-2005-the/92491\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"February 26th, 2005 - The...\" height=\"56\" width=\"100\" src=\"/images/thumb/92491.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=\"caption\"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;div align=\"center\" class=\"image\" style=\"width: 106px;\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"/march-12th-2005-the/94920\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"March 12th, 2005 - The...\" height=\"75\" width=\"100\" src=\"/images/thumb/94920.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=\"caption\"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;div align=\"center\" class=\"image\" style=\"width: 106px;\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"/march-12th-2005-joe/94844\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"March 12th, 2005 - Joe...\" height=\"75\" width=\"100\" src=\"/images/thumb/94844.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=\"caption\"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/noformat&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_10\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Approach - Dry Creek TH (Alpine) - ?,???\'&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;font color=\"red\"&gt;Under Construction&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Directions and description coming soon . . .&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_11\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;u&gt;RT Stats from Dry Creek TH to Summit&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Distance:&lt;/b&gt; ? miles&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Elevation Gain:&lt;/b&gt; ?,???\' gain&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;(from Dry Creek Trailhead to Bullion Divide)&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Distance:&lt;/b&gt; ? miles &lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Elevation Gain:&lt;/b&gt; ?,???\' gain&lt;a name=\"chapter_12\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The East Ridge&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;font color=\"red\"&gt;Under Construction&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;(From flat portion of the divide to the summit)&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Distance:&lt;/b&gt; ? miles&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Elevation Gain:&lt;/b&gt; ?,???\'&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Before reaching the peak, the trail becomes more faint again as you scramble along a mildly exposed ridgeline (class 2-3), mostly follwing ledges on the north side of the ridge above Maybird Gulch.

One can also opt for a more direct and steeper line by following the ridgeline straight up to the summit from the lower ridge scramble &lt;i&gt;(safer from avalanches)&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;a name=\"chapter_13\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Essential Gear&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;font color=\"red\"&gt;Under Construction&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;u&gt;Summer:&lt;/u&gt;&lt;br&gt;10 Essentials and good hiking boots.

Follow the trail to Treasure Lakes, however, at 10,400\' (or lower) you\'ll want to get off trail to the right and hike up some slabs and scree over the lower part of Mount Gilbert\'s NW Ridge. This will get you into Gilbert basin from where Gilbert\'s North Couloir is reachable. Continue west Thompsons Northeast Face to climb any of it\'s couloirs or the North Ridge (aka Thompson Ridge).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Doing the approach on the first day and camping below the couloirs is a popular option though it\'s possible to do this in one day from South Lake if you are fast.

Bob Pickering measured the couloir at 600\' with an angle of \"38-54 degrees sustained with one bulge at 60 degrees.\" For the vertical, it depends on where you start measuring which can account for the discrepancy.&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;table class=\"inline_image_thumbs\"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=19704\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/19704.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=19703\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/19703.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=19705\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/19705.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=142411\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/142411.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=142412\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/142412.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_3\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Descent&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;br&gt;The descent has become the crux for some trips because there are no easy walk-offs, at least short ones. Here are several options:&lt;br&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;li&gt;Downclimb: One popular descent for any of Thompson\'s ice couloirs is to downclimb the Harrington Couloir.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;li&gt;Rappel: It\'s possible to rappel using a combination of V-threads, ice bolards, and rock anchors if you don\'t mind leaving some gear.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;li&gt;Thompson Ridge: If you don\'t want to do either of the above, you can descend the class 3 Thompson Ridge, however, this route may be a bit longer than desired and coming off the ridge earlier than the class 3 route means rappeling technical terrain.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;table class=\"inline_image_thumbs\"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=19706\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/19706.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_4\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Essential Gear&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;br&gt;Two ice tools, crampons, and a helmet. If you want to rope up, a few ice screws and nuts are useful. As of October 2002, there was a nut and old pin up on the right side.&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;table class=\"inline_image_thumbs\"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=142413\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/142413.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_5\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Miscellaneous Info&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;br&gt;If you have information about this route that doesn\'t pertain to any of the other sections, please add it here.&lt;br&gt;&lt;div align=\"center\"&gt;&lt;a name=\"messages\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_6\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Additions and Corrections&lt;/h2&gt;[ &lt;a href=\"/object_discussion.php?type=vote_comments&amp;amp;object_id=157970&amp;amp;is_addition=1#vote_form\"&gt;Post an Addition or Correction&lt;/a&gt; ]&lt;table cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" style=\"width: 775px;\"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;table cellpadding=\"2\" cellspacing=\"2\" width=\"100%\"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;&lt;span class=\"pagertext\"&gt;Viewing: &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;-&lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt; of &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td align=\"center\"&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td align=\"right\"&gt;    &lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;table border=\"0\" width=\"775\" class=\"messages\"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td width=\"110\" align=\"left\" valign=\"top\" style=\"padding-top: 6px;\"&gt;&lt;a name=\"109245\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a class=\"dis_user_lnk\" href=\"/users/pellucidwombat/12893\"&gt;PellucidWombat&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td valign=\"top\" style=\"padding-top: 6px;\"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Route Comment&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td align=\"right\" valign=\"top\" nowrap style=\"font-size: 10px;\"&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td valign=\"top\" rowspan=\"2\" align=\"left\" style=\"padding-top: 6px;\"&gt;&lt;p class=\"disc_avatar\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"/users/pellucidwombat/12893\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"PellucidWombat\" width=\"50\" height=\"50\" border=\"0\" src=\"/images/avatars/833128.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=\"font-size: 9px; color: #888;\"&gt;Hasn\'t voted&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td colspan=\"2\" style=\"padding-top: 6px;\"&gt;We rapped the couloir on September 25th, 2005 and here\'s what we found (directions described based on looking DOWN the couloir):&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r&lt;br&gt;Rappel 1: There is a broad flat-faced boulder/rock to the right with a ledge system on it. If you stand on the ledge you can reach rapp slings for the second rappel.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r&lt;br&gt;Rappel 2: Angle left toward the opposite side of the couloir. Here there are some more rapp slings and some sloping loose ledges holding snow. As an alternative, there is an old cam left in a crack beneath these ledges where a nicer snow platform can be ade.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r&lt;br&gt;Rappel 3: Stay to the left side of the couloir, and another set of rapp slings can be found alongside the moat - we had to chop steps here to fit everyone (5 people!)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r&lt;br&gt;Rappel 4: Keep to the left and you will come across one more rapp anchor. It is hard to see until you are below it. There was a large bridged moat between us and the wall with anchors. The anchor is composed of one nut in a vertical crack, one chock-pebble girth-hitched in the same crack, and our added sling across a large detached flake beneath the crack.  This rappel conveniently gets you to the bergschrund.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r&lt;br&gt;We needed the full 200ft rope length to reach these anchors. If you\'re climbing with one 60m rope, it will not reach unless you are using a retrieval line!&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td valign=\"bottom\" style=\"padding-top: 6px;\" colspan=\"2\"&gt;&lt;span style=\"font-size: 9px; color: #888;\"&gt;Posted Dec 26, 2005 12:49 am&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;table border=\"0\" width=\"775\"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;table cellpadding=\"2\" cellspacing=\"2\" width=\"100%\"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;&lt;span class=\"pagertext\"&gt;Viewing: &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;-&lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt; of &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td align=\"center\"&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td align=\"right\"&gt;    &lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_7\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Images&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div align=\"center\"&gt;&lt;table id=\"my_images\"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/the-knudtson-smrz-and/19707/c-157970\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"The Knudtson, Smrz, and...\" src=\"/images/square/19707.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/september-25th-2005-miguel/142412/c-157970\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"September 25th, 2005 - Miguel...\" src=\"/images/square/142412.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/september-25th-2005-the/142413/c-157970\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"September 25th, 2005 - The...\" src=\"/images/square/142413.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/september-25th-2005/142411/c-157970\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"September 25th, 2005 -...\" src=\"/images/square/142411.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/michael-and-miguel-at-one-of/144551/c-157970\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\" Michael and Miguel at one of...\" src=\"/images/square/144551.JPG\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/don-as-we-head-up-the/19703/c-157970\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\" Don as we head up the...\" src=\"/images/square/19703.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/don-heading-up-the-lower/19704/c-157970\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\" Don heading up the lower...\" src=\"/images/square/19704.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/our-second-rappel-out-of-the/19706/c-157970\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Our second rappel out of the...\" src=\"/images/square/19706.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/the-upper-portion-of-the/19705/c-157970\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"The upper portion of the...\" src=\"/images/square/19705.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/article&gt;date:');

From the small tree, head diagonally up to the right, aiming for a larger tree on a good ledge. This section is the start of the class 3 friction - if it bothers you climbing moderate granite slopes without handholds you may want to turn back now. If you make it to the big tree without much trouble, you\'ll probably enjoy the rest of the route.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;From the large tree, continue diagonally up to the right into the center of the South Slope. The easiest route trends up to the east (right), the more challenging route trends west (left). There is no one (or two or three) fixed routes, as one can choose many variations on this face. And route-finding is part of the fun. The friction is very good on most of the slopes which allow scrambling on steeper slopes than one might first expect. In fact you can head almost straight up if you like, or aim for ledges and lower-angled slopes as suites your comfort level. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The summit you see up and to the left is a false summit, but has good views and makes a fine target to aim for. The true summit is further to the northeast, a few hundred yards further, and about 100 feet higher up.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;To descend, either head back down the South Slope (shortest route back), or if you\'ve had enough spice for one day, head east down the East Slope. You can pick up the trail to the northeast between the summit and a lower summit to the north. Usually it\'s just a matter of following the regular crowd back down to the trail.&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;table class=\"inline_image_thumbs\"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=22416\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/22416.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=24389\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/24389.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_3\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Essential Gear&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;br&gt;None needed, but wear rock shoes if uncomfortable on class 3 slabs.&lt;br&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_4\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Miscellaneous Info&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;br&gt;If you have information about this route that doesn\'t pertain to any of the other sections, please add it here.&lt;br&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_5\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Images&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div align=\"center\"&gt;&lt;table id=\"my_images\"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/lembert-dome-s-south-slope/22416/c-158258\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Lembert Dome\\\'s South Slope ....\" src=\"/images/square/22416.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/kiwifzzz-is-climbing-class/24389/c-158258\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\" kiwifzzz is climbing Class...\" src=\"/images/square/24389.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/etsuko-is-resting-on-the/24583/c-158258\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Etsuko is resting on the...\" src=\"/images/square/24583.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/article&gt;date:'),(194,158280,'/ne-couloir/158280','/mount-powell/151681','NE Couloir','','','Class 2-3','','',2808,37.1408,-118.624,'California, United States, North America','','',151681,'Mount Powell','','0.8','Snow climb','','One to two days','Route','content: &lt;article&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_1\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2 id=\"first_h2\"&gt;Approach&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;br&gt;Follow the Sabrina basin trail from the dam at Lake Sabrina (9,128\') and follow it to Blue Lake. At Blue Lake, keep heading south towards Baboon Lakes. The trail can be difficult to follow through here, and kind of disappears 400 feet below Baboon Lakes. Just keep aiming up to the obvious bench that holds the lakes. Skirt the Baboon Lakes on the east side and follow the inlet stream up towards Sunset Lake. If you are camping, Baboon and Sunset Lakes are nice spots. If you are not camping at Sunset Lake, then do not follow the stream up to the lake. Instead, follow the right hand fork of this stream when it branches just above Baboon Lakes and follow it up to the saddle NW of Sunset Lake (between Peak 12,486\' and unnamed point 11,680\'+). &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Contour above the NW shore of Sunset Lake and aim for the snowfield on the other side of the lake. The route should be obvious from here up to the Thompson Glacier. Once at the moraine, you will see Thompson on the left and Point Powell on the right.

Enjoy the view.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The chute averages about 42 degrees (38-ish at the bottom, 45-ish at the top).  In late spring/early summer, the top 1/3 of the coulior may be melted out, revealing loose rock underneath.  This is tedious to climb, and can be dangerous with a larger party as rockfall is a serious hazard.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The couloir would make for an incredible ski descent in mid-spring (after the road opens up to Sabrina, but before the snow melts out too much)&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;table class=\"inline_image_thumbs\"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=22743\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/22743.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=22742\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/22742.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=22741\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/22741.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_3\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Essential Gear&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;br&gt;Ice axe, crampons.

The route can also be done from the vicinity of Big Pete Meadow/LeConte Canyon in Kings Canyon NP.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Follow the Sabrina basin trail from the dam at Lake Sabrina (9,128\') and follow it to Blue Lake. At Blue Lake, keep heading south towards Baboon Lakes. The trail can be difficult to follow through here, and kind of disappears 400 feet below Baboon Lakes.

The route should be obvious from here up to the Thompson Glacier. Once at the moraine, you will see Thompson on the left and Point Powell on the right. In between are two broad chutes, and a very steep and long couloir on the right. The couloir is the NE couloir of Point Powell and leads to the summit plateau of that peak. The middle (higher) chute is the Thompson-Powell Col.  &lt;a href=\"http://www.summitpost.com/mountains/photo_link.pl?photo_id=48462&amp;amp;object_id=1836&amp;amp;type=mountain&amp;amp;mountain_id=1836&amp;amp;route_id=1768\"&gt;This photo&lt;/a&gt; paints a good picture of where you need to go.  You\'ll be lucky if you are here in the early season when snow reaches to the top. Otherwise, the top part of the route to the col is filled with nasty scree and loose rock.&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://www.summitpost.com/mountains/photo_link.pl?photo_id=48462&amp;amp;object_id=1836&amp;amp;type=mountain&amp;amp;mountain_id=1836&amp;amp;route_id=1768\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"http://www.summitpost.com/images/thumb/22845.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_2\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Route Description&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;br&gt;From the Thompson-Powell Col, your goal is to wrap around the backside of the prominent rock buttress that separates the Col from the NE Couloir of Point Powell, and then climb up to the broad summit plateau.   Head to climber\'s right from the col, descending slightly where necessary, and aim for an obvious chute leading up to the summit plateau.  The plateau forms a big triangle with Point Powell, Point Wesley and unnamed Peak 13,200\'+ on the corners.  Either peak is easily bagged from here.  For Point Powell, head climbers right to the flattish summit ridge.  Some small class 3 blocks guard the summit, but are easily climbed.  The views from the summit plateau (and the summit proper) are outstanding.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_3\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Essential Gear&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;br&gt;Ice axe and crampons are nice for the steep ascent to the glacier and up Thompson Powell Col.

Turn right after two iles onto the Rafferty Creek Trail, and take this to Tuolumne Pass and Vogelsang HS Camp (8mi from TH). Then follow the trail to Vogelsang Pass that goes through the hanging valley between Fletcher and Vogelsang Peaks.&lt;br&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_2\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Route Description&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;br&gt;There are many routes possible on the East Face of Vogelsang. Several are described here. Refer to the accompanying photo for locations of each route.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Central Face&lt;/b&gt; &lt;i&gt;Class 2&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;This is probably the easiest route to the summit. From below, near the outlet of Vogelsang Lake, A wide opening in the jagged North Ridge appears to offer a direct route to the summit. The rib separating the East Face tops out at a false summit northeast of the true summit. Follow scree and sandy benches to the North Ridge on the right side of the rib, then follow the ridge up to the summit. The climbing is much easier than it appears from below.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Central Bypass&lt;/b&gt; &lt;i&gt;Class 3&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;This is a variation on the Central Face. Aim for the rib on the left side, and pass over the center ridge at where the ridge is marked with orange-colored rock. Follow a left-leaning diagonal line marked with small shrubs up about 70 feet, then head directly up by any of numerous variations. The rock here is enjoyable class 3.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Left-side Gully&lt;/b&gt; &lt;i&gt;Class 2&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;Just before reaching Vogelsang Pass, head west up a wide side canyon that heads towards the summit. At the end of the side canyon turn left and climb the gully heading up to the Southeast Ridge. The southwest side of the ridge is easy class 2 to the summit. Through early summer this gully is snow-filled and makes a great glissade. I use trail goes up the gully after the snow melts.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Central Direct&lt;/b&gt; &lt;i&gt;Class 3 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;Class 3 variations can be found along the steep portion of the East Face just left of the summit. From a point below the summit, angle up and left over solid class 3 rock. Aim for a point on the Southeast Ridge about 1/4 of the way from the summit towards the Left-side Gully. This route looks like an impossible scramble from below, but a good series of benches makes this an enjoyable rock scramble.&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;table class=\"inline_image_thumbs\"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=23418\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/23418.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=23463\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/23463.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_3\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Essential Gear&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;br&gt;Axe and crampons useful in early season, otherwise none needed from mid-summer through fall.&lt;br&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_4\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Miscellaneous Info&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;br&gt;If you have information about this route that doesn\'t pertain to any of the other sections, please add it here.&lt;br&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_5\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Images&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div align=\"center\"&gt;&lt;table id=\"my_images\"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/vogelsang-s-east-face-with/23418/c-158350\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Vogelsang\\\'s East Face with...\" src=\"/images/square/23418.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/vogelsang-s-east-face-routes/23463/c-158350\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Vogelsang\\\'s East Face routes...\" src=\"/images/square/23463.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/article&gt;date:'),(197,158564,'/nw-buttress/158564','/tenaya-peak/151779','NW Buttress','','','5.5','','',9123,37.8286,-119.442,'California, United States, North America','','',151779,'Tenaya Peak','','1.0','Technical Rock Climb','','Most of a day','Route','content: &lt;article&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_1\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2 id=\"first_h2\"&gt;Approach&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;br&gt;Start from the parking lot just east of Tenaya Lake. Head south through the forest, across the meadow and stream, and climb the slabby bushwhack to the left (east of the NW Buttress). There are faint use trails that can save much of the bushwhack if you take the time to look for them. If you head for the toe of the buttress you will have significantly less bushwhacking. If you either enjoy a good, steep bushwhack, or like us don\'t know when to quit thrashing, you can bushwhack all the way to the morraine that you will find in the hanging valley east of the buttress halfway up the buttress. It\'s then an easy traverse over to the buttress.&lt;br&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_2\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Route Description&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;br&gt;The lower half of the NW Buttress is easy, low-angle slab climbing.

The climbing is highly enjoyable, on clean granite slabs. Follow any of several logical crack systems on your way up.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A few hundred feet from the top there is a sloping roof consisting of overlapping slabs to be avoided on the left side. Head to the right of this, then angle back to the left above for the easiest exit. Exiting further to the right is more like class 5.7-8.&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;table class=\"inline_image_thumbs\"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=25807\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/25807.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=57991\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/57991.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=25810\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/25810.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=57987\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/57987.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=57988\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/57988.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_3\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Essential Gear&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;br&gt;We had rock shoes, a 37m rope, and rack consisting of 5 cams, some slings and carabiners.

The class 3 section is all slab climbing, not too long, and ideal for an introduction to steeper slab soloing. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;From the west side of Tenya Lake, head south along the trail. The most difficult challenge of the approach is the initial stream crossing. Leave the trail and climb the rounded granite dome on the lower portion of the SW Ridge. Climb over and onto the south side, then head east up the drainage to the small saddle found between the rounded dome and the SW Ridge proper.&lt;br&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_2\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Route Description&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;br&gt;The most aesthetic and exciting part of the route is the few hundred feet of clean granite slabs that rise immediately above the saddle. There are plenty of cracks and ledges to guide you up the slabs. Don\'t forget to enjoy the views along the way.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Continue following the SW Ridge until you reach the top of the &lt;a href=\"http://www.summitpost.com/show/route_link.pl/route_id/1946/object_id/2140\"&gt;West Face&lt;/a&gt; Route. Above this point the ridge is more blocky and more of an arete, making it difficult to follow (with much up and down). There is a faint use trail that can be found at the top of the West Face route that takes you to the south side of the ridge and on up to the summit. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;You can descend the same way or hike down to Mildred Lake and follow the drainage back out around the south side of the SW Ridge. Stay right (north) of the drainage for the easiest (and shortest) way back. Many climbers make the mistake of trying to hike out to the Sunrise Trail to take that back to Tenaya Lake. The cross-country travel is easy and enjoyable here, and there is no need to hike that far west to get back. Simply follow the contours around to the north.&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;table class=\"inline_image_thumbs\"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=25846\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/25846.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_3\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Essential Gear&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;br&gt;None needed.&lt;br&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_4\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Miscellaneous Info&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;br&gt;If you have information about this route that doesn\'t pertain to any of the other sections, please add it here.&lt;br&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_5\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Images&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div align=\"center\"&gt;&lt;table id=\"my_images\"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/the-sw-ridge-of-tenaya-peak/25846/c-158576\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"The SW Ridge of Tenaya Peak....\" src=\"/images/square/25846.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/article&gt;date:'),(199,158716,'/south-slope-via-royce-merriam-saddle/158716','/royce-peak/151712','South slope via Royce/Merriam saddle','','','Class 2','','',3186,37.3189,-118.77,'California, United States, North America','','',151712,'Royce Peak','','0.6923076923076923','Scramble','','Less than two hours','Route','content: &lt;article&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_1\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2 id=\"first_h2\"&gt;Approach&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;br&gt;The base of the climb can be reached either from the Merriam Lakes basin to the west or the Royce Lakes to the east.  Both approaches require several days of hiking from either the North Lake trailhead or the Pine Creek Pack Station.  North Lake can be reached by following highway 168 just West from just South of Bishop. From the trailhead follow the Puite Canyon trail until you can turn up the French Canyon trail, which leads to both approaches. The Pine Creek Pack Station can be reached from a road found between Bishop and Rock Creek.  From the trailhead hike up over Pine Creek Pass and either to the Royce Lakes or down into French Canyon to Merriam Lake.&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;table class=\"inline_image_thumbs\"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=23838\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/23838.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=39575\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/39575.JPG\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_2\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Route Description&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;br&gt;The saddle between Merriam and Royce Peak can be reached either by climbing a very easy gradual slope from the Merriam Lake side(west) or by the permanent glacier on the Royce Lakes side.  In mid to late season one can skirt the right(North) side of the snow field and ascend the saddle without an axe or crampons.  Once on the saddle scramble up the slope either via some nice Class 2-3 rocks or follow one of the semi-worn gravel trails that winds its way(off and on) to the summit.  The middle of the three piles of rocks on the summit plateau is the actual summit.  All three can be climbed, though the far summit requires some Class 3 moves.&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;table class=\"inline_image_thumbs\"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=23837\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/23837.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=23839\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/23839.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_3\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Essential Gear&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;br&gt;In early summer and springtime ice axes and crampons may be required to climb the route from Royce Lakes.

The main, lower chute forks and there is an alternative left (north) option, and from the Y you cannot see which one is correct. It is the right (south) one, the one having red rock on the top.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The left one ends just below the summit in some class 3.

The Muldrow Glacier route on the north side of the mountain is just as technically demanding, but does not have an option of flying into a base camp, making the approach very long.  Barry Bishop, Bill Hackett, Bradford Washburn, Henry Buchtel, Jerry More, Jim Gale &amp;amp; Mel Griffiths first climbed Denali&rsquo;s West Buttress in 1951.  Today, over 90% of climbers attempting Denali climb the West Buttress.  On average, out of the 1000 people attempting the West Buttress annually, only about 50% are successful, 100 acquire altitude sickness or frostbite and 12 rescues are made.  About 40 people have died on the West Buttress.  Do not underestimate this route despite its non-technical nature.&lt;center&gt;&lt;div align=\"center\" class=\"image-left\" style=\"width: 950px;\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://www.summitpost.org/denali-s-west-buttress/840288/c-159690\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"http://images.summitpost.org/original/840288.jpg\" alt=\"\" style=\"width: 944px; height: 640px;\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=\"caption\"&gt;Brian Kalet on the West Buttress at about 17,000\'.

Sometimes camps are established at 12,500\' and 16,000\', but these locations are not recommended since the camp at 12,500\' is located in an avalanche runout zone and the campsite at 16,000 is generally very windy.  Ranger stations are established at 7,200\' and 14,200\' during the general climbing season, which is early May through early July.  To ensure success, you should allow for three weeks on the mountain.  Most climbers fail because bad weather prevents them from summiting and they simply run out of time.&lt;/center&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_2\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Getting There&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div&gt;Basecamp is at 7,200 feet on the southeast fork of the Kahiltna Glacier.  The easiest way to get to the basecamp is via air taxi from Talkeetna, Alaska and the most logical way to get to Talkeetna if travelling from out of state is via Anchorage, Alaska.  Transportation from Anchorage International Airport to Talkeetna costs $75-290 one way and is usually done using a shuttle service.  Transportation from Talkeetna to basecamp via air taxi generally costs $400-500 roundtrip.  Larger groups and early reservations save money.&lt;hr&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;u&gt;Shuttle Services&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;1. &lt;a href=\"http://www.talkeetnatravel.com/talkeetna_transportation.php\"&gt;Talkeetna Travel&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;2. &lt;a href=\"http://talkeetnataxi.com/2011/01/our-rates/\"&gt;Talkeetna Taxi&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;3. &lt;a href=\"http://www.denalioverland.com/\"&gt;Denali Overland Transportation Company&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;4. &lt;a href=\"http://www.talkeetnatransportation.info/\"&gt;Alaska Transportation&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;u&gt;Air Taxi Operators&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;1. &lt;a href=\"http://www.talkeetnaair.com/\"&gt;Talkeetna Air Taxi&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;2. &lt;a href=\"http://www.katair.com/\"&gt;Kantishna Air Taxi&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;3. &lt;a href=\"http://www.flydenali.com/\"&gt;Fly Denali, Inc.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;div align=\"center\" class=\"image\" style=\"width: 950px;\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://www.summitpost.org/denali-s-west-buttress/303385/c-159690\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"http://images.summitpost.org/original/303385.jpg\" alt=\"\" style=\"width: 944px; height: 795px;\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=\"caption\"&gt;Denali\'s West Buttress Route&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_3\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Route Description&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Basecamp to 7,800&rsquo;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Distance:&lt;/b&gt; 5.5 miles&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Elevation Gain:&lt;/b&gt; 1,000&rsquo;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Elevation Loss:&lt;/b&gt; 400&rsquo;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Descend Heartbreak Hill and ascend the main Kahiltna Glacier to 7,800&rsquo;.

Climb the headwall and gain the West Buttress.  This is the steepest section &amp;amp; the crux of the entire route.  Use of an ascender will assist the climb, but is not necessary.

Skiing from the summit is uncommon today, but many climbers use skis on the lower glacier and cache them at 11,000&rsquo; or 14,200&rsquo;.  If you do plan to ski from the summit, expect difficult snow.&lt;a name=\"chapter_5\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;When to Climb&lt;/h2&gt;Teams usually plan their expeditions on the West Buttress from early May-early July.  That being said, Denali has been climbed via its West Buttress in winter and was first done so by Art Davidson, Dave Johnston, and Ray Genet  in 1967.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Attempting Denali via the West Buttress any later than early July is not advised because landing a bush plane on the southeast fork of the Kahliltna Galcier becomes too dangerous.  The weather is typically more stable in May, but colder.  And vice versa, the weather is typically warmer in June and July, but typically less stable.  Also later in the season, the crevasses are much more exposed, especially on the lower part of the mountain.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_6\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Essential Gear&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;div align=\"center\" class=\"image-right\" style=\"width: 706px;\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://www.summitpost.org/denali-s-summit-ridge/423788/c-159690\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"http://images.summitpost.org/original/423788.jpg\" alt=\"\" style=\"width: 700px; height: 525px;\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=\"caption\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://www.summitpost.org/users/alpinist/16167\"&gt;Alpinist&lt;/a&gt; on the summit ridge.

The cost of registration is $350 for climbers over 24 years of age and $250 for climbers 24 and younger.  In addition, a Denali National Park entrance fee of $10 is required.  You will be provided with a clean mountain can (CMC) where you will store your solid human waste when you are not close to an appropriate location to dispose of it.  You can dispose of your waste in biodegradable bags in deep crevasses away from the route or at basecamp and 14,200\' camp where there are established outhouses.  You are required to return your CMC to the Talkeetna Ranger Station after your climb.&lt;a name=\"chapter_8\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Speed Records&lt;/h2&gt;The current speed record for the West Buttress route was done by &lt;a href=\"http://verticalminded.com/denali-speed-ascent-2\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://verticalminded.com/denali-speed-ascent-2/\"&gt;Ed Warren&lt;/a&gt; on May 31, 2013 in 16 hours and 46 minutes roundtrip.

color: #888;\"&gt;Hasn\'t voted&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td colspan=\"2\" style=\"padding-top: 6px;\"&gt;The part from Basin camp to the notch at 16,200 (the top of the Headwall) is the steepest part of the entire climb. Supposedly up to 55 degrees slope. There are fixed lines so bring an ascender if you have one. If not, you can still cliimb the Headwall no problem. During our first carry to 17,200 (High camp), there was a traffic jam on the fixed lines so I just climbed around the people for a good portion of the section - perfectly doable if you are confident with ice ax and crampons and use both your legs and hands... &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r&lt;br&gt;Once at the notch, there is a ridge (called 16 Ridge) to your right leading to the small basin at 17,200 where the High Camp is located. This is probably most spectacular and technically most dificult part of the entire climb (still not technically demanding). There were fixed lines around Washburn Thumb (approx. in the middle of the ridge). The ridge is almost always at least couple feet wide so you get good footing, although the exposure on both sides is big - couple thousand feet. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r&lt;br&gt;At High camp (17,200), you have to use CMS cans to go to bathroom (I believe mandatory from 2004 season) - I praise NPS for enforcing that - when digging campsite we uncovered too many frozen feces from previous seasons. There is no ranger station here, NPS only stores rescue gear in a box at the top of the Rescue Gully here (we have witnessed this gear being used in getting a frostbitten climber down to Basin Camp for evacuation). Finding clean snow for melting water at this campsite was a challenge. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r&lt;br&gt;Summit day: From High camp ascend to Denali Pass at approx. 18,200. The route is pretty straightforward, you just traverse the slope. Be ready to self-arrest if you slip, the slope is a long one. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r&lt;br&gt;From Denali Pass continue below a ridge (usually marked with wands) to Football Field at approx. 19,500. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r&lt;br&gt;Once you cross the Football Field, you ascend the \"summit headwall\" which feels quite steep at this altitude to gain the summit ridge. Again, be ready to self arrest when ascending this \"headwall\". I have observed guided trips using running protection on this section. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r&lt;br&gt;In decent weather, views from the ridge are awesome. There is quite an exposure to the right of the ridge (direction when ascending). The ridge gains approx. 300 vertical feet and will take an average person 30 - 45 minutes to climb. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r&lt;br&gt;Then you are there. The summit is nothing spectacular, just a broad mountain top. No summit register either - :-))) There is a USGS marker - take a picture of it in case you need a proof you have made it to the top... &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r&lt;br&gt;Roundtrip from High camp takes an average climber between 9 to 14 hours. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r&lt;br&gt;I highly recommend Colby Combs \"Guide to West Butt\" if you are thinking about this route.&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td valign=\"bottom\" style=\"padding-top: 6px;\" colspan=\"2\"&gt;&lt;span style=\"font-size: 9px; color: #888;\"&gt;Posted Jun 5, 2004 3:20 pm&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;table border=\"0\" width=\"745\" class=\"messages\" style=\"margin-left: 30px;\"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td rowspan=\"4\" valign=\"top\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/styles/layout/reply_arrow.gif\"&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td width=\"110\" align=\"left\" valign=\"top\" style=\"padding-top: 6px;\"&gt;&lt;a name=\"471341\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a class=\"dis_user_lnk\" href=\"/users/chickentikka/103032\"&gt;chickentikka&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td valign=\"top\" style=\"padding-top: 6px;\"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Re: Route Comment&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td align=\"right\" valign=\"top\" nowrap style=\"font-size: 10px;\"&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td valign=\"top\" rowspan=\"2\" align=\"left\" style=\"padding-top: 6px;\"&gt;&lt;p class=\"disc_avatar\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"/users/chickentikka/103032\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"chickentikka\" width=\"50\" height=\"50\" border=\"0\" src=\"/images/avatars/842339.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=\"font-size: 9px; color: #888;\"&gt;Hasn\'t voted&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td colspan=\"2\" style=\"padding-top: 6px;\"&gt;Thanks for taking the time to write that!&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td valign=\"bottom\" style=\"padding-top: 6px;\" colspan=\"2\"&gt;&lt;span style=\"font-size: 9px; color: #888;\"&gt;Posted May 28, 2013 7:49 am&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;table border=\"0\" width=\"775\" class=\"messages\"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td width=\"110\" align=\"left\" valign=\"top\" style=\"padding-top: 6px;\"&gt;&lt;a name=\"485192\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a class=\"dis_user_lnk\" href=\"/users/kresser/113258\"&gt;Kresser&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td valign=\"top\" style=\"padding-top: 6px;\"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Air Taxi Service&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td align=\"right\" valign=\"top\" nowrap style=\"font-size: 10px;\"&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td valign=\"top\" rowspan=\"2\" align=\"left\" style=\"padding-top: 6px;\"&gt;&lt;p class=\"disc_avatar\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"/users/kresser/113258\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Kresser\" width=\"50\" height=\"50\" border=\"0\" src=\"/images/avatars/905746.JPG\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=\"font-size: 9px; color: #888;\"&gt;Hasn\'t voted&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td colspan=\"2\" style=\"padding-top: 6px;\"&gt;Our party used Sheldon Air Service to fly in to Base Camp this past June, of 2014.

Besides the flight, Sheldon let our party sleep at their hanger, fed us a meal, lent us bicycles to ride into town, and let us lay all of our gear out in their front yard to dry out upon return.

This eventually runs into SR 89 before one encounters the national park entrance and visitor center.  The road beyond here is closed.   Follow the remaining paved and unblockaded roads beyond the park entrance to the waterfront of Manzanita Lake. Park here and begin hiking on the road.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Distance: 4 miles&lt;br&gt;Elevation Gained: 1200 ft&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Walk back to the main road and continue hiking on SR 89 beyond its closed point.  After about 3/4 mile one will encounter the Chaos Jumbles, which is a large clearing in the forest that starts at the Chaos Crags and cuts downhill past the road.  Hike up this clearing until the small bowl at the base of the Chaos Crags are reached.  Form here, hike up the souther ridgeline about 200 vertical feet before traversing to che right.  Beware- if one goes too high, the terrain to be traversed becomes quite steep and harder to travel across.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The traverse will lead to a long clearing along the base of the cliffs of the Chaos Crags. The ground is flat on the far west side of the clearing.  Walk up the clearing as it dips slightly and then begins gaining elevation as it curves to the left.  Once a steep terminating headwall along the arcing clearing can be seen, begin heading into the sparse forest heading directly towards Lassen Peak, which by now should be in sight.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The clusters of pine trees between this long clearing and the tree line provide good terrain for camping, with many fairly flat spaces.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When doing this route I took a different return route that saved me some elevation gain and an extra mile.  When returning along the long open clearing at the bottom of the Chaos Crags, a low hill will rise to the left.  As this hill disappears, arc to the left.  Keep heading in whatever direction has the most downhill element.  Go down the hill, which starts out mild and becomes steeper until Manzanita Creek is reached.  From here walk parallel to the creek all the way back to the road!  Stay a little above the creek to be on faltter more open terrain, although the terrain becomes more steep and some mild bushwacking is encountered during the last quarter mile.&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;table class=\"inline_image_thumbs\"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=46370\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/46370.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=46149\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/46149.JPG\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=46351\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/46351.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=46146\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/46146.JPG\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=46147\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/46147.JPG\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_2\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Route Description&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;br&gt;Distance:  1.8 miles&lt;br&gt;Elevation: 3,346\'&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Continue heading straight towards the peak and some more long clearings will be encountered.  Up on the peak one can see a series of cliffs clustered together - head just left of the center of these.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Once treeline is reached, continue up the steep ridgeline that is on the left side of some cliffs.  The hiking here is steep and exceeds 40 degrees, but is probably less than 45 degrees.  Eventally the top the first ridge is gained.  From here two large openings can be seen in the cliffs above. Head along the ridgeline towards the right opening.  This right openeing is further divided into to smaller passages by a comparatively small cluster of rocks.  When I did this climb (March 2004), I saw what appeared to be a cornice blocking the right opening.  It seemed that any debris from there would be funneled down and to the left of the ridgeline, keeping most of the route safe.  &lt;br&gt;As the large rightmost cliff wall is approached (which is easily discerned due to its large gendarme), traverse off of the ridge to the left across the chut to a series of small rocks below the small openeing in the cliffs above and to the left.  Form there follow this smaller ridgeline over the horizon.  &lt;br&gt;Beyond the cliffs one can see the edge of the crater bowl about 1,100 feet above.  Continue hiking up this steep slope straight up to the skyline.  The ridgeline gained is the North Ridge.  Follow this ridge to the right, and it then turns left and descends into the summit crater.  Cross the bottom of this crater, winding around the spring rock formations, and then scramble straight up the last  100\' to the summit!&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;table class=\"inline_image_thumbs\"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=46365\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/46365.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=46352\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/46352.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=46353\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/46353.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=46354\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/46354.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=46357\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/46357.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_3\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Essential Gear&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;br&gt;Snowshoes, crampons, an ice axe, and avalanche rescue gear are a must in addition to typical winter camping gear for snow ascents.&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;table class=\"inline_image_thumbs\"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=46360\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/46360.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=46355\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/46355.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=46356\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/46356.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=46358\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/46358.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=46359\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/46359.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_4\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Miscellaneous Info&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;br&gt;If you have information about this route that doesn\'t pertain to any of the other sections, please add it here.&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;table class=\"inline_image_thumbs\"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=46371\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/46371.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=46362\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/46362.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=46368\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/46368.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=46367\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/46367.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=46369\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/46369.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_5\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Images&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div align=\"center\"&gt;&lt;table id=\"my_images\"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/march-2004-the-gendarme/46365/c-160454\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"March 2004 -

Good campsites can be found a bit lower and south of the crest of Thunderbolt Pass. &lt;br&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_2\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Route Description&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;br&gt;The West Face of North Pal has three prominent chutes.  The large talus fan at the rightmost of the three chutes in a white section of rock mark the correct chute.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Climb the chute to the U Notch.  I say this because even though you don\'t actually stand in the notch itself, you are so close you will feel you were there. This will also prevent you taking a wrong ledge.  The climb starts no more than 40-50 vertical feet below the Notch.  The climb starts in a class three open book slot leading to a ledge.  The slot is perhaps 15-20 feet at most and is not difficult.  At the top of the slot is a platform, which becomes a ledge and moves left around a corner to the north.   Round the corner and then climb straight up for at least two full pitches.  The hardest moves are just around the corner from the first ledge.  The target at this point is the extreme right hand edge of the ridge visible above you.  Reaching the top of the ridge on the right you will find a few rappel slings.  This marks the end of the face you\'ve been climbing.  Carefully climb over the ridge to the east side.  The exposure is noteworthy.  Once on the east side, work north and then cross the ridge again to the west moving into the bowl just below the summit.  At this point, take your pick.  You\'ve made it this far.  You\'ll figure the rest out.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;table class=\"inline_image_thumbs\"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=49534\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/49534.JPG\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_3\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Essential Gear&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;br&gt;A few cams may be desired for protection in some areas.

It is easy to get to it, features excellent rock and various types of climbing (face and crack). However, one should consider Tuolumne ratings with a grain of salt. Even though this climb is not considered as a runout in guidebooks, it has spots with either no pro at all or with a 60-80\' fall potential. These runout sections are relatively easy but can become death traps if you attempt to climb this dome in the rain.&lt;br&gt;This route can be climbed in five or six pitches, depending on the rope length and your level of comfort.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Pitch 1&lt;/b&gt; (5.2, 150\'): There is no pro on this pitch aside from the top anchor, so you have to be prepared to free-solo it. It is helpful to locate anchor bolts and slings before you begin, and choose the shortest way up. At first, it follows low angle knobby slabs but steepens towards the end. Don\'t hesitate here and just go for it! :)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Pitch 2&lt;/b&gt; (5.7, 180\'): The first crux of the climb. The crux move is right above the anchor before the first bolt. Holds here are small and the angle is steep. After the first bolt, the climb slightly eases but remains pretty sustained at 5.6-5.7. The routefinding on this pitch is pretty straight-forward since there are 9 bolts between anchors. You will need to pass \"zee tree\" on the right side and keep going for four more bolts until you reach the two-bolt anchor.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Pitch 3&lt;/b&gt; (5.3, 100\'): Easy knob and face climbing. Since there are only 3 bolts on that pitch, it really helps to locate them one at at time before you start climbing so you don\'t miss them and have to traverse or downclimb. There is another two-bolt anchor at the top of this pitch.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Pitch 4&lt;/b&gt; (5.4, 100-180\'): More easy knob and face climbing (although steep) until you reach the roof/flake. Place some trad pro here (.5-1.5\"). This spot can be used as a intermediate belay station. Continue around the roof on the left and up until you get to the easy slab at the base of the vertical crack that leads to the very top of the dome. Set up your belay station here (pro .6 to 2\").&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Pitch 5&lt;/b&gt; (5.7, 120\'): The second crux of the climb. From the belay station climb straight up to the base of the vertical wide crack. Lieback the crack until the angle eases. Follow the crack for a bit longer until you reach the big rock. Turn right at that rock and scramble up the easy slab until you get to the belay tree. Few tips for that pitch: bring large gear for the crack (3-4.5\"), use lots of slings and runners to minimize the rope drag, use radios (it is almost impossible to hear each other).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Descent&lt;/b&gt;: Once you top out, walk to the far northeast corner of the dome. You should find rappel slings and a station there. After a short but mostly overhanging rappel, go left and downclimb the 3rd-4th class boulders to the base of the dome. Circle around the dome to reach the parking lot.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;table class=\"inline_image_thumbs\"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=58283\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/58283.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=58290\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/58290.JPG\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_3\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Essential Gear&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;br&gt;Ten quickdraws, one set of .6 to 2\" gear (cams would be preferred), one-two sets of 3 to 4.5\" cams (depends on your level of comfort on the final 5.7 lieback), slings for the last pitch&lt;br&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_4\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Miscellaneous Info&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;br&gt;If you have information about this route that doesn\'t pertain to any of the other sections, please add it here.&lt;br&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_5\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Images&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div align=\"center\"&gt;&lt;table id=\"my_images\"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/zee-tree/298660/c-161336\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Zee Tree\" src=\"/images/square/298660.JPG\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/the-1st-pitch-of-zee-tree/58839/c-161336\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\'The 1st \"pitch\" of Zee Tree-...\' src=\"/images/square/58839.JPG\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/yds-5-7-zee-tree-on-pywiack/58283/c-161336\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"YDS 5.7 Zee Tree on Pywiack...\" src=\"/images/square/58283.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/halfway-up-the-5-7/58290/c-161336\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Halfway up the 5.7...\" src=\"/images/square/58290.JPG\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/zee-tree/298751/c-161336\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Zee Tree\" src=\"/images/square/298751.JPG\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/melinda-following-the-second/77957/c-161336\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\" Melinda following the second...\" src=\"/images/square/77957.JPG\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/pywiack-dome/255766/c-161336\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Pywiack Dome\" src=\"/images/square/255766.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/article&gt;date:'),(207,161508,'/hotlum-glacier/161508','/mount-shasta/150188','Hotlum Glacier','','','Class 4-5 depending on variation','','',24254,41.4094,-122.194,'California, United States, North America','','',150188,'Mount Shasta','','1.0','Snow/Glacier, Ice, Technical Rock','','One to two days','Route','content: &lt;article&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_1\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2 id=\"first_h2\"&gt;Overview&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;i&gt;I inherited this page from Bubba Suess in August 2012 and wanted to give my thanks to him for giving me the chance to build on it.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Though many visitors to Mount Shasta come and go without noticing it, the Hotlum Glacier is notable for being the largest glacier on Mount Shasta and the most easily accessible place in California to access glacier and crevasse features for mountaineering activities.  Due to its quality features this glacier is perhaps &lt;i&gt;the&lt;/i&gt; premier route on Shasta.  Even so, it goes unnoticed by the masses due to its geographic location on the northeast side of the mountain (far from the major highways most climbers use to arrive at the heavily frequented southwestern routes) and the summit topography (the north summit of Shasta blocks the glacier&rsquo;s features from view of the true summit.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;From the northeast the Hotlum Glacier is easily identified by the tall headwall that stands above it. First climbed in 1963 by Allen Steck and Bob Tripp, this glacier with its three icefalls, big crevasses and steep ice gullies provides variety of challenging options. The degree of difficulty will depend significantly on your chosen variation and is thus suitable to a variety of experienced climbers, yet in any case it is one of the more sustained and difficult climbs on the mountain and shouldn\'t be underestimated.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;noformat&gt; &lt;table class=\"inline_image_thumbs\"&gt; &lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=320722\" rel=\"nofollow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/320722.JPG\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=829186\" rel=\"nofollow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/829186.JPG\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=223124\" rel=\"nofollow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/223124.JPG\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=320730\" rel=\"nofollow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/320730.JPG\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=829187\" rel=\"nofollow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/829187.JPG\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=321442\" rel=\"nofollow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/321442.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/noformat&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_2\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Approach&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;div align=\"center\" class=\"image-left\" style=\"width: 506px;\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"/pavel-on-hotlum-glacier/320726\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Pavel on Hotlum Glacier\" height=\"374\" width=\"500\" src=\"/images/medium/320726.JPG\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=\"caption\"&gt;Early Morning on the Hotlum Glacier&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br&gt;The usual approach to Hotlum Glacier is from the Brewer Creek trailhead, though the glacier can be also approached from the North Gate trailhead.  Choosing the latter option accesses primarily the west lobe of the glacier until the midpoint, and though it bypasses the lower icefalls and crevasses present on the more featured eastern section of the glacier it remains a worthy climb and is utilized by some parties. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As needed please refer to excellent pages by Bubba Suess on the &lt;a href=\"http://www.summitpost.org/brewer-creek-trail/813934\"&gt;Brewer Creek Trail&lt;/a&gt; or the &lt;a href=\"http://www.summitpost.org/north-gate-trail/808967\"&gt;North Gate Trail&lt;/a&gt; for driving directions and complete description of the trail approach.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Brewer Creek&lt;/b&gt;  &lt;i&gt;(Aproximately 4 miles and 6900 feet elevation gain one way)&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When approaching from Brewer Creek simply follow the existing trail as it switchbacks gently up the northeast side of Shasta until it begins to approach treeline and a large moraine is visible directly up the mountain (or a bit to your right).  Use trails work your way towards the base of this easily identifiable landmark, and options are available to either climb the very steep slope up or traverse on a use trail up deep sandy slopes along the southern base of it (I&rsquo;ve found it acceptable to use the steeper, more rocky route up and the easy, sandy route down though snow conditions can change preferences).  Continue working your way up the mountain until you approach the base of the eastern Hotlum Glacier.  Good camps exist at a small lake at 10,100 feet or much more commonly at a similar location and elevation at a large unmapped &lt;a href=\"http://www.summitpost.org/camp-with-fresh-running-water/223120\"&gt;runoff stream&lt;/a&gt; just south of this point (use trails appear and disappear to lead to this location).  Excellent camps also exist on the southernmost moraine bordering the glacier just before it disappears at 10,700 feet into the snow below the lower headwall (left of the first icefall).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;North Gate&lt;/b&gt;  &lt;i&gt;(Aproximately 4 1/2 miles and 7200 feet elevation gain one way)&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If using the North Gate approach follow the trail until you get above the tree line. Above tree line cross the moraines to your left in any one of numerous feasible locations. Once on top of it, you will see a big flat area at 9500 feet that you will need to traverse. There are many great spots to set up a base camp here and during much of the season running water is likely to be found.  From the large flat area continue working your way up and left over snow and scree crossing another moraine as needed until you are below or cross onto the Hotlum Glacier. This approach also allows you also to make a side trip to Chicago Glacier, which is a good spot for crevasse rescue practice.&lt;a name=\"chapter_3\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Route Description&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;div align=\"center\" class=\"image-right\" style=\"width: 381px;\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"/climbing-on-hotlum-chicago-glacier/240727\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Climbing on Hotlum/Chicago glacier\" height=\"500\" width=\"375\" src=\"/images/medium/240727.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=\"caption\"&gt;Ice Play on the West Hotlum Glacier&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br&gt;If climbing the glacier from Brewer Creek, just above the highest realistic camp described above (at 10,700 feet) there is a headwall left of the first icefall.  Though the lower icefall can sometimes be climbed directly it is more typically bypassed to the right.  Continue working your way up the glacier soon passing another middle icefall on its left side and yet another upper icefall on the right (this is all extremely obvious as you climb the glacier).  There are many options, depending on your route-finding, commitment, and desired level of difficulty (or scenery).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Once across (or around) the bergschrund there are three main variations to the last portion of the climb, each with several subvariations. You can either climb directly up the headwall (very uncommon), ascend one of the ice gullies to the left of the headwall, or exit the gully to the right of the headwall.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Hotlum Headwall:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;The headwall itself requires 3-6 pitches of climbing extremely loose volcanic rock with the most difficult sections rated 5.8 and is rarely attempted for good reason.  If determined to take this variation this &lt;a href=\"http://blog.tuckercunningham.com/2012/08/climbing-hotlum-headwall-and-glacier.html\"&gt;trip report&lt;/a&gt; by Tucker Cunningham is an excellent starting resource.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Hotlum Left Ice Gully:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;The &lt;a href=\"http://www.summitpost.org/hotlum-left-ice-gully/829183\"&gt;ice gully&lt;/a&gt; to the left of headwall is sustained (up to 55 degrees) and requires crossing the bergschrund at its base. It curves first left and then to the right and ends above the top of the headwall. Later in the season a short scramble over loose talus is then required to reach the summit.  There are several variations available (extending from closest to the headwall to several chutes left of this) at the base of the route as you begin above the bergschrund, the most desirable will vary considerably depending on your desire for talus, rock, ice, or snow and the conditions at the time.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Hotlum Right Ice Gully:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Similarly to the left gully, the ice gully to the right of the headwall can be a nice ice climb, but it will tend to melt out and result in a loose scree climb prior to the option on the left.  If not equipped with proper ice gear (tools, screws, etc&hellip;) and conditions are prohibitive to the left of the headwall, the exit to the right is likely the best option.  As with the other routes, there are several variations on the precise path taken.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Descent Routes:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Rather than retracing your steps, the most common descent is the Hotlum-Wintun ridge, just drop down the snow slope immediately north of the summit (opposite where the main trail from the summit plateau reaches the summit area and south of the north summit area) and keep to the right side of the main ridge. After the ridge completely mellows out (no sooner!) cross over to the north and continue to camp or the Brewer Creek trailhead. The elevation of the crossover point is a bit over 12,000 feet, but note that is an imprecise number.  If beginning from North Gate the Hotlum-Bolam ridge is the best descent option.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If seeking to experience glacier travel without getting into technical ice or rock climbing conditions that may be present on some variations, it is possible to cross over early from the upper Hotlum Glacier to the step on the Hotlum-Bolam Ridge and climb the last portion of that route to the summit.  A similar option that has been used would be to climb to the left early after the upper icefall and join the Hotlum-Wintun Ridge.&lt;a name=\"chapter_4\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Mountain Condtions&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div class=\"thumb tleft\"&gt;&lt;div style=\"width:402px;\"&gt;&lt;a&gt;&lt;img width=\"400\" src=\"http://www.snowcrest.net/camera/highres.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;div class=\"thumbcaption\"&gt;&lt;div class=\"magnify\" style=\"float: right;\"&gt;&lt;a&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/layout/abby/magnify.gif\" alt=\"Enlarge\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;Mount Shasta Snowcrest Webcam&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;The rangers at the Mount Shasta Ranger Station are an excellent resource and can answer most questions about the current conditions or any other concerns climbers may have.

Camp locations exist near several pools and glacial runoff streams, and the frequented sites described here all have a good chance for both camping off snow and still within a short walk of running water after mid-season during most years. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For access to the east Hotlum Glacier from Brewer Creek most parties choose to camp just at or below the base of the glacier within the large lateral moraine to its south. Topographic maps show a small lake at 10,100 feet which makes for an ideal setting but slightly out of the way during most approaches. Use trails also lead to a similar more popular location at the same elevation alongside a large unmapped runoff stream just south (but out of view) of the lake. Excellent camps also exist on the southernmost glacial moraine  just before it disappears at 10,700 feet into the snow below the lower headwall and left of the first icefall. Though this latter option has great views and easy access for crevasse practice, it is very exposed should the wind or weather turn against you. All of these sites have room for at least a few tents of various sizes. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If beginning at North Gate and accessing the west side of the glacier, most parties choose to camp somewhere between the two large lateral moraines that must be crossed en route to the glacier that end just above and southeast of the North Gate Plug. There is a big flat area at 9500 feet with many great spots to set up a base camp and even a shallow pool that sometimes forms near the eastern moraine. It\'s possible, however, to camp a good bit higher for closer access to the glacier, though you should be more prepared to melt snow for water as you ascend the mountain. &lt;a name=\"chapter_6\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Essential Gear&lt;/h2&gt;Bringing crampons, ice axe, rope, harness, helmet, and crevasse rescue gear should be just as obvious as bringing shoes, pants, and a summit victory flask (or cigar). Depending on the chosen variation the climb may require rock protection (if climbing the headwall), or more commonly ice screws, pickets, and ice tools.  During much of the year the extra ice gear should be discretionary if you are flexible on the variation.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;noformat&gt; &lt;table class=\"inline_image_thumbs\"&gt; &lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=223123\" rel=\"nofollow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/223123.JPG\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=223127\" rel=\"nofollow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/223127.JPG\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=321440\" rel=\"nofollow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/321440.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=687155\" rel=\"nofollow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/687155.JPG\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=223129\" rel=\"nofollow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/223129.JPG\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=223128\" rel=\"nofollow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/223128.JPG\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/noformat&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_7\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Etymology&lt;/h2&gt;Western explorer Major John Wesley Powell named several of Shasta&rsquo;s glaciers.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&ldquo;Powell was a brilliant scholar who collected over two dozen dictionaries of Native American languages and dialects. During 1879 he came to northern California to study the Wintun tribe, and climbed Mt. Shasta on November 1, 1879. Afterward, he named Shasta&rsquo;s four other major glaciers with Wintun words in honor of the tribe: Hotlum (&lsquo;steep&rsquo;), Bolam (&lsquo;big&rsquo; or &lsquo;great&rsquo;), Konwakiton (&lsquo;muddy&rsquo;), and Wintun (the tribal name).

At about 9,600 ft., the trail will split. Take the L-hand (subsidiary) trail towards Crystal Lake. After descending briefly, you&rsquo;ll reach Crystal Lake. Cross its outlet. After briefly following a trail through the woods paralleling the lake&rsquo;s shore, a sign notifying climbers not to attempt climbing Crystal Crag unless first registering at the Mammoth Ranger Station will be reached. A climbers&rsquo; trail can be discerned branching to the L from the more prominent trail approximately 10 yards after this sign. Follow this intermittent trail to the base of the N Ar&ecirc;te of Crystal Crag. &lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;table class=\"inline_image_thumbs\"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=63343\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/63343.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=77850\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/77850.JPG\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=77848\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/77848.JPG\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=94791\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/94791.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_2\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Route Description&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;br&gt;Facing the north side of Crystal Crag, a steep, prominent R-facing corner will be obvious. This is a 5.8 variation that supposedly leads to the ar&ecirc;te proper as well. The standard 5.7 start is over a small rise to the right of said corner. The 5.7 start is also in a R-facing dihedral, which is lower angled and not quite as obvious as the aforementioned one. Look for a small tree growing on a ledge ~20 ft. up the route (keep going up the obvious dihedral above this point). Keep following the easiest line. The crux of the climb is found halfway up the first pitch, and consists of surmounting a bulge (at least the way we went). Various places for the leader to belay the follower up the first pitch are available- try to look for one as close as possible to a full 60-meter rope length. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;After the first pitch, take the path of least resistance, and go another full 60-meter rope length. This should put you right below the famous crystal section of the climb (look out for rubble on the ledges around here). Go to and through the crystal section- this should be 3rd or easy 4th class, depending on the chosen variation. Shortly following this, the false summit is attained. Down-climb 4th class rock to the notch between the false &amp;amp; true summits. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;From the notch, follow the ridge to the summit. This is considerably easier than the climbing encountered on the first 2 pitches (3rd to 4th-/easy 5th-class rock), but has considerable exposure on both sides- exciting! The summit block itself is about as pointy and exposed as any you&rsquo;re likely to find, &amp;amp; exhilaration and satisfaction may be had here.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Following the path of least resistance, down-climb 3rd- and 4th-class rock on the W face to get to the base of Crystal Crag. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;table class=\"inline_image_thumbs\"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=63320\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/63320.JPG\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=63333\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/63333.JPG\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=63334\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/63334.JPG\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=63312\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/63312.JPG\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=63318\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/63318.JPG\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_3\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Essential Gear&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;br&gt;&middot;

Winchell Col can be ascended from the east (Sam Mack Meadow) or west (Dusy Basin) sides. The west side would be easier since it does not involve snow / glacier travel, at least later in the season. If you come from the east side, you may have to negotiate the bergschrund. &lt;br&gt;Winchell Col consists of two notches separated by a rock formation called \"Dolphin Fin\". From the west side, it is easier to climb the higher notch located closer to Thunderbolt Peak so you don\'t have to go over \"Dolphin Fin\" on the way to the summit.&lt;br&gt;Since the west side approach is easier, it will be described in more detail. After starting at the South Lake trailhead, go over Bishop Pass (6 miles, 2K\' gain). Instead of dropping down into Dusy Basin, traverse the talus slope on the west side of Mt. Agassiz, past Agassiz Col and Mt. Winchell. Once you get to below Winchell Col, climb up into the right-hand notch. For the easiest going (Class 3-4), stay on ledges and large blocks on the left side of the notch. Instead of going to the lowest part of the notch, you can start traversing right towards Thunderbolt Peak and gain the NW ridge.&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;table class=\"inline_image_thumbs\"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=65450\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/65450.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=65449\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/65449.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=65455\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/65455.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_2\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Route Description&lt;/h2&gt;The NW ridge of Thunderbolt is a classic route and arguably one the better route on this mountain. The rock quality here is excellent, the climbing is sustained, and the exposure is tremendous! Even though this route looks straight-forward and short from below, don\'t let it fool you. It is pretty long and may take several hours to complete from Winchell Col, especially if you decide to rope up. This route is a great start for the popular Thunderbolt to Sill traverse.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Once you are on the ridge above Winchell Col, negotiate a 5th class headwall and continue up, staying as close to the ridge proper as possible. Here climbing will be anywhere from 3rd to mid-5th class for hundreds of feet. Approximately 2/3 of the way up the ridge, you will come across a drop off. You can either downclimb it (Class 5+) or rappel. There are existing rappel slings but you may want to bring your own just in case. One rappel will bring you back onto easier climbing. Continue to follow the ridge over blocks and headwalls until you get to below the north summit (Lightning Rod). Here you can either climb Lightning Rod (Class 5-5.8), or go around it on the right side towards the main summit.&lt;br&gt;Depending on how you choose to scale the main &lt;a href=\"http://www.summitpost.org/show/route_link.pl/route_id/918/object_id/39\"&gt;summit block&lt;/a&gt;, you may want to go around it on the left (East, 5.9) or right (West, 5.8) sides.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Descent&lt;/b&gt;: You can take any of the easier routes down (i.e. Southwest Chutes #1 and #2, West Face, Underhill Couloir), continue traversing to Startlight Peak or go back the way you came. &lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;table class=\"inline_image_thumbs\"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=65452\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/65452.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=65453\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/65453.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=65451\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/65451.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_3\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Essential Gear&lt;/h2&gt;Light alpine rope for the rappel, several slings for the rap station, small alpine rack if needed to protect Class 4-5 sections.

When I climbed it, and when looking at later seasons photos of the area, I don\'t think there is any danger of a bergschrund blocking passage to the notch. It is an easy and short snow climb and class 3 scramble from the Thunderbolt Glacier to the notch.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Roped Travel and the Cruxes&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Though there are some difficult and/or exposed parts of the ridge where one might want to rope up, much of the ridge is perfectly fine to solo or simul-climb.

Simul-climbing is good from here to summit.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In general, it is better to stay closer to the ridge crest, as the rock is more solid and a route usually presents itself along the crest.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;First Notch and Rappel&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;First, the rappel is not off of the high point before the notch, so don\'t climb to it unless you don\'t mind backtracking. Instead, once you are about 60 ft from the top, look for ledges to traverse left. These take you to an exposed slab with a notch at the end, low and left of the highpoint. Climb over to this and the rappel station is just behind the notch.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The rappel station is very exposed and there is no room for standing, only smearing. Due to limited space for belaying and setting up a rappel, I had Vitaly wait at the other side of the notch, though he was attached to the rappel anchor.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If you want to bail on the route, this is probably the easiest place to do so. After rappelling into the notch, it looks reasonable to downclimb the couloir back to the Thunderbolt Glacier.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Second Notch&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;You probably don\'t climb to the high point. Instead, once on easier terrain above the first notch, keep to the left and look for a good ledge system to the left of the ridge that cuts over just below the notch. We did &lt;a href=\"http://c0278592.cdn.cloudfiles.rackspacecloud.com/original/640830.jpg\"&gt;variation A&lt;/a&gt;, which is not ideal because of all of the downclimbing and backtracking. &lt;a href=\"http://c0278592.cdn.cloudfiles.rackspacecloud.com/original/640830.jpg\"&gt;Variation B&lt;/a&gt; is more direct, but I chose not to take this line staying more on the crest because of the knife-edged nature of it and the stacked rocks that you\'d be forced to pull on. It still might be the best line if the rocks are more solid than they look.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Unnamed Peak&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Just before the upper ridge traverse, there is a high point that is worth checking out.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Upper Ridge Traverse&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The upper part of the ridge where it stops ascending is one of the cruxes of the route. The ridge becomes knife-edge and becomes very exposed. In general, climb right along the spine of the ridge and around or through the cracked gendarmes. Occasionally you can drop down to the left (east) side of the ridge a short ways, until eventually you can see a ledge system that can be used the rest of the way to the end of the route, though not without some slight ups and downs. Don\'t descend too far from the ridge as the rocks become much looser the lower you go.&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td valign=\"bottom\" style=\"padding-top: 6px;\" colspan=\"2\"&gt;&lt;span style=\"font-size: 9px; color: #888;\"&gt;Posted Jul 24, 2010 6:32 pm&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;table border=\"0\" width=\"775\"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;table cellpadding=\"2\" cellspacing=\"2\" width=\"100%\"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;&lt;span class=\"pagertext\"&gt;Viewing: &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;-&lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt; of &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td align=\"center\"&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td align=\"right\"&gt;    &lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_6\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Images&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div align=\"center\"&gt;&lt;table id=\"my_images\"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/looking-back-at-lightning-rod/65453/c-161858\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Looking back at Lightning Rod...\" src=\"/images/square/65453.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/dolphin-fin-reflection/544152/c-161858\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Dolphin Fin Reflection\" src=\"/images/square/544152.JPG\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/bryan-is-climbing-towards/65450/c-161858\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Bryan is climbing towards...\" src=\"/images/square/65450.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/black-divide-peaks-and-dusy/65455/c-161858\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Black Divide peaks and Dusy...\" src=\"/images/square/65455.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/lightning-rod-left-and-the/65452/c-161858\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Lightning Rod (left) and the...\" src=\"/images/square/65452.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/the-thunderbolt-summits-from-the-nw-ridge/640833/c-161858\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"The Thunderbolt summits from the NW Ridge\" src=\"/images/square/640833.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/looking-towards-mt-winchell/65451/c-161858\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Looking towards Mt.

Hike along the Pine Creek Pass trail approximately seven miles to the trail\'s namesake pass, and then head west cross-country for a little over a mile to the outlet of Lake 11,656.  The cross-country travel is pleasant here over tundra and easy slabs.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Lake 11,656 can also be reached from the Italy Pass trail via Royce Pass (Pass 11,760ft+, located immediately NE of Lake 11,725).&lt;br&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_2\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Route Description&lt;/h2&gt;From the outlet of Lake 11,656, you should see Merriam\'s NE Ridge in profile on your right, and the peak\'s NE Face directly in front of you.  The NE face is a confusing mixture of slabs, cracks, and blocks when viewed from below, and there are likely many ways to go.  The route described here is but one variation.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Angle up and to your right over easy slabs to gain the base of the NE Ridge.  I encountered a short class 4 section at the base of the ridge, although this may be avoided by keeping left and climbing more slabs.  Above this, the ridge/face becomes very easy for a while, with the climbing consisting of class 2 blocks and ledges.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;After a while the ridge becomes more pronounced, a broad slabby chute below you to the left becomes more apparent than it was from below, and the climbing along the ridge eventually becomes more difficult (class 4-5 with many large, steep blocks).  Traverse down and left (exposed but easy) into the chute and follow this up.  Further up, the chute is split in two by a small buttress/rib; the left side eventually turns into class 5, but keeping to the right side is easier class 3.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Eventually, the chute comes to a short, steep headwall.  This appears to be a fairly difficult obstacle, and I didn\'t find an easy scramble way past this.  The NE Ridge at this point is also difficult.  The headwall is bypassed by traversing left across the steep face (class 4) to the rib that delineates the south wall of the chute.  Follow the rib up to the summit ridge.  I encountered a couple of moves verging on 5.easy here, but it may also be possible to traverse left (south) into the adjoining east chute to keep the difficulty down.  Once you reach the summit ridge, the summit is just a short walk away.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Note:  Secor\'s 2nd ed. claims that to climb Merriam\'s class 3 East Face, you should climb the chute immediately left of the NE Ridge.  Following these directions takes you to the aforementioned chute on the NE Face, which I don\'t believe is class 3 even by Sierra rating standards.  I believe he may have overlooked this shallow chute; the next chute to the south from this one is more prominent from below, appeared to be much easier from the summit, and is likely the class 3 East Face route.&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;table class=\"inline_image_thumbs\"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=65567\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/65567.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_3\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Essential Gear&lt;/h2&gt;None required for the face itself, although sticky approach shoes/rock shoes could be useful in places.  However, if you opt to descend via the Merriam-Royce saddle, an ice axe and possibly crampons would be helpful, although not strictly necessary--the snow is fairly low-angle with a friendly runout.  The usual generic advice of axe/crampons being necessary for the chute itself in early season applies.&lt;br&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_4\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Images&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div align=\"center\"&gt;&lt;table id=\"my_images\"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/merriam-peak-from-the-outlet/65567/c-161862\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Merriam Peak from the outlet...\" src=\"/images/square/65567.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/article&gt;date:difficulty:elevation:grade:'),(211,162276,'/right-side-topropes/162276','/pothole-dome/153127','Right Side Topropes','','','5.1 - 5.10a','','',2360,37.88,-119.392,'California, United States, North America','','',153127,'Pothole Dome','','1.0','Rock Climbs','','Less than two hours','Route','content: &lt;article&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_1\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2 id=\"first_h2\"&gt;Approach&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;br&gt;Park at the dirt pullout on the left just west of the Toulumne Meadows Gas Station.

It is really a highway. Very well maintained. Once you get to the Larch Valley there is a bench where people group up for the return tril through Bear country. Here you will head left over the grassy slopes down to a small drainage area then up the other side to the sholder of Eiffel. From this point it is a matter of picking your way up the slabs and scree to the summit. Most of it is easy scrambling. See the attached image. There is some loose rock so beware of your fellow climbers.

Of course everything comes with a price, which in this case means an elevation gain of over 5,000 vertical feet in just 2.5 miles of hiking.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Steepness aside, this is a fun and challenging route to the summit of one of the most remote and seldomly visited Wasatch Front summits.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Alternate descent routes include dropping to the west from the summit into thunder bowl, or following the knife ridge &plusmn;0.9 miles south to the summit of &lt;a href=\"http://www.summitpost.org/show/mountain_link.pl/mountain_id/2343\"&gt;&lt;b&gt;South Thunder Mountain&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.

Continue straight through the stoplight and follow the road another 4 miles to the mouth of Little Cottonwood Canyon, where an electronic billboard on the right provides current road and/or weather conditions. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;From the electronic billboard drive 1.9 miles east up Little Cottonwood Canyon, to the small powerplant located next to the stream on the south side of the road. Park in the small parking area adjacent to the road directly to the west of the powerplant.&lt;br&gt;&lt;div align=\"center\" class=\"image\" style=\"width: 506px;\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"/the-north-face-of-north/80708\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"The north face of North...\" height=\"187\" width=\"500\" src=\"/images/medium/80708.JPG\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=\"caption\"&gt;The Coalpit Gulch Headwall&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_3\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Stats&lt;/h2&gt;One-Way Hiking Distance: 2.5 miles&lt;br&gt;Elevation Gain: 5,080 ft.&lt;br&gt;Average Gain per Mile: 2,032 ft.&lt;br&gt;Trailhead Elevation: 6,070 ft. &lt;br&gt;Summit Elevation: 11,150 ft.&lt;br&gt;&lt;div align=\"center\" class=\"image\" style=\"width: 506px;\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"/northeast-ridge/216406\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Northeast Ridge\" height=\"375\" width=\"500\" src=\"/images/medium/216406.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=\"caption\"&gt;Ascending the Northeast Ridge&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_4\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Route Description&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;div align=\"center\" class=\"image-left\" style=\"width: 167px;\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"/this-photo-taken-near-the/80707\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"This photo taken near the...\" height=\"200\" width=\"161\" src=\"/images/small/80707.JPG\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=\"caption\"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br&gt;From the parking area cross the bridge to the south side of the stream and turn left (east).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Follow the trail approximately 0.2 miles east, then begin looking for vague use trails on the right heading south.  There are several of these faint trails, some of which will fade out after a short distance.  Coalpit Gulch is the prominent notch in the wall of the canyon, approximately 0.2 miles south of the road.  With a little luck you will end up on the main trail into the gulch, otherwise plan on some &lt;a href=\"http://www.alpenglow.org/themes/subalpine/brush-ratings.html\" target=\"blank\"&gt;Class BW3 - BW4&lt;/a&gt; bushwhacking as you routefind your way into the gulch.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Entering Coalpit Gulch the canyon walls quickly steepen on both sides; a number of bolted rock climbs line the wall on the east.  A short distance after entering the gulch a small waterfall is bypassed on the left.&lt;br&gt;&lt;div align=\"center\" class=\"image-right\" style=\"width: 139px;\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"/coalpit-gulch-north-thunder-mountain/225037\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Coalpit Gulch - North Thunder Mountain\" height=\"200\" width=\"133\" src=\"/images/small/225037.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=\"caption\"&gt;First Waterfall&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br&gt;Continue up the drainage staying near the left (east) wall of the drainage.  Roughly 100 yards above the first waterfall is a large overhanging boulder which effectively blocks progress along the left wall.  Around the corner on the right is a second waterfall approximately 25 feet high; it may be possible to ascend the ledges to the right of the falls, but the rock near the falls is worn smooth and any spray from the waterfall will make the footing treacherous.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The preferred route through this section is a very steep slope dotted with several small pines, located roughly midway between the waterfall and the overhanging boulder.  Climb directly up this slope through the trees, being very cautious as the dirt and rocks in this area are very loose.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Above this section the angle decreases briefly, and the stream moves to the far left side of the gulch.  A short distance ahead is a third small waterfall, visible near the center of &lt;a href=\"http://www.summitpost.org/mountains/photo_link.pl?photo_id=122166&amp;amp;object_id=4033&amp;amp;type=mountain&amp;amp;mountain_id=4033&amp;amp;route_id=4380\"&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; photo.&lt;br&gt;&lt;div align=\"center\" class=\"image-left\" style=\"width: 206px;\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"/coalpit-gulch-north-thunder-mountain/225043\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Coalpit Gulch - North Thunder Mountain\" height=\"133\" width=\"200\" src=\"/images/small/225043.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=\"caption\"&gt;Second Waterfall&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br&gt;This third waterfall is short (~10 feet) but involves tricky scrambling on loose (and very slippery if wet) rock.  At the base of the falls climb up to a small ledge of broken rock on the right wall adjacent to the falls, then carefully traverse south back to the streambed above the falls.  The most difficult scrambling of the route is now behind you.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Continue following the drainage as the gulch slowly begins to widen.  At several locations the streambed will diverge into several smaller drainages; pick the ones which appear easiest to follow.  Stay in or near the drainages as much as possible to avoid brush, but accept the fact that some bushwhacking will be required.&lt;br&gt;&lt;div align=\"center\" class=\"image-right\" style=\"width: 156px;\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"/looking-up-lower-coalpit-gulch/80705\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Looking Up Lower Coalpit Gulch\" height=\"200\" width=\"150\" src=\"/images/small/80705.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=\"caption\"&gt;Third Waterfall&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br&gt;Higher up in the gulch a large boulder field is reached.  Follow the boulder field upward, aiming for the lowest spot on the forested skyline directly south, until finally arriving in a large &lt;a href=\"http://www.summitpost.org/mountains/photo_link.pl?photo_id=122169&amp;amp;object_id=4033&amp;amp;type=mountain&amp;amp;mountain_id=4033&amp;amp;route_id=4380\"&gt;open cirque&lt;/a&gt; at an elevation of approximately 9,500 ft.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;From this cirque will be the first clear view of the north face of North Thunder Mountain.  On the left a grassy slope leads up to a saddle at the base of the north-east summit ridge.  Ascend the slope up to the saddle, where an impressive view into Hogum Gulch to the east will open up.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;From the saddle follow the &lt;a href=\"http://www.summitpost.org/mountains/photo_link.pl?photo_id=122170&amp;amp;object_id=4033&amp;amp;type=mountain&amp;amp;mountain_id=4033&amp;amp;route_id=4380\"&gt;northeast ridge&lt;/a&gt; as it climbs toward the summit.  The ridge is steep and there is some exposure in spots, but careful routefinding will keep the scrambling to easy 3rd class.  The high point on this ridge is a false summit, but the true summit is a fairly level and easy scramble about 100 yards to the south.&lt;a name=\"chapter_5\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Essential Gear&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;div align=\"center\" class=\"image-left\" style=\"width: 206px;\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"/coalpit-gulch-north-thunder-mountain/225034\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Coalpit Gulch - North Thunder Mountain\" height=\"133\" width=\"200\" src=\"/images/small/225034.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=\"caption\"&gt;Entrance to Coalpit Gulch&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br&gt;Sturdy hiking boots with grippy soles.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The route involves a rather tricky climb around a short waterfall in the stream bed.  A short (20-30 meter) rope for rappelling this spot on the downclimb is strongly recommended.                                                                                                                                                                        &lt;a name=\"chapter_6\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Images&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div align=\"center\"&gt;&lt;table id=\"my_images\"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/looking-up-the-north-east/80709/c-163144\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Looking up the north-east...\" src=\"/images/square/80709.JPG\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/the-north-face-of-north/80708/c-163144\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"The north face of North...\" src=\"/images/square/80708.JPG\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/this-photo-taken-near-the/80707/c-163144\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"This photo taken near the...\" src=\"/images/square/80707.JPG\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/looking-up-lower-coalpit-gulch/80705/c-163144\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Looking Up Lower Coalpit Gulch\" src=\"/images/square/80705.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/coalpit-gulch-north-thunder-mountain/225032/c-163144\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Coalpit Gulch - North Thunder Mountain\" src=\"/images/square/225032.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/coalpit-gulch-north-thunder-mountain/225043/c-163144\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Coalpit Gulch - North Thunder Mountain\" src=\"/images/square/225043.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/n-thunder-via-coalpit-gulch/332139/c-163144\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"N Thunder via Coalpit Gulch\" src=\"/images/square/332139.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/northeast-ridge/216406/c-163144\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Northeast Ridge\" src=\"/images/square/216406.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/boarding-the-gulch/446876/c-163144\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Boarding the Gulch\" src=\"/images/square/446876.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/coalpit-gulch-north-thunder-mountain/225021/c-163144\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Coalpit Gulch - North Thunder Mountain\" src=\"/images/square/225021.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/coalpit-gulch-north-thunder-mountain/225029/c-163144\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Coalpit Gulch - North Thunder Mountain\" src=\"/images/square/225029.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/coalpit-gulch-north-thunder-mountain/225034/c-163144\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Coalpit Gulch - North Thunder Mountain\" src=\"/images/square/225034.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/coalpit-gulch-north-thunder-mountain/225037/c-163144\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Coalpit Gulch - North Thunder Mountain\" src=\"/images/square/225037.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/coalpit-gulch-north-thunder-mountain/225040/c-163144\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Coalpit Gulch - North Thunder Mountain\" src=\"/images/square/225040.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td colspan=\"7\" align=\"center\"&gt;[ &lt;a href=\"/coalpit-gulch/images/p-163144\"&gt;View Gallery - 13 More Images&lt;/a&gt; ]&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/article&gt;date:'),(214,163146,'/west-face-via-bells-canyon/163146','/north-thunder-mountain/153420','West Face via Bells Canyon','','','Class 3','','',5409,40.5435,-111.731,'Utah, United States, North America','','',153420,'North Thunder Mountain','','1.0','Hike with scrambling and routefinding','','Most of a day','Route','content: &lt;article&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_1\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2 id=\"first_h2\"&gt;Overview&lt;/h2&gt;This is the longer of the two primary routes to the summit of North Thunder Mountain.

From the saddle the route crosses Thunder Bowl, then ascends the west face of North Thunder.&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;table class=\"inline_image_thumbs\"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=80700\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/80700.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=80701\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/80701.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_2\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Getting There&lt;/h2&gt;The Bells Canyon trailhead begins at 10245 South Wasatch Boulevard.  There is a parking area for the trailhead on the east side of Wasatch Boulevard.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;To reach the Bells Canyon trailhead from I-215, take the 6200 South exit and follow Wasatch Boulevard south for approximately 6 miles to 10245 South.  The Bells Canyon trailhead can also be accessed via I-15 by taking the 9000 South Exit, then following 9000 South east for 6 miles to Wasatch Boulevard (by which time 9000 South has become 9800 South).  Turn right (south) on Wasatch Boulevard and drive for 0.7 miles to the trailhead parking area.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For GPS users, the Bells Canyon trailhead is located at NAD27 12T 432036E 4490598N, el. 5,120 ft.&lt;br&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_3\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Stats&lt;/h2&gt;One-Way Hiking Distance: 5.25 miles &lt;br&gt;Elevation Gain: 6,030 ft.&lt;br&gt;Average Gain per Mile: 1,150 ft.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Trailhead Elevation: 5,120 ft. &lt;br&gt;Summit Elevation: 11,150 ft.&lt;br&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_4\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Route Description&lt;/h2&gt;From the Bells Canyon Trailhead at the north end of the parking area, follow the trail up though a residential area, across a bridge, then up a steep stretch to Lower Bells Canyon Reservoir. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Follow the dirt road which circles around the west and then north sides of the reservoir. About 200 yards beyond the reservoir the Bells Canyon trail leaves the road on the left, marked by a sign. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;After leaving the dirt road the trail meanders through brush and scrub oak until it reaches a small bridge over the Bells Canyon stream, approximately 0.5 miles from the lower reservoir. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;From the bridge the trail continues east on the south side of the stream for approximately 2 miles, then makes a sharp turn to the right (south). Approximately 100 yards after making the turn south, cross to the east side of the stream on a very primitive \'bridge\' constructed of logs and 2x4\'s (during periods of low runoff the stream may be crossed at a number of other spots as well). &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Pick up the trail on the east side of the stream and continue hiking south. From this point onward the trail slowly deteriorates and becomes increasingly difficult to follow. If the trail is lost just continue heading south and upward along the path of least resistance, and eventually either the trail or a periodic cairn should be spotted - do your best, and try to keep the cursing to a minimum. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Approximately 4 miles from the trailhead the Upper Bells Canyon Reservoir will be reached. There is no trail beyond the reservoir, so routefinding will be required for the remainder of the hike.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;From the north-east corner of the reservoir, begin moving up the slopes heading in a generally south-east direction.  There are occasional cliffbands which must be navigated around, but the going is generally quite easy.  The best strategy is to continue moving upwards and avoid any elevation loss.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Slowly begin contouring in a more easterly direction, as the terrain permits.  The target is a saddle to the east, which is the low spot on the ridge dividing Bells Canyon from Thunder Bowl to the east.  Upon reaching this saddle the west face of North Thunder will come into view for the first time.  The approximate route to be followed is as shown in &lt;a href=\"http://www.summitpost.org/mountains/photo_link.pl/p/photo_id__122161__object_id__16537__type__user__mountain_id____route_id____user_id____order_by____limit__\"&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; photo.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;From the saddle drop approximately 80-100 feet into Thunder Bowl, then head for the steep rock-strewn slopes leading up to the summit ridge.  The slope is gradual at first but becomes increasingly steep as it nears the ridge to the north of the summit.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Near the top of the slopes there appear to be at least two relatively easy lines which may be followed to the summit ridge.  Careful routefinding will keep the scramble up to the ridge at fairly easy 3rd class.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Upon reaching the ridge turn right (south) and follow the ridge for approximately 100 yards of easy scrambling to the summit.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A summit register is contained in a mailbox underneath the summit block.&lt;br&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_5\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Essential Gear&lt;/h2&gt;Standard summer hiking gear for a fairly long hike. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;An ice axe may be handy for spring and early summer hikes. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;During mid-summer the bugs in upper Bells Canyon can be savage - don\'t forget your DEET.&lt;br&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_6\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Images&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div align=\"center\"&gt;&lt;table id=\"my_images\"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/route-up-the-west-face-of/80700/c-163146\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Route up the west face of...\" src=\"/images/square/80700.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/top-of-the-west-face-route/512308/c-163146\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Top of the west face route\" src=\"/images/square/512308.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/above-the-reservoir/211309/c-163146\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Above the reservoir\" src=\"/images/square/211309.JPG\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/crux-of-the-west-face-route/413289/c-163146\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"crux of the West Face route\" src=\"/images/square/413289.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/ascending-the-west-slopes/80701/c-163146\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Ascending the west slopes...\" src=\"/images/square/80701.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/thunder-bowl/211307/c-163146\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Thunder Bowl\" src=\"/images/square/211307.JPG\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/twin-peaks/211305/c-163146\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Twin Peaks\" src=\"/images/square/211305.JPG\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/the-bowl/211308/c-163146\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"The Bowl\" src=\"/images/square/211308.JPG\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/little-cottonwood-canyon/211306/c-163146\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Little Cottonwood Canyon\" src=\"/images/square/211306.JPG\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/article&gt;date:'),(215,163704,'/men-at-work/163704','/pothole-dome/153127','Men at Work','','','Class 2+/3-','','',3889,37.88,-119.392,'California, United States, North America','','',153127,'Pothole Dome','','1.0','Friction/face climbing','','Less than two hours','Route','content: &lt;article&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_1\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2 id=\"first_h2\"&gt;Approach&lt;/h2&gt;Start at the standard combined tourist/climber &lt;i&gt;paved&lt;/i&gt; parking lot directly south of Pothole Dome- the first parking lot encountered after getting to Tuolumne Meadows from the west. Park here. The obvious approach trail is visible, leading into the forest beneath the face.&lt;br&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_2\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Route Description&lt;/h2&gt;Following the fairly short approach, upon emerging from the trees, you will be greeted abruptly by the direct South Face of Pothole Dome. Men at Work goes straight up this, one of Pothole Dome\'s steepest faces. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The first pitch passes Pothole Dome\'s namesake \'potholes,\' strange undulating depressions in the rock. Leaders should be strong class-2 climbers before attempting this climb, as the rock is compact, and there are few places (if any) to place pro\'. This luckily means that the rock is bomber, as on other high quality Tuolumne climbs. Footholds, as well as handholds if one reaches down, are plentiful. The whole pitch is fairly sustained class 2-3.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Following the first pitch, a false summit will be encountered. A broad bench must be traversed here (100-200\' in length) to the base of the summit block. While this pitch is sustained (class 1), strong parties should consider simul-climbing this section to save time. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If tackled directly, the summit block goes at a solid 2+ (perhaps 3-). Difficulties may also be skirted on the right.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Once the summit block is surmounted, congratulate yourself- you can go no higher on Pothole Dome. Admire the astounding views of Tuolumne Meadows, &amp;amp; contemplate your next Tuolumne climb- Crying Time Again on Lembert Dome, the Regular Route of Fairview Dome, Cathedral Peak\'s classic SE Buttress, or perhaps Unicorn Peak or the Echo Peaks? The day is yours. You\'ve joined the small (probably less than 1 or 2 million) group of climbers who has summited this great peak. This is one of the classic summits of Tuolumne Meadows.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;To return to your car, take the easy class 1/2 slopes of the SE face of Pothole Dome, or if you\'re feeling confident enough, downclimb the way you came up.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;While strong parties should be able to summit in less than 15 minutes, count on 5 to 10 additional minutes if unmotivated or obese climbers are included in the group. If thunderclouds are directly overhead, descent is advised. &lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;table class=\"inline_image_thumbs\"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=87163\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/87163.JPG\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=87166\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/87166.JPG\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=87162\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/87162.JPG\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=87165\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/87165.JPG\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_3\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Essential Gear&lt;/h2&gt;Sticky (or not) shoes, water if you want.

You have a north angled chimney to ascend and descend going to the north summit, an easy scramble to the middle with one short exposed section, a fun short glissade over to the col between the middle and south summit (where you make your final descent), and the &lt;b&gt;most challenging obstacle, (when full of snow) the tunnel to the south summit&lt;/b&gt; which can make for some tight and slightly exposed climbing.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The south peak is the most difficult of the three.  The route begins just below the center-south peak col in a north facing gully.  Scramble up steep rock in the gully  for about 8 m toward a narrow tunnel.  The tunnel can be a challenge.   Once through the tunnel, work your way across ledges to the south and intersect the south ridge.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;On descent, return to the center-south col and descend back to the Cory Pass Trail.  Avoid down slopping slabs.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;You have great views of Mount Louis and the Gmoser route up that mountain (great route!).  You are awarded a good view of Cory to the west as well, another common scramble.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;a target=\"_top\" href=\"/mountains/photo_link.pl?photo_id=153372&amp;amp;object_id=280&amp;amp;type=mountain&amp;amp;mountain_id=280&amp;amp;route_id=\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"http://www.summitpost.com/images/thumb/104190.jpg\" alt=\"Tooltip for IE: Gamskofel\" title=\"Tooltip for Mozilla: Gamskofel\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_3\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Essential Gear&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;br&gt;Helmet,  Alpine Ax (looks good even if you don&rsquo;t us it), Camera (great shots of Louis, Cory and Fifi) and Gaiters for scree descent&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_4\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Images&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div align=\"center\"&gt;&lt;table id=\"my_images\"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/the-view-back-north-on-the/108004/c-165318\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"The View back North on the...\" src=\"/images/square/108004.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/getting-up-the-tunnel-on-the/108002/c-165318\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Getting up the Tunnel on the...\" src=\"/images/square/108002.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/navigating-the-north-peak-of/108003/c-165318\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Navigating the North Peak of...\" src=\"/images/square/108003.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/hands-on-climbing-middle/108001/c-165318\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Hands on Climbing, Middle...\" src=\"/images/square/108001.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/article&gt;date:'),(218,165356,'/cory-scramble/165356','/mount-cory/154182','Cory Scramble','','','Moderate','','',3019,51.2014,-115.689,'Alberta, Canada, North America','','',154182,'Mount Cory','','0.49230769230769234','Scrambling','Summer','Most of a day','Route','content: &lt;article&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_1\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2 id=\"first_h2\"&gt;Approach&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;i&gt;This is a 4900&rsquo;+/- ascent day&lt;/i&gt;.  There are several large ribs coming down from Mount Cory.   You want the eastern most rib which is identified as light-colored shaley cliffs with a deep ravine to its right. In the winter, there is no trail to follow, but basically start  ascending due north.  This rib will meander somewhat westerly in and out of trees.   I  used snowshoes intermittently.   A 3000\' gain takes you to a lovely spot to enjoy lunch, a small col of sorts between a bump on the left (actually directly over &ldquo;Hole in the Wall&rdquo;)  and the start of your objective to the right.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;table class=\"inline_image_thumbs\"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=108548\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/108548.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=108549\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/108549.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=108550\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/108550.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=111539\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/111539.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=126431\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/126431.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_2\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Route Description&lt;/h2&gt;Attempt, depending on conditions, to traverse the left hand side of the route to avoid a gain that you will immediately have to lose.  There will be several up and down segments on the ridge, but none as wasteful as this first one.  This was a pleasant climb mixing some hands on scrambling and post holing, sporting a fantastic view during this section of the route.  I met up with 5 ewes (mountain sheep) about half way along during the summit trip.  This is  very active sheep habitat.  Part of the ridge remains windblown most of the winter offering up some remnants of nutrition.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Eventually, you will be upon the final summit ridge.  &lt;b&gt;Finishing this route in the winter can be a dangerous solo.  I chose to up climb and then down climb a buttress on the right to avoid having to traverse an angled icy snow slope straight away.  At that point there was snow-ice that I climbed with axe and crampons to gain the partially snow covered summit ridge.&lt;/b&gt;  Weaving in and out, I took the ridge to the summit cornice.  Beware of the cornice, it could go either direction.  If going in pairs, I advise taking a rope for added comfort on the summit itself.

Then shortly take a left onto the St. Piran trail prior to arriving at the Little Beehive.  This single track winds its way up to the summit.  The crux?  Don&rsquo;t get trampled by tourists on the way up Lake Agnes trail.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Dow&rsquo;s version:&lt;/b&gt;  I obviously chose a unique route. This is a hike really, so I used it as a multi task day.   I took several family members to Louise Falls to rock climb easy 5.6\'s.  When they were ready from some refreshment at the Plains of the Six Glaciers Teahouse, I took off up from the Louise Falls climbing area and bushwhacked my way 1000&rsquo; straight up and over a couple of small rock bands and topped out onto the Highline trail below Big Beehive.  I  then proceeded northeast past the bewildered guests at the Lake Agnes Tea house and onto Little Beehive trail.  I left the marked trail as soon as I saw the east face of St. Piran and made a true scramble ascent versus utilizing the trail.  In retrospect, I normally am very respectful of existing trails, but had no beta with me at the time and did not realize a trail took you to the summit.  I did notice that the Pikas on this route were friendlier than most, leading me to believe I was not the only person making tracks up the east face.&lt;br&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_3\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Essential Gear&lt;/h2&gt;Normal hiking paraphernalia.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Shell pants and gaitors recommended for early season to take advantage of glissading down the excellent snow gulleys! &lt;br&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_4\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Images&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div align=\"center\"&gt;&lt;table id=\"my_images\"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/the-summit-of-mt-st-piran/109774/c-165478\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"The Summit of Mt.

The Saddleback trail starts near the boathouse along the southern lake shore.  Take the Saddleback Trail to the saddle between Saddle Peak and Fairview (3.7 km at 2200\' gain).  I could have used spikes (not crampons) on the trail (ice) on the way to the saddle.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;a target=\"_top\" href=\"/mountains/photo_link.pl?photo_id=155665&amp;amp;object_id=2374&amp;amp;type=mountain&amp;amp;mountain_id=2374&amp;amp;route_id=\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"http://www.summitpost.com/images/thumb/105919.jpg\" alt=\"Tooltip for IE: Gamskofel\" title=\"Tooltip for Mozilla: Gamskofel\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a target=\"_top\" href=\"/mountains/photo_link.pl?photo_id=163100&amp;amp;object_id=265&amp;amp;type=mountain&amp;amp;mountain_id=265&amp;amp;route_id=\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"http://www.summitpost.com/images/thumb/111599.jpg\" alt=\"Tooltip for IE: Gamskofel\" title=\"Tooltip for Mozilla: Gamskofel\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;table class=\"inline_image_thumbs\"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=127111\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/127111.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_2\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Route Description&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;br&gt;Once at the saddle, turn right and ascend the southeast scree slope to Fairview\'s summit.  We had fresh snow, therefore, no trail to follow.  We did have snow from Lake Louise on up and were post holing it from the saddle to the summit (1200\' gain).  The glissade down in snow is very quick.   &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The views are tremendous for such a small mountain with easy access.  They include, Haddo, Aberdeen, Temple, Valley of the Ten Peaks, Whyte, Niblock, Victoria and the Deathtrap, Daly, Richardson, etc.  There appears to be no summit cairn or register.  However, there is a great photo op as per the dog photo above.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The adjacent Saddle Mountain can be ascended with minimal extra effort.&lt;br&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_3\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Essential Gear&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;br&gt;Ice Walkers and Gaiters if early season.

If you have even minimal rock climbing skills, you probably will want to do Venusian Blind Arete or some other route. If you don\'t want to mess with protection and ropes and feel confident on class 4, this route is great. There are 2 sections of class 4 and about a hundred feet of class 3. The rest is class 2 or less.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;update 7/31/05: I just looked in Secor\'s book which I do not own and he gives the \"contact crack\" (&lt;a href=\"http://www.summitpost.org/mountains/photo_link.pl?photo_id=168026&amp;amp;object_id=780&amp;amp;type=mountain&amp;amp;mountain_id=780&amp;amp;route_id=5882\"&gt; pictured here&lt;/a&gt;) a 5.2 rating. Knowing that the difference between class 4 and easy class 5 is often debatable, I am leaving the refernces to class 4 in the route description but changed the difficulty at top of this page from class 4 to 5.2. I still think if you feel confident on class 4, this route should be no problem at all. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The approach to Temple Crag is quite relaxing compared to hikes to the base of other peaks. From Big Pine, head west on Glacier Lodge Road for just shy of 10 miles to the trailhead parking. Follow the trail which follows along the north side of the North Fork of Big Pine Creek until your reach Second Lake. There are great places to camp on the south side of the trail and even a few in-between the lakes. I did the full approach and climbed the snow all the way to the top of Contact Pass in sandals so hopefully that will give you a taste of what the approach is like.&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;table class=\"inline_image_thumbs\"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=115181\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/115181.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_2\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Route Description&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;br&gt;From Second Lake, cross over to the the south sides of the lakes near the base of Temple Crag\'s butress. Follow along the south side of Temple Crag up towards contact pass. There likely will be (depending upon snow level and season climbed) a snow chute that must be ascended to gain the pass. Once atop the pass (and I mean, right at the crest), look left and locate the obvious chimney up the rock. Climb the chimeny to a point about 35-40 feet above the top of the pass to where you see rappel slings often used to descend the chimney.  Note, it may be difficult to climb this chimney wearing a large pack.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Once even with the rappel slings, climb the class 3 rocks to the top of the ridge. Once the ridge is gained, it is class 2 all the way to the summit block. You will want to follow the ridge and then tend left (west) towards the summit. The second and last section of class 4 is here to reach the summit. At the base of the summit block, one must descend about 12 feet and then climb the obvious crack to the summit. This is about 15 feet of very exposed class 4. Once at the summit, sign, enjoy the view, and descend the same way up. One can rappel the class 4 section at the top of Contact pass if he or she desires but this is not necessary if you are minimally comfortable on class 4.&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;table class=\"inline_image_thumbs\"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=126242\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/126242.JPG\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=115183\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/115183.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=115182\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/115182.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=115184\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/115184.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=115185\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/115185.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_3\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Essential Gear&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;br&gt;Bring a ~100 ft rope if you wish to rappel back down the class four chimney at Contact Pass.

Starting from the trailhead on Division Creek Rd follow the trail as it climbs up the East slope of Sawmill Point. This section is characteristically hot and dry, so bring lots of water. There is NO shade until you reach 7200ft. The trail climbs continuously until it reaches the ridgeline, then drops 200ft down to the \"Hogsback\". You are now in Sawmill Canyon, which is appropriately named for the pine forests it holds. You\'ll climb up the Hogsback for several miles to Sawmill Meadow. There are several creek crossings all of which are easy, though in the early season the trail often floods in numerous spots so be ready for mud. Once at Sawmill Meadow the Canyon begins to open up, and you climb a bit steeper up to Mule Lake then Sawmill Lake. The best camping spots are near Sawmill Meadow and at 9500ft before Mule Lake.  After you pass Sawmill Lake it is only a little over 1000ft to the pass, on mostly rocky terrain so very few camping opportunities. The pass comes up very quickly, once there drop 400ft down the West side toward the basin to the right of the trail. Cedric Wright dominates the skyline once you top out on the pass. Stay on top of the ridge that runs up toward Cedric Wright and the pinnacle to its South.&lt;br&gt;Time Required is from the Woods Lake Basin, not the trail head.&lt;br&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_2\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Route Description&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Southeast slope runs directly up from Lake 3480m. On the left will be peak 3721m and the sandy talus filled SE slope will present itself to your right. A large bowl separates the two, in early season this is often filled with snow so. Scramble up the talus and sand toward the Southern end of the ridge. The rocky pinnacle near the Southern end is your goal. One can also traverse over or around the South side of peak 3721m for more technical scrambling, though there is much loose rock on this mountain so be careful.&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;table class=\"inline_image_thumbs\"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=115939\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/115939.JPG\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=116028\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/116028.JPG\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_3\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Essential Gear&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;br&gt;No technical gear is required during normal summer climbing months.

This brings you to the saddle between Cedric Wright and Colosseum, the start of this route.&lt;br&gt;Time Required is from the Woods Lake Basin, not the trail head.&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;table class=\"inline_image_thumbs\"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=115937\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/115937.JPG\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_2\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Route Description&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://www.summitpost.org/mountains/photo_link.pl/p/photo_id__169139__object_id__5220__type__mountain__mountain_id__5220__route_id____user_id____order_by____limit__\"&gt;TOPO!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;From the saddle the ridge lies to your left or West. It is best to traverse 20ft to the right(North) to gain the ridge. The first part of the ridge is solid class 3 blocks and steps. The scramble is very straight forward, follow the ridge as it twists from North to West.  The first several hundred feet follow very solid granite and the exposure is minimal. After surmounting the first section the direct ridge is mostly class 2. At 3700m traverse South around a small false summit, the scenery then changes to dark volcanic rock. Follow the ridgeline, the only difficulty is a pinnacle 1/3 of the way up this final ridge. It can be traversed around on the East side(class 2) or climbed directly over(class 3).  Once around this pinnacle follow the ridgeline to the far South end where the summit block lies.&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;table class=\"inline_image_thumbs\"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=115941\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/115941.JPG\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_3\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Essential Gear&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;br&gt;No technical gear needed during normal summer climbing months. In early season or winter ice axe and crampons would be required for the hike up Sawmill Pass and for the summit ridgeline.

Emerson. The West Face is a broad slope, narrowing as it rises up to the flattish summit area that marks the northwest summit (this is the point marked on the 7.5\' map, but it is not the highpoint. The West Ridge proper is the ridgeline running between the northwest and southeast summits, a little less than 1/2 mile in length.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The West Face can be approached by a shorter, but steeper route by following the seasonal creek north from Piute Lake (around 11,000ft). &lt;a href=\"http://www.summitpost.org/mountains/user_link.pl?user_id=13699\"&gt;thebeave7&lt;/a&gt; adds: &lt;i&gt;head up a grassy ramp just West of this &lt;a href=\"http://www.summitpost.org/mountains/photo_link.pl/p/photo_id__185392__object_id__1358__type__mountain__mountain_id__1358__route_id____user_id____order_by____limit__\"&gt;&lt;i&gt;boulder field&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The ramp ascends above the cliffs seen on the left side of the photo, then heads straight up the boulder field into the wash. The stream bed is easily navigated, though this may be complicated in early season, due to high run off. Stay to the right when the stream bed splits. Following this brings one to the base of the class 3 West Face. The route up to the base of the West face is Class 2.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;You can also leave the Piute Trail halfway between Piute Lake and Piute Pass (around 11,200ft), climbing the benches north of the trail (class 2-3) into Humphreys Basin.&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;table class=\"inline_image_thumbs\"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=122405\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/122405.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_2\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Route Description&lt;/h2&gt;From Humphreys Basin below, it is pretty clear that the left (north) half of the West Face is peppered with significant cliffs and the right half is an easier climb. Find any of several breaks in the weak cliffs on the right side that go class 2-3 and lead to the class 2 slopes above and the northwest summit. For a spicier class 3-4 climb, attack the left side of the West Face and make your way through mostly class 3 rock in the cliff areas. You can also climb the NW Ridge of the West Face from its start, bypassing gendarmes on the west side.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Once at the northwest summit, the easiest route follows below the ridgeline on the south side, no more than class 3. This involves much talus and crossing several aretes and the intervening chutes on the South Face, and is the route described by Secor.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The West Ridge can be followed more directly, never deviating from the ridge by more than about 10ft with difficulties increasing to mostly class 4, with a low class 5 crux. This is really a very enjoyable scramble on solid rock, much better than the easier alternative. The crux is a 15-foot face with great hand holds in a crack, but not much for your feet while hanging in the middle of it. This can of course be bypassed on the south side of the ridge, but you\'ll regret missing it later... :-)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The easiest descent from the southeast summit is down the South Slopes. Choose one of several scree-filled chutes (class 2-3) for the descent down to the Piute Pass Trail.&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;table class=\"inline_image_thumbs\"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=122407\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/122407.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_3\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Essential Gear&lt;/h2&gt;None needed.&lt;br&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_4\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Miscellaneous Info&lt;/h2&gt;If you have information about this route that doesn\'t pertain to any of the other sections, please add it here.&lt;br&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_5\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Images&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div align=\"center\"&gt;&lt;table id=\"my_images\"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/heading-northwest-from-the/122407/c-166454\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Heading northwest from the...\" src=\"/images/square/122407.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/emerson-s-west-face-is-the/122405/c-166454\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Emerson\\\'s West Face is the...\" src=\"/images/square/122405.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/article&gt;date:difficulty:elevation:'),(226,166654,'/south-ridge/166654','/clyde-spires/151233','South Ridge','','','','','III',1870,37.14,-118.648,'California, United States, North America','','',151233,'Clyde Spires','Class 4','0.8','Scrambling','Spring, Summer, Fall','Most of a day','Route','content: &lt;article&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_1\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2 id=\"first_h2\"&gt;Approach&lt;/h2&gt;The South Ridge is the technically easiest route to the base of Clyde Spires, no more than class 3, and much of it class 2. It can be most easily reached from the south in the vicinity of the Pacific Crest Trail below Helen Lake, but the closest trailhead involves an approach from the north and over Echo Col, the route described here.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Lake Sabrina TH is located just east of the lake\'s outlet. There is parking for about 6-7 cars in three small lots near the trailhead. Overnight parking is a quarter mile down the road at the fork with the road to North Lake. Follow the trail to Blue Lake, Dingleberry Lake and then Sailor Lake for about 7 miles. Just past Sailor Lake and before reaching Hungry Packer Lake, leave the trail heading southeast to the west shore of Moonlight Lake, then south following the drainage to Echo Lakes. Clyde Spires towers above you to the southwest, the two gray towers on the right (further right is the redish brown, and higher Crumbly Spire).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;From Echo Lake\'s outlet, follow around the east side of the lake, traversing upwards through a cliff band (and a good amount of snow most likely, depending on season) to the cirque and small glacier in a bowl south of Echo Lakes. Cross the bowl heading southwest, aiming for the U-shaped notch on the right side known as Echo Col. The rock is class 3 leading up to Echo Col, class 2 on the southwest side. Except in early season, you can leave your snow gear at the col for your return.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Descend Echo Col for about 50 feet until you can begin traversing west across the bowl between the col and the South Ridge (class 2). Dropping down before climbing to the ridge may be less tedious than the traverse, depending on your preference. &lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;table class=\"inline_image_thumbs\"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=124688\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/124688.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=124686\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/124686.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=124687\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/124687.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_2\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Route Description&lt;/h2&gt;The South Ridge itself is mostly class 2, gains about 500ft, and for the most part not terribly exciting. Most of this section will be devoted to the summit spires which are the most interesting aspects of this route.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Once on the South Ridge, follow the ridge more or less straight up. The climbing difficulty will increase to class 3 in the upper part, and class 4-5 if you stay more directly on the ridge. The ridge leads directly to the East Spire. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;East Spire&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The East Spire is an impressive mass of granite and a fine summit, but hardly what can be termed a spire. It has more of a classic pyramid shape than anything remotely spire-shaped. There are at least three ways to climb the East Spire. The easiest is from the east, class 3. When climbing the South Ridge, stay to the right of the ridge near the summit and traverse around to the east side. A short knife-edge block is crossed and then large blocks to the summit. The first ascent party, led by Norman Clyde in 1933, climbed the East Spire from the west side, class 4. To reach the \"classic\" route, move to the left of the South Ridge as you near the top and climb to the notch just west of the East Spire. Secor describes this as a &lt;i&gt;difficult slab climb&lt;/i&gt;, and at first it is indeed intimidating. A steep ramp angles up to the north with the wall on the far side overhanging. A small ledge cuts the slab horizontally and is the key to ascending this lower section. Cross the ledge from right to left and climb the ramp on the easier outside edge. Flakes and cracks (with good holds) are used to scramble up the near vertical west face to the summit. A third option is to climb the South Ridge (itself having two sub-options) directly. The easiest of these is to climb nearly to the start of the east side, then climb a convenient two foot wide ramp that angles left back to the South Ridge and within 30 feet of the summit. Climb flakes with good holds to the summit (class 3-4). One can also climb the South Ridge directly - bypass the sharpest blocks on the ridge before the summit just to the right and climb class 4 blocks and slabs along the rounded uppermost part of the ridge to the summit (you\'ll intersect the ramp route when 30-40 feet from the summit).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;West Spire&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The West Spire is a classic spire, a single monolith rising some 30ft nearly vertical with a flat top about 3\' by 5\'. Without a convenient lower block that provides class 4 access, the spire would probably be rated at 5.9 or higher. The lower block is separated from the main block by a foot-wide chimney and can be reached from at least two sides. The easier side is from the east where a short climb up the chimney is followed by a mantle to stand atop the lower block. The chimney can alo be climbed from the west side via a vertical 8-foot lieback and then climbing into the chimney and up to the lower block. The top of the summit block is about shoulder level when standing on the lower block. Be warned that some good scramblers have called it a day at this point. Rock shoes can certainly make the final mantle easier, but they aren\'t required. This is the only move on the West Spire that has any serious exposure.&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;table class=\"inline_image_thumbs\"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=124689\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/124689.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=124690\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/124690.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=124691\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/124691.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=124692\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/124692.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=124693\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/124693.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_3\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Essential Gear&lt;/h2&gt;Crampons/axe may be needed for climbing above Echo Lake to Echo Col.

Camping spots and running water can be found along the way. I highly recommend going as far as possible (i.e. as close to the glacier as possible) to cut down on the approach time next day. Once you reach the end of the moraine, you will see Thunderbolt Peak in front of you.

The rock alternative is called Northeast Buttress in \"Climbing CA 14\'ers\".&lt;br&gt;&lt;div align=\"center\" class=\"image\" style=\"width: 206px;\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"/north-side-of-thunderbolt-peak/281613\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"north side of Thunderbolt Peak\" height=\"150\" width=\"200\" src=\"/images/small/281613.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=\"caption\"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div align=\"center\" class=\"image-left\" style=\"width: 106px;\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"/kris-climbing-through-the/131081\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Kris climbing through the...\" height=\"75\" width=\"100\" src=\"/images/thumb/131081.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=\"caption\"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br&gt;The North couloir is the wide couloir above large bergsrund (open later in the season) on the North Face of Thunderbolt. Whereas the \"easiest\" routes to the summit monolith are located on the west side, the &lt;a href=\"http://www.summitpost.org/route/157684/underhill-couloir-right-hand.html\"&gt;Underhill Couloir&lt;/a&gt; and North Couloir are the two least difficult routes approachable from the east. The North Couloir specifically offers a safe descent route after climbing a more technical route on the east side. We descended this route when returning from NE Couloir in early October 2005.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div align=\"center\" class=\"image-left\" style=\"width: 106px;\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"/part-way-up-north-couloir-of-thunderbolt/281609\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"part way up North Couloir of Thunderbolt\" height=\"75\" width=\"100\" src=\"/images/thumb/281609.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=\"caption\"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br&gt;The route is quite straightforward. The crux later in the season would be crossing the bergsrund - we were able to climb through, utilizing a snow bridge. In early October 2005 the route was mainly hard enjoyable neve, in late October 2006 it was neve with patches of water ice, and in March 2007 it was some neve but mostly powder snow - so be prepared for any conditions. Once above the berg, go up the left Y of the couloir and ultimately aiming for top at the climber\'s right of Lighting Rod. In late seasont the left Y of the couloir can be partially melted out leaving some scrambling over rocks or one can instead climb the right side of the Y and traverse over at top. The couloir is 1000 ft of approx. 30-40 degrees at most and takes about 1-1.5 hours to gain the upper northwest buttress.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div align=\"center\" class=\"image-left\" style=\"width: 106px;\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"/climbing-to-the-notch-between-the-two-thunderbolt-summits/281610\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Climbing to the notch between the two Thunderbolt summits\" height=\"75\" width=\"100\" src=\"/images/thumb/281610.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=\"caption\"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br&gt;Once you reach the northwest buttress, drop down approximately 50 feet on the west side. Traverse underneath the lightning rod by contouring on class 3/4 rock. Looking towards the notch between the lightning rod and the true summit is a obvious gulley - the end of the &lt;a href=\"http://www.summitpost.org/route/155568/southwest-chute-number-1.html\"&gt;SW chute No. 1 route&lt;/a&gt;. Take this to the notch between the two summits (rememberig the south summit is the true summit) and climb the south summit monilith via a class 4 chimney to the summit block.&lt;a name=\"chapter_3\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Essential Gear&lt;/h2&gt;Crampons, ice tools. Earlier in the season an ice axe may suffice but hard neve may be present on the bottom 200 ft of the couloir. If uncomfortable on steep snow, consider bringing rope and pickets. We were able to descend the route without any pro.&lt;br&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_4\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Miscellaneous Info&lt;/h2&gt;the essential no-BS-added beta for the route is:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;- Cross the berg on the left. Hopefully, there is enough snow to cover the crevasse.&lt;br&gt;- Shoot for the notch north of the lightning rod.&lt;br&gt;- Descend to the west side ~50 feet and traverse to the chute that takes you to the notch between the true summit and the lightning rod. Spicy if there is a lot of snow...&lt;br&gt;- Ascend class 4/5 (depends on who you talk to. I think it is 4) to the summit block. This might be the crux?&lt;br&gt;- Ascend class 5.9 summit block.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If you have information about this route that doesn\'t pertain to any of the other sections, please add it here.&lt;br&gt;&lt;div align=\"center\"&gt;&lt;a name=\"messages\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_5\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Additions and Corrections&lt;/h2&gt;[ &lt;a href=\"/object_discussion.php?type=vote_comments&amp;amp;object_id=167136&amp;amp;is_addition=1#vote_form\"&gt;Post an Addition or Correction&lt;/a&gt; ]&lt;table cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" style=\"width: 775px;\"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;table cellpadding=\"2\" cellspacing=\"2\" width=\"100%\"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;&lt;span class=\"pagertext\"&gt;Viewing: &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;-&lt;b&gt;5&lt;/b&gt; of &lt;b&gt;5&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td align=\"center\"&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td align=\"right\"&gt;    &lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;table border=\"0\" width=\"775\" class=\"messages\"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td width=\"110\" align=\"left\" valign=\"top\" style=\"padding-top: 6px;\"&gt;&lt;a name=\"146679\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a class=\"dis_user_lnk\" href=\"/users/lavaka/1341\"&gt;lavaka&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td valign=\"top\" style=\"padding-top: 6px;\"&gt;&lt;b&gt;North by NorthEast&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td align=\"right\" valign=\"top\" nowrap style=\"font-size: 10px;\"&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td valign=\"top\" rowspan=\"2\" align=\"left\" style=\"padding-top: 6px;\"&gt;&lt;p class=\"disc_avatar\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"/users/lavaka/1341\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"lavaka\" width=\"50\" height=\"50\" border=\"0\" src=\"/images/avatars/440574.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=\"font-size: 9px; color: #888;\"&gt;Voted 9/10&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td colspan=\"2\" style=\"padding-top: 6px;\"&gt;You\'re sure this is what Moynier and Fiddler call the \"NE\" couloir?  Because M &amp;amp; F rate it class 4-5 snow and ice, but I was up there in late August and, apart from getting past the bergschrund, it was low-angle snow, in accordance with what both Croft and Secor had led be to believe.  Looking at the M &amp;amp; F guidebook, their photo does show the line going up the N. couloir (and it agrees with their verbal description), but perhaps they\'re mistaken.  I haven\'t been on the left, NE couloir, but it sounds icy, and it would make sense if M &amp;amp; F really meant this one and simply made an error.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Have you been on both the N and NE couloirs?  Does the N. couloir really get icy?

Look at the picture in M&amp;amp;F High Sierra and they show the route up NE Couloir via the wide couloir right off the buttress that splits N and NE couloirs. This wide couloir (that I call North) DOES get ice, we encountered solid ice when descending it in mid-October 2005. When I went up this route in late July 2006, it was all snow and except for shrund it was quite easy. I agree that the 4-5 rating in M&amp;amp;F is overated, it is probably same or less steep than e.g. Dana Couloir.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I think Secor has this right, the wide one is North Couloir, the narrow one, which is steeper and was solid ice, is NE. Also, both M&amp;amp;F and Secor that first party descended this route (the wide North Couloir) on the first climb of the peak and there is no way (IMHO) that they would descend the narrow NE couloir, unless they were smoking something :-)Makes sense?&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td valign=\"bottom\" style=\"padding-top: 6px;\" colspan=\"2\"&gt;&lt;span style=\"font-size: 9px; color: #888;\"&gt;Posted Sep 13, 2006 5:41 am&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;table border=\"0\" width=\"775\" class=\"messages\"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td width=\"110\" align=\"left\" valign=\"top\" style=\"padding-top: 6px;\"&gt;&lt;a name=\"385185\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a class=\"dis_user_lnk\" href=\"/users/pellucidwombat/12893\"&gt;PellucidWombat&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td valign=\"top\" style=\"padding-top: 6px;\"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Take care&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td align=\"right\" valign=\"top\" nowrap style=\"font-size: 10px;\"&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td valign=\"top\" rowspan=\"2\" align=\"left\" style=\"padding-top: 6px;\"&gt;&lt;p class=\"disc_avatar\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"/users/pellucidwombat/12893\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"PellucidWombat\" width=\"50\" height=\"50\" border=\"0\" src=\"/images/avatars/833128.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=\"font-size: 9px; color: #888;\"&gt;Voted 10/10&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td colspan=\"2\" style=\"padding-top: 6px;\"&gt;to take the left fork before heading right!

Climbers usually belay from the bottom of the ramps.  I free soloed one that felt 5.5 or 5.6 but if you move left it\'s even easier. Beware of rope drag if you pitch out the bottom part. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;At the top of the ramp there\'s a ledge/notch (where we set up the first belay) below where the climb goes straight up. Follow easy cracks to the left of a large flake until you hit a small roof. Exit to the left onto some delicate but easy face climbing. This is the only 5.7 move on the first pitch of the climb. Face climb to some cracks and up into a cave where you can set up a belay.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Pitch 2 starts in the cave with a high hands traverse to the right. You can get gear into the crack above your head but don\'t worry too much: bomber handholds lead out to some wild exposure and a easy mantle move. This is the second 5.7 move on the route and the reason to do the climb. A few feet of moderate friction climbing and you\'re on top. A short pitch but super fun.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A single rope rap off bolts takes you to a ledge overlooking the parking lot and an easy scramble back to the ground.&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;table class=\"inline_image_thumbs\"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=137475\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/137475.JPG\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=137476\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/137476.JPG\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_3\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Essential Gear&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;br&gt;A small rack. &lt;br&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_4\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Miscellaneous Info&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;br&gt;If you have information about this route that doesn\'t pertain to any of the other sections, please add it here.&lt;br&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_5\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Images&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div align=\"center\"&gt;&lt;table id=\"my_images\"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/user-profile-image/578494/c-167674\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"User Profile Image\" src=\"/images/square/578494.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/kristina-on-the-super-fun/137475/c-167674\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\" Kristina on the super fun...\" src=\"/images/square/137475.JPG\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/intersection-rock-from-the/137478/c-167674\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\" Intersection Rock from the...\" src=\"/images/square/137478.JPG\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/kristina-belays-mike-on-the/137476/c-167674\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Kristina belays Mike on the...\" src=\"/images/square/137476.JPG\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/article&gt;date:'),(229,205503,'/sw-slopes/205503','/colosseum-mountain/197009','SW slopes','','','Class 2','','',1428,0,0,'California, United States, North America','','',197009,'Colosseum Mountain','','0.6','Scrambling','Spring, Summer, Fall, Winter','Less than two hours','Route','content: &lt;article&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_1\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2 id=\"first_h2\"&gt;Getting There&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;div align=\"center\" class=\"image-left\" style=\"width: 206px;\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"/sawmill-lake/205496\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Sawmill Lake\" height=\"150\" width=\"200\" src=\"/images/small/205496.JPG\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=\"caption\"&gt;Sawmill Lake, 1.5 miles below Sawmill Pass.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;The climb begins from upper Woods Lake Basin.  The most common way to get to Woods Lake Basin is via the Sawmill Pass Trail.  The Sawmill Pass Trail starts in the Owens Valley, at 4640\', and ascends almost 7000\' over 9.5 miles to beautiful Sawmill Pass (11,350\').  The trail is a grunt, to say the least.  However, most grumpiness will be From there you descend along the trail into the Woods Lake Basin.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For driving directions to the Sawmill Pass Trail, see: &lt;a href=\"http://www.climber.org/DrivingDirections/sawmill.html\"&gt;http://www.climber.org/DrivingDirections/sawmill.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The alternate way into the Woods Lake Basin is via the John Muir Trail, either north or south.  The Woods Lake Basin is to the east, between Pinchot Pass on the north, and Rae Lakes Basin on the south.&lt;a name=\"chapter_2\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Route Description&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;div align=\"center\" class=\"image-left\" style=\"width: 132px;\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"/southwest-slope-map/205497\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Southwest Slope Map\" height=\"200\" width=\"126\" src=\"/images/small/205497.JPG\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=\"caption\"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;Once in the Woods Lake Basin, you want to depart the trail somewhere near where it pops out of the woods on the east side of the basin.  Head north toward the two lakes, and bisect them (note: in early season, it may actually be one lake).  Head up to the next lip with a small tarn behind it, and fill up on water (this is the last water you\'ll see).  Then head directly towards the steep scree/talus cliffs to your east from this tarn-- this will put you on a higher level bench, which you can traverse to the north on.&lt;br&gt;&lt;div align=\"center\" class=\"image-right\" style=\"width: 206px;\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"/chockstone-chute-entrance/205498\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Chockstone Chute entrance\" height=\"152\" width=\"200\" src=\"/images/small/205498.JPG\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=\"caption\"&gt;The Chockstone Chute entrance, behind the large shining block, where the arrow is pointing.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As you traverse north, you will see chutes ascending through the cliff bands above.  There are any number of chutes you can take through the cliffs above you.  Wingding has pictures of one way &lt;a href=\"http://kathywing.smugmug.com/gallery/1578213/3/76458358\"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, however she\'s said that it\'s pretty loose.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Another way is via a Chockstone Chute.  This involves some nice class 2 on solid ground, with some optional fun class 3 on very solid rock.  Traverse further north along the base of the cliffs, and head for the chute as seen here:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Head up towards the entrance.  If care is taken, it\'s easy to stay on the larger talus blocks and avoid the horrid scree and sand.  Once behind the large shining block, you will have the following view up the chute:&lt;br&gt;&lt;div align=\"center\" class=\"image-left\" style=\"width: 206px;\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"/chockstone-chute/205499\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Chockstone Chute\" height=\"150\" width=\"200\" src=\"/images/small/205499.JPG\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=\"caption\"&gt;Looking up the Chockstone Chute (the chockstone can be clearly seen).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Head up to the chockstone.  You have two options: either climb directly over it using some class 4 holds on the left wall of the chute, or tunnel underneath the chock, and wriggle your way up behind it.  This is a fun little wriggle, but care must be taken that one is using solid rock for handholds, and not small blocks that have become stuck next to the chock.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div align=\"center\" class=\"image-right\" style=\"width: 156px;\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"/beyond-the-chockstone/205501\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Beyond the Chockstone\" height=\"200\" width=\"150\" src=\"/images/small/205501.JPG\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=\"caption\"&gt;Looking up chute beyond the chockstone.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It is easy going from here.  Head up the gully, ascending mixed talus and scree, using the walls on either side as handrails (and sometimes for good foot placements as well).  You can either continue all the way up to the summit plateau in the loose gully, or you can exit to the left on solid class 3 steps and blocks.  If you chose this option, gain the crest of the ridge to the north of the gully, and follow it on easy class 3 rock to the summit plateau.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Once on the summit plateau, hike along to the highpoint.  The higher summit is not the one with the benchmark on the map, but the west summit.  The views are outstanding.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For descent, one can either go down the way one came, or head down the west ridge of the plateau to the Colosseum/Cedric Wright saddle (all class 1), which then has easy cross-country travel back to Woods Lake.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There is also a nice &lt;a href=\"http://www.summitpost.org/route/165924/ne-ridge-from-cedric-colosseum-saddle.html\"&gt;class 3 ridge traverse&lt;/a&gt; from the Colosseum/Cedric Wright saddle to &lt;a href=\"http://www.summitpost.org/mountain/rock/154375/mount-cedric-wright.html\"&gt;Mt. Cedric Wright&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Note: Time Required is from the Woods Lake Basin.  From Sawmill Pass it is either one REALLY long day, or multiple days.                                                                                                         &lt;a name=\"chapter_3\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Images&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div align=\"center\"&gt;&lt;table id=\"my_images\"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/colosseum-mtn-routes-photo-topo/667433/c-205503\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Colosseum Mtn Routes (Photo Topo)\" src=\"/images/square/667433.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/sawmill-lake/205496/c-205503\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Sawmill Lake\" src=\"/images/square/205496.JPG\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/southwest-slope-map/205497/c-205503\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Southwest Slope Map\" src=\"/images/square/205497.JPG\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/chockstone-chute-entrance/205498/c-205503\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Chockstone Chute entrance\" src=\"/images/square/205498.JPG\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/chockstone-chute/205499/c-205503\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Chockstone Chute\" src=\"/images/square/205499.JPG\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/beyond-the-chockstone/205501/c-205503\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Beyond the Chockstone\" src=\"/images/square/205501.JPG\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/article&gt;date:'),(230,234383,'/aquaknobby/234383','/pywiack-dome/152754','Aquaknobby','','','','','II',1687,0,0,'','','3',152754,'Pywiack Dome','5.9 (YDS)','0.8923076923076924','Trad Climbing','Summer','','Route','content: &lt;article&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_1\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2 id=\"first_h2\"&gt;Overview&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;i&gt;Aquaknobby&lt;/i&gt; is a three-pitch trad climb on cracks and knobs.

The climb\'s moderate difficulty, short easy approach, and proximity to Salt Lake City make this one of the more popular ice climbs to be found in the area.&lt;a name=\"chapter_2\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Getting There&lt;/h2&gt;The Great White Icicle is located on the south side of Little Cottonwood Canyon, just south of the small powerplant approximately 2 miles from the mouth of the canyon.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;To get there, from the 6200 South exit (exit #6) off I-215 follow highway 190 south-east approximately 2 miles to the intersection with Big Cottonwood Canyon road. Continue straight through the stoplight and follow the road another 4 miles to the mouth of Little Cottonwood Canyon, where an electronic billboard on the right provides current road and/or weather conditions.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;From the electronic billboard drive 1.9 miles east up Little Cottonwood Canyon, to the powerplant located next to the stream on the south side of the road. A small parking is located directly to the west of the powerplant.&lt;a name=\"chapter_3\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Approach&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;div align=\"center\" class=\"image-right\" style=\"width: 156px;\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"/great-white-icicle-p3/248610\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Great White Icicle - P3\" height=\"200\" width=\"150\" src=\"/images/small/248610.JPG\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=\"caption\"&gt;Pitch 3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br&gt;From the parking area cross the bridge over the stream and hike a short distance south to the main east-west trail which parallels the stream.  Head west a short distance, then look for a hiker\'s trail heading south towards the base of the climb.  This is a popular climb so an obvious track will usually be present, but if not, the climb is partially visible through the trees and is easy to locate.  Total distance from the parking area to the base of the climb is around 5-minutes.&lt;a name=\"chapter_4\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Route Description&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;div align=\"center\" class=\"image-left\" style=\"width: 156px;\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"/great-white-icicle-p3-belay/248611\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Great White Icicle - P3 Belay\" height=\"200\" width=\"150\" src=\"/images/small/248611.JPG\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=\"caption\"&gt;Top of P3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Pitch 1&lt;/b&gt; - From a good belay spot in the trees, move out onto a slab and climb &plusmn;30 feet on thin ice (probably not protectable), then move onto easier low angle terrain for a few dozen feet to a good belay spot at the base of pitch 2.  There may be bolts at this belay, but I didn\'t see them.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Pitch 2&lt;/b&gt; - Pitch 2 ascends a long narrow gully of &plusmn;45&deg;.  Near the top of the gully the angle decreases, then move towards the left (east) wall to a bolted belay.  This is a relatively long pitch; depending on rope length being used, the belayer may need to begin climbing before the leader reaches the belay at the top of P2.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Pitch 3&lt;/b&gt; - Pitch 3 ascends the broad bulging face which reaches &plusmn;60&deg; near the center.  The bulge may be climbed at any number of locations on the face.  The top of P3 is located on a small sloping ledge on the right (west) wall, which contains 2 sets of bolted anchors.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Pitch 4&lt;/b&gt; - This is the crux pitch; from the belay at the top of P3 move upwards on easy terrain for a few dozen feet.  The angle increases near the top, approaching &plusmn;80&deg; as it ascends the top of the headwall.  Depending on conditions there may be significant water flow through this section.  Above the headwall move up another 20-30 feet on easy terrain to a suitable belay.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Note:  If desired P4 may be split into two pitches; to do so, look for a bolted belay in an alcove on the right (west) wall, approximately 80-feet above the P3 belay.&lt;br&gt;&lt;div align=\"center\" class=\"image-right\" style=\"width: 156px;\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"/great-white-icicle-in-summer/248613\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Great White Icicle in Summer\" height=\"200\" width=\"150\" src=\"/images/small/248613.JPG\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=\"caption\"&gt;Summer View&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_5\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Descent&lt;/h2&gt;From the belay at the top of P4, scramble a short distance up and to the west, then traverse west &plusmn;100 feet into the prominent gulley immediately to the west of the climb.

It\'s on the left side of the base of a buttress that is not very distinct. On the right side of the buttress is a fourth class walk up to the start of the Nose 75\' above. Look for a small pine right above the point of this prow. Work 100\' around to the left and find the big ledge that leads to the up to the base of the climb. The ledge is not obvious until you are starting up it, it\'s hard to see from the ledge from below. There is one obvious piton scarred crack. Climb with fingers in the piton scars. It is a bit hard to set pro because the scars are all flaring. It takes 3 or 4 small cams. There are a few much harder lines right along side, so you can use Pine Line to set up a top rope and work on the harder ones. Or just keep going up, the right side walk up and Pine line come together just above the pine, if you are all fired up, you should finish the nose in one to seven days. See the pic for a look at the crack and pine from where you get to the base of El Cap. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_3\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Pro and Anchors&lt;/h2&gt;posted by PellucidWombat &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Pro &amp;amp; Anchors &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The entire route can be led with nuts, and I actually found it easier to find nut placements than cams.

This was followed by Ken Davis and Jack Riegelhuth in August 1938, who traversed from Mount Winchelll to North Palisade in 13 hours.  According to Porcella and Burns, the first known Thunderbolt to Sill traverse was completed by &lt;a href=\"http://www.ucmcpioneers.org/JOHN%20OHRENSCHALL%20page.html\" target=\"blank\"&gt;John Ohrenschall&lt;/a&gt; and John Mathias in 1958 over two days.  This same pair made the first ascent of the &lt;a href=\"http://www.summitpost.org/route/157052/v-notch-couloir.html\" target=\"blank\"&gt;V-notch&lt;/a&gt; two day later.&lt;br&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_2\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Getting There&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Direction&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;The traditional way is to do this from Thunderbolt to Sill, but having done both directions I like Sill to Thunderbolt better.  It has more technical climbing than the opposite direction if you start on the &lt;a href=\"http://www.summitpost.org/swiss-ar-te/156548\" target=\"blank\"&gt;Swiss Arete&lt;/a&gt; and it makes the most sense if you start/end at Glacier Lodge.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;To Shuttle or Not to Shuttle&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;The traverse may be approached from either the South Lake or Glacier Lodge trailheads. One option is set up a car shuttle starting at South Lake and ending at Glacier Lodge.  The advantage is that you can haul ass up Bishop Pass, which is a relatively easy trail, and you don&rsquo;t have to circumnavigate the ridge to the SW to get back to your car.  The disadvantage is that you have to deal with the shuttle logistics on the way there and back.  It&rsquo;s ~53 miles between Bishop Pass and Glacier Lodge.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I have now done the whole traverse car-to-car from the Bishop Pass trailhead and Sill to Starlight (downclimbing Underhill Couloir) car-to-car from Glacier Lodge.  The latter is by far the most direct way and is my preferred option over shuttling.  If you\'re feeling extra perky you can start on Temple Crag and continue on to Galey, then Sill to T-bolt (highly recommended).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;From South Lake&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://maps.google.com/maps?f=d&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;geocode=&amp;amp;saddr=&amp;amp;daddr=37.172902,-118.564796&amp;amp;mra=mi&amp;amp;mrsp=0&amp;amp;sz=12&amp;amp;sll=37.214199,-118.458023&amp;amp;sspn=0.137528,0.32135&amp;amp;ie=UTF8&amp;amp;z=12&amp;amp;om=0\" target=\"blank\"&gt;Google maps&lt;/a&gt;.

From the trailhead follow the well-maintained trail to the crest of Bishop Pass (8 miles).  The lake near the crest is a good place to top off your water.  From the Pass leave the trail and head SW along the base of the Palisade Crest.  SW Chute #1 starts just after Thunderbolt Pass.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;From Glacier Lodge&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;geocode=&amp;amp;q=map+glacier+lodge,+big+pine,+ca&amp;amp;sll=37.0625,-95.677068&amp;amp;sspn=34.999041,82.265625&amp;amp;ie=UTF8&amp;amp;ll=37.129119,-118.407211&amp;amp;spn=0.137683,0.32135&amp;amp;z=12&amp;amp;iwloc=addr&amp;amp;om=0\" target=\"blank\"&gt;Google maps&lt;/a&gt;.

Note that at Glacier Lodge you have to park in the overnight backpackers&rsquo; lot (0.7 miles away from the TH) or pay $5 at the Lodge store unless you expect to daytrip.  From the trailhead take the dirt road.   At 0.25 miles you will reach the S Fork/N Fork junction.  Continue on the N Fork trail past Third Lake to Sam Mack Meadow (~1 mile past the lake).  This marks the start of the Thunderbolt eastern access routes (~8 miles) noted above.  Top off your water in the stream if needed. &lt;br&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_3\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Route Description&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Thunderbolt Peak (14,003 ft)&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;The most popular route up Thunderbolt, as described by &lt;a href=\"http://www.summitpost.org/user_page.php?user_id=185\" target=\"blank\"&gt;Romain&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"http://www.summitpost.org/user_page.php?user_id=10534\" target=\"blank\"&gt;Matthew&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"http://www.summitpost.org/user_page.php?user_id=276\" target=\"blank\"&gt;Bob B&lt;/a&gt;, is the &lt;a href=\"http://www.summitpost.org/route/155568/southwest-chute-number-1.html\" target=\"blank\"&gt;SW Chute #1&lt;/a&gt; (Class 3 + 5.8 &lt;a href=\"http://www.summitpost.org/route/156888/the-summit-block.html\" target=\"blank\"&gt;summit block&lt;/a&gt;), which is accessed via the S Lake trailhead.

We stayed on the NW side of the ridge and encountered a wide gap with an overhanging boulder problem with some major exposure.  The first time we rapped across the gap using existing rap slings.  I went back to find a way to solo this section.  There are several options for downclimbing into the notch on the SE side of the ridge (thanks to &lt;a href=\"http://www.summitpost.org/user_page.php?user_id=1341\" target=\"blank\"&gt;lavaka&lt;/a&gt; for the suggestion).  I went down an exposed flake system on the SE side of the ridge.  From the notch you can either climb a lie back (maybe one or two committing moves to reach a bomber foothold) or climb up a ramp on a mini version of Starlight to reach the ledge.&lt;br&gt;&lt;div align=\"center\" class=\"image-left\" style=\"width: 156px;\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"/en-route-to-sill/322853\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"en route to sill\" height=\"200\" width=\"150\" src=\"/images/small/322853.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=\"caption\"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Polemonium Peak (14,080 ft)&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Follow a reverse of the instructions (from &lt;a href=\"http://www.summitpost.org/user_page.php?user_id=185\" target=\"blank\"&gt;Romain&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"http://www.summitpost.org/user_page.php?user_id=16949\" target=\"blank\"&gt;Steve Larson&lt;/a&gt;) found &lt;a href=\"http://www.summitpost.org/route/155564/u-notch-chimney-variation.html\" target=\"blank\"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; for the North Palisade Chimney route (5.2) from the summit to the U-notch.

If you are parked at S Lake, the easiest (in terms of technical difficulty) route it to drop off the SW side of Sill (Class 2-3) and follow the base of the (long) ridge back to Bishop Pass.  If Glacier Lodge is your destination take either the L-shaped couloir or Glacier Notch routes.  For the former, descend the W Ridge of Sill to the L-shaped couloir.  From the colouir head down to Palisade Glacier, aiming for the right side of the glacial tarn.  Having crampons (and an ice axe) will help if conditions are icy.  From here head onto the benches.  You will find use trails heading NW toward Sam Mack Lake.  From Sam Mack Meadow cross the bridge and catch the N Fork of the Big Pine Creek Trail.  For the latter drop down to the saddle between Sill and Galey (Glacier Notch) and skirt the  W side of the NW ridge of Galey, joining up the the L-shaped couloir descent route on the benches above the tarn.&lt;a name=\"chapter_4\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Essentials&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Water&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Opportunity to fill up at the stream in Sam Mack Meadow or the lake near the top of Bishop Pass.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Gear to Consider&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;li&gt;rope (a 50-60m makes things a lot easier/faster v. down climbing and it\'s helpful to protect the 5.8 moves required to gain the summit blocks of Thunderbolt and Starlight; also allows for a quick escape should the weather turn; could get by with a 30m)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;li&gt;slings&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;li&gt;carabiners&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;li&gt;harness/rap device&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;li&gt;approach shoes with sticky rubber and/or rock shoes&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;li&gt;alpine rack&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;li&gt;crampons if planning to descend the couloir in icy conditions&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;li&gt;ice axe&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;li&gt;helmet (this is a busy area, plus there may be rockfall as the temps warm up and the ice melts)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;li&gt;rap ring(s)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_5\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Backcountry Camping&lt;/h2&gt;If you are relatively fast, both on the trail and on technical terrain, you can probably day trip this.  This means you should be comfortable soloing most, if not all of the route.  Good camping is found around Sam Mack Meadow, on the benches below Palisade Glacier and in Palisade Basin.  Note that water in the Palisade Glacier tarn can be extremely silty so consider bringing something to screen out the grit if you don&rsquo;t want to trash your pricey water filter or drink treated sludge.

I made an anchor at the top, which barely reaches the ledge with a 70m rope. If you start below the first steep section, there are some old solid pitons that could be reinforced for an anchor that could work with a 60m rope. The bottom is very steep, so take care not to rappel with a rope that is too short!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Also, in the event that you want to bail down the Underhill Couloir, it has good and new rappel stations.&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td valign=\"bottom\" style=\"padding-top: 6px;\" colspan=\"2\"&gt;&lt;span style=\"font-size: 9px; color: #888;\"&gt;Posted Jul 23, 2010 5:29 pm&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;table border=\"0\" width=\"745\" class=\"messages\" style=\"margin-left: 30px;\"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td rowspan=\"4\" valign=\"top\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/styles/layout/reply_arrow.gif\"&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td width=\"110\" align=\"left\" valign=\"top\" style=\"padding-top: 6px;\"&gt;&lt;a name=\"385916\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a class=\"dis_user_lnk\" href=\"/users/fossana/16743\"&gt;fossana&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td valign=\"top\" style=\"padding-top: 6px;\"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Re: Rappel Stations&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td align=\"right\" valign=\"top\" nowrap style=\"font-size: 10px;\"&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td valign=\"top\" rowspan=\"2\" align=\"left\" style=\"padding-top: 6px;\"&gt;&lt;p class=\"disc_avatar\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"/users/fossana/16743\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"fossana\" width=\"50\" height=\"50\" border=\"0\" src=\"/images/avatars/836259.JPG\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=\"font-size: 9px; color: #888;\"&gt;Hasn\'t voted&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td colspan=\"2\" style=\"padding-top: 6px;\"&gt;thanks, Mark.

Approach is more difficult than from S Lake but the Swiss Arete goes quickly.  The notch between N Pal &amp;amp; Starlight wasn\'t too bad in the opposite direction. I dropped down into the chimney on the N Pal side then downclimbed a lieback crack to reach the bottom of the notch.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Underhill is a fairly quick descent to the glacier, but full of silt &amp;amp; loose rock. Take care if you have a partner with you or there are other parties below.  The trail from Galey Camp is challenging to follow in the dark. I ended up blindly bushwhacking down to the Third Lake inlet (shorter than going back to Sam Mack).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Still undecided about whether C2C from S Lake or Glacier Lodge is harder.  The difference is the bulk of the talus slog from S Lake is at the end while it\'s half/half for Glacier.&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td valign=\"bottom\" style=\"padding-top: 6px;\" colspan=\"2\"&gt;&lt;span style=\"font-size: 9px; color: #888;\"&gt;Posted Sep 29, 2010 1:05 am&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;table border=\"0\" width=\"745\" class=\"messages\" style=\"margin-left: 30px;\"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td rowspan=\"4\" valign=\"top\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/styles/layout/reply_arrow.gif\"&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td width=\"110\" align=\"left\" valign=\"top\" style=\"padding-top: 6px;\"&gt;&lt;a name=\"473293\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a class=\"dis_user_lnk\" href=\"/users/fossana/16743\"&gt;fossana&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td valign=\"top\" style=\"padding-top: 6px;\"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Re: in reverse notes&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td align=\"right\" valign=\"top\" nowrap style=\"font-size: 10px;\"&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td valign=\"top\" rowspan=\"2\" align=\"left\" style=\"padding-top: 6px;\"&gt;&lt;p class=\"disc_avatar\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"/users/fossana/16743\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"fossana\" width=\"50\" height=\"50\" border=\"0\" src=\"/images/avatars/836259.JPG\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=\"font-size: 9px; color: #888;\"&gt;Hasn\'t voted&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td colspan=\"2\" style=\"padding-top: 6px;\"&gt;As noted above my preferred approach/direction is now Glacier Lodge to the Swiss Arete to T-bolt.

The fastest way to do that direction is the Swiss Arete to Tbolt then down Underhill, which could be even more sketchy than usual with the recent freeze/thaw cycles. Be careful. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The fastest I\'ve done the climbing part (that I know of) was 7 hrs from the base of the Swiss Arete to the base of Underhill, but that: 1) was after I\'d also done Temple and Galey; and 2) included time to help some less experienced guys routefind from N Pal to Underhill. If I had to take a wild guess I would say plan on 18-20 hours C2C for your first time.  The Swiss Arete goes super fast (1 hr or less if you\'re soloing).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The ridgeline is fairly convoluted so I don\'t really have any detailed beta to point to, unfortunately.  I have a few more photos on my &lt;a href=\"http://www.supertopo.com/tr/Temple-to-Thunderbolt-Traverse-5-9-V-C2C-Finding-solace-in-plan-B/t11718n.html\"&gt;TR&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Have fun!&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td valign=\"bottom\" style=\"padding-top: 6px;\" colspan=\"2\"&gt;&lt;span style=\"font-size: 9px; color: #888;\"&gt;Posted May 11, 2015 7:56 pm&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;table border=\"0\" width=\"775\"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;table cellpadding=\"2\" cellspacing=\"2\" width=\"100%\"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;&lt;span class=\"pagertext\"&gt;Viewing: &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;-&lt;b&gt;10&lt;/b&gt; of &lt;b&gt;10&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td align=\"center\"&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td align=\"right\"&gt;    &lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_9\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Images&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div align=\"center\"&gt;&lt;table id=\"my_images\"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/milk-bottle/477005/c-378567\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Milk Bottle\" src=\"/images/square/477005.JPG\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/summit-block/438258/c-378567\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"summit block\" src=\"/images/square/438258.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/en-route-to-sill/322853/c-378567\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"en route to sill\" src=\"/images/square/322853.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/exposure/326008/c-378567\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Exposure\" src=\"/images/square/326008.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/palisade-glacier/322850/c-378567\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"palisade glacier\" src=\"/images/square/322850.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/palisades-glacier-in-the-winter/582681/c-378567\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Palisades Glacier in the winter\" src=\"/images/square/582681.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/partners-in-crime/326012/c-378567\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"partners in crime\" src=\"/images/square/326012.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/starting-up-pol/322846/c-378567\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"starting up pol\" src=\"/images/square/322846.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/palisade-basin/326015/c-378567\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"palisade basin\" src=\"/images/square/326015.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/brett-atop-thunderbolt/477009/c-378567\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Brett Atop Thunderbolt\" src=\"/images/square/477009.JPG\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/polemonium-traverse/477013/c-378567\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Polemonium Traverse\" src=\"/images/square/477013.JPG\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/descending-t-bolt/322848/c-378567\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"descending t-bolt\" src=\"/images/square/322848.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/polemonium-peak-north-palisade-and-starlight/616227/c-378567\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Polemonium Peak, North Palisade and Starlight\" src=\"/images/square/616227.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/palisade-glacier/322849/c-378567\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"palisade glacier\" src=\"/images/square/322849.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td colspan=\"7\" align=\"center\"&gt;[ &lt;a href=\"/thunderbolt-to-sill-traverse/images/p-378567\"&gt;View Gallery - 77 More Images&lt;/a&gt; ]&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/article&gt;date:difficulty:elevation:'),(234,410106,'/lassen-peak-trail-southeast-ridge/410106','/california-cascades/334003','Lassen Peak Trail (Southeast Ridge)','','','Class 1','','',15094,40.4878,-121.504,'California, United States, North America','','',334003,'California Cascades','','0.6','Hiking','Summer, Fall','Half a day','Route','content: &lt;article&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_1\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2 id=\"first_h2\"&gt;Overview&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;div align=\"center\" class=\"image-left\" style=\"width: 206px;\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"/during-the-summer-months/1626\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"During the summer months...\" height=\"150\" width=\"200\" src=\"/images/small/1626.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=\"caption\"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;UPDATE (08 Sep 2009)&lt;/b&gt;: This trail is currently closed by the NPS due to a rockslide up the trail. Thanks to &lt;a href=\"http://www.summitpost.org/user_page.php?user_id=39495\"&gt;daw37&lt;/a&gt; for this update!!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The standard route up to the summit is the 2.5 mile (one-way) Lassen Peak Trail. This Class 1 route asends the Southeast Ridge to the 10,457\' summit from the 8,500\' Lassen Peak trailhead. Just below the summit, you can opt for a brief Class 3 variation.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Please note that during times of years when snow is not covering the ground, hiking off trail is discouraged due to the loose ash and scree.  If snow is present (Winter &amp;amp; Spring), then you can climb basically anywhere up the &lt;a href=\"http://www.summitpost.org/route/155692/south-face.html\"&gt;South Face&lt;/a&gt; rather than sticking to the tourist trail, which tends to follow the ridge. Beware of avalanche terrain, though.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_2\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Getting There&lt;/h2&gt;LASSEN PEAK TRAILHEAD FROM NORTH: To reach this summer trailhead, leave I-5 at Redding heading East on California SR-44. Continue South on to California SR-89 at the junction and drive another 22 miles past the Manzanita Lake park entrance to the trailhead.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;LASSEN PEAK TRAILHEAD FROM SOUTH: Leave I-5 at Red Bluff heading East on California SR-36 towards Mineral. Turn north at the SR-89 junction and continue 12 miles into the park to reach the trailhead.&lt;a name=\"chapter_3\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Route Description&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;div align=\"center\" class=\"image-right\" style=\"width: 206px;\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"/part-of-the-crowd-atop-lassen/257178\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Part of the crowd atop Lassen\" height=\"150\" width=\"200\" src=\"/images/small/257178.JPG\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=\"caption\"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br&gt;The trail is fairly straight-forward with several switchbacks leading up the slopes of the mountain. Any spot in the trail where one might easily wander off-route has low rock barriers to keep you on-track.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Park benches and interpretive signs line the path as well, providing frequent spots for respite along the way. You can also look forward to the snow cone stand at the north end of the crater rim.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Ok, so I\'m kidding about the snow cone stand, but there is a weather station on top...&lt;a name=\"chapter_4\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Essential Gear&lt;/h2&gt;Assuming you\'re climbing during the regular season, only normal hiking &amp;amp; safety gear (The Ten Essentials) is required. Be sure to bring enough water for your climb as the area can be quite warm and dry during the middle of summer.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Given the gravely nature of the trail, hiking boots or gaiters might help to keep the scree out of your shoes.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div align=\"center\" class=\"image\" style=\"width: 506px;\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"/lassen-trail-1/336747\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Lassen trail 1\" height=\"375\" width=\"500\" src=\"/images/medium/336747.JPG\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=\"caption\"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;                     &lt;a name=\"chapter_5\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Images&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div align=\"center\"&gt;&lt;table id=\"my_images\"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/during-the-summer-months/1626/c-410106\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"During the summer months...\" src=\"/images/square/1626.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/part-of-the-crowd-atop-lassen/257178/c-410106\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Part of the crowd atop Lassen\" src=\"/images/square/257178.JPG\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/not-the-lassen-trail/971244/c-410106\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"not the lassen trail\" src=\"/images/square/971244.JPG\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/user-profile-image/488061/c-410106\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"User Profile Image\" src=\"/images/square/488061.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/lassen-plug/493055/c-410106\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Lassen Plug\" src=\"/images/square/493055.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/beauty-on-lassen-peak/489627/c-410106\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Beauty on Lassen Peak\" src=\"/images/square/489627.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/lassen-switchbacks/493057/c-410106\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Lassen Switchbacks\" src=\"/images/square/493057.JPG\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/lake-helen-from-the-trail/971086/c-410106\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Lake Helen from the trail\" src=\"/images/square/971086.JPG\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/ashy-volcanic-rock/971048/c-410106\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"ashy volcanic rock\" src=\"/images/square/971048.JPG\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/lassen-summit/971049/c-410106\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Lassen summit\" src=\"/images/square/971049.JPG\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/lassen-trail-1/336747/c-410106\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Lassen trail 1\" src=\"/images/square/336747.JPG\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/lassen-trail-3/336749/c-410106\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Lassen trail 3\" src=\"/images/square/336749.JPG\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/shasta-from-lassen/971053/c-410106\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Shasta from Lassen\" src=\"/images/square/971053.JPG\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/se-bowl-of-lassen/971056/c-410106\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"SE bowl of Lassen\" src=\"/images/square/971056.JPG\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td colspan=\"7\" align=\"center\"&gt;[ &lt;a href=\"/lassen-peak-trail-southeast-ridge/images/p-410106\"&gt;View Gallery - 8 More Images&lt;/a&gt; ]&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/article&gt;date:'),(235,471705,'/goat-pass/471705','','Goat Pass','','','Class 2','','',4217,0,0,'Alberta, Canada, North America','','',0,'','','0.6','Hiking','','Half a day','Route','content: &lt;article&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_1\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2 id=\"first_h2\"&gt;Overview&lt;/h2&gt;This route is perhaps best used as an alternate descent route of Mt.

Then just follow whatever use trails you can link up to reach the saddle!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;From the saddle it is a straightforward boulder-hop to the summit.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If descending the route from the summit, just follow the main ridge toward Niblock. Initially it looks like the route cliffs out, but just as you reach the edge, more slope appears. This is pretty much the same all the way down into the Niblock-Whyte Cirque from Goat Pass.&lt;br&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_4\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Essential Gear&lt;/h2&gt;Trail runners.

Take the trail to Sam Mack Meadows and climb the right-hand chute (cl. 2-3), bypassing a large boulder on the right. This section can have a lot of water and some ice buildup in later season, and sometimes the easier variations involve climbing through spaces in the rocks. Next, follow the series of slabs in the drainage as you make your way to the Thunderbolt Glacier. When you reach the first lake at 11,790\', follow a series of ledges on the left side of the lake to get across the cliffs.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Once you reach the terminal moraine of the Thunderbolt Glacier, the rest of the way to Mt. Winchell should be apparent. Just boulder-hop along the right (north) lateral moraine of the glacier until you reach the base of the route.&lt;a name=\"chapter_3\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Route Description&lt;/h2&gt;Viewed from the Thunderbolt Glacier, climb the righthand chute. It is entered most easily by the far right side and then traversing back into the center. As you ascend higher the rock becomes less loose and scrambling is straightforward class 3 on slabs and ledges.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div align=\"center\" class=\"image\" style=\"width: 206px;\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"/looking-down-the-e-arete-of-mt-winchell/90633\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Looking down the E Arete of Mt Winchell\" height=\"150\" width=\"200\" src=\"/images/small/90633.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=\"caption\"&gt;Looking down the East Arete near the top.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As you ascend higher in the chute, ascend to the right to intersect the crest of the East Arete. The arete is knife-edged with some fun exposure. As the arete becomes very thin and exposed, escape back into a chute to the left and ascend the chute, wrapping slightly around to the south side of the peak.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The views from the summit are spectacular.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div align=\"center\" class=\"image\" style=\"width: 444px;\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"/routes-on-the-se-side-of-mt-winchell/634371\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Routes on the SE Side of Mt Winchell\" height=\"500\" width=\"438\" src=\"/images/medium/634371.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=\"caption\"&gt;The East Arete route seen from Temple Crag.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div align=\"center\" class=\"image\" style=\"width: 506px;\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"/routes-on-the-se-side-of-mt-winchell/634374\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Routes on the SE Side of Mt Winchell\" height=\"270\" width=\"500\" src=\"/images/medium/634374.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=\"caption\"&gt;The East Arete route seen from the North Couloir of Thunderbolt Pk.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div align=\"center\" class=\"image\" style=\"width: 506px;\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"/routes-on-the-se-side-of-mt-winchell/634373\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Routes on the SE Side of Mt Winchell\" height=\"332\" width=\"500\" src=\"/images/medium/634373.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=\"caption\"&gt;The East Arete route seen from the Thunderbolt Glacier.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_4\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Essential Gear&lt;/h2&gt;A helmet is recommended.

Robinson is a high quality route that should be done more often. Though it doesn\'t gain much elevation, it is an enjoyable ridge scramble with quality moves and rock, high exposure, and complex routefinding. The views are excellent as well and the many hidden catwalks that offer passage through vertical terrain are fun to stitch together. I\'d rank it as one of my favorite scrambles in the Sierra.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The rating is class 3 to easy 4th if you stay on route. If you get off route, it can easily become 4th to 5th class. The route took us just over an hour to do to the summit, about 2 hours round trip.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div align=\"center\" class=\"image\" style=\"width: 506px;\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"/mt-robinson-west-ridge-map/641143\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Mt Robinson West Ridge Map\" height=\"472\" width=\"500\" src=\"/images/medium/641143.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=\"caption\"&gt;A topographic map showing the West Ridge route on Mt Robinson from the common approaches via Sam Mack Meadows or a camp on the Palisade Glacier moraine.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;noformat&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;table border=\"1\" cellspacing=\"0\"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt; &lt;table border=\"0\" cellspacing=\"2\" cellpadding=\"2\"&gt;&lt;tr bgcolor=\"#c0c0c0\"&gt;&lt;td colspan=\"6\"&gt;&lt;font style=\"font-weight:bold;\"&gt; &lt;/font&gt;&lt;center&gt;Mt Robinson - West Ridge: Route Stats&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td align=\"center\"&gt;&lt;font style=\"font-weight:bold;\"&gt;RT Total&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td align=\"center\"&gt;&lt;font style=\"font-weight:bold;\"&gt;Total to Summit&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td align=\"center\"&gt;&lt;i&gt;TH to Sam Mack Meadows&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td align=\"center\"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Sam Mack (or Palisade Glacier Camp) &lt;br&gt;to Route&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td align=\"center\"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Route&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;b&gt;Distance (miles)&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td align=\"center\"&gt;16.26&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td align=\"center\"&gt;8.13&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td align=\"center\"&gt;&lt;i&gt;6.93&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td align=\"center\"&gt;&lt;i&gt;0.81 (1.34)&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td align=\"center\"&gt;&lt;i&gt;0.39&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr bgcolor=\"#e0e0e0\"&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;b&gt;Elevation Gain (ft)&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td align=\"center\"&gt;5,589&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td align=\"center\"&gt;5,090&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td align=\"center\"&gt;&lt;i&gt;3,565&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td align=\"center\"&gt;&lt;i&gt;858 (600)&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td align=\"center\"&gt;&lt;i&gt;667*&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;b&gt;Elevation Loss (ft)&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td align=\"center\"&gt;5,589&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td align=\"center\"&gt;499&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td align=\"center\"&gt;&lt;i&gt;242&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td align=\"center\"&gt;&lt;i&gt;57 (460)&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td align=\"center\"&gt;&lt;i&gt;200*&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td colspan=\"6\"&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;i&gt;Estimates from Topo!, which tends to slightly overestimate elevation, underestimate mileage, and ignores small-scale additions to mileage and elevation changes.&lt;br&gt;Totals are for the full climb via Sam Mack Meadows only.&lt;br&gt;*Estimated from gross elevation gain and assumed gain and loss on route&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/noformat&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_2\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Getting There&lt;/h2&gt;Approach via North Fork of Big Pine from the Glacier Lodge trailhead. Take the trail to Sam Mack Meadows and climb the right-hand chute (cl. 2-3), bypassing a large boulder on the right. This section can have a lot of water and some ice buildup in later season, and sometimes the easier variations involve climbing through spaces in the rocks. Next, follow the series of slabs in the drainage as you make your way to the Thunderbolt Glacier. When you reach the first lake at 11,790\', ascend towards the right, passing Sam Mack Lake on your right as you aim for the saddle between the E Ridge of Mt. Agassiz and the W Ridge of Mt. Robinson. The route starts here.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Another option could be to hike to 5th Lake and then head cross-country up the drainage that empties there. This may be a bit more distance, but not as steep. This might not be as good as it looks to require a lot more boulder-hopping, while the former approach has a lot of nice travel on slabs and meadow.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Though it is a bit of a trek, if you\'re camped out on the moraine of the Palisade Glacier, you can just traverse on moraines towards the saddle, making this route a nice one to do if you\'re already camped out in the area for some other climbs. It could be a good pre-climb acclimatization outing, done on the same day as the approach to camp. There is some elevation gain and loss, but it\'s not too bad. Expect 1-1.5 hours to traverse to the route from the north (right) lateral moraine of the Palisade Glacier if there isn\'t snow covering the rocks. Great snow cover should make the approach faster.&lt;a name=\"chapter_3\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Route Description&lt;/h2&gt;Due to the complexity of the route, I\'ve kept things simple by describing it in numbered sections that correspond to the annotated photo below.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In general, the route follows the south side of the ridge.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Begin ascending the ridge from the saddle. As the ridge becomes more rugged, gradually veer right (south) to traverse a system of broken ramps/ledges about 50 ft below the crest. Stay lower to avoid section (1) if you wish, but I recommend the higher variation.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div align=\"center\" class=\"image\" style=\"width: 206px;\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"/beginning-the-west-ridge-of-robinson/640850\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Beginning the West Ridge of Robinson\" height=\"150\" width=\"200\" src=\"/images/small/640850.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=\"caption\"&gt;Beginning the West Ridge of Robinson&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;1. When the ridge crest becomes blade-like and the ramps seem to end, climb up to a notch in the ridge and down a class 3 slab before continuing on a new ramp system on the right (south) side of the ridge.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;2. Ascend to a notch in the rib extending off of the main ridge. Climb beneath the chockstone and down a chute to continue traversing (cl. 3)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;3. Eventually an exposed hand traverse is reached. Footholds disappear as the ledge constricts. Downclimb below this section, traverse, then climb back up to the main ledge system.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;noformat&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;table&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;div align=\"center\" class=\"image\" style=\"width: 206px;\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"/entrance-to-the-first-catwalk/640851\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Entrance to the first catwalk\" height=\"150\" width=\"200\" src=\"/images/small/640851.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=\"caption\"&gt;Entrance to the first catwalk&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;div align=\"center\" class=\"image\" style=\"width: 156px;\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"/crossing-over/640852\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Crossing over\" height=\"200\" width=\"150\" src=\"/images/small/640852.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=\"caption\"&gt;Crossing over (1)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;div align=\"center\" class=\"image\" style=\"width: 156px;\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"/threading-the-chockstone/640853\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Threading the Chockstone\" height=\"200\" width=\"150\" src=\"/images/small/640853.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=\"caption\"&gt;Threading the Chockstone (2)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;div align=\"center\" class=\"image\" style=\"width: 156px;\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"/one-of-many-catwalk-entrances/640855\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"One of Many Catwalk Entrances\" height=\"200\" width=\"150\" src=\"/images/small/640855.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=\"caption\"&gt;One of Many Catwalk Entrances&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/noformat&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;4-5. The route cliffs out, but chutes above offer passage to another hidden ledge system. Climb 2 steep chutes. The first is class 3 (4), and the second is longer, steeper class 3 to easy class 4 (5). The rock in this chute is slightly loose but those rocks are easy to avoid. You can tell which chutes to take as they lead up to the ridge at a point between two spiky gendarmes. The one on the left is especially pointy.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;noformat&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;table&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;div align=\"center\" class=\"image\" style=\"width: 143px;\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"/crux-section-of-robinson-s-west-ridge/640836\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Crux section of Robinson s West Ridge\" height=\"200\" width=\"137\" src=\"/images/small/640836.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=\"caption\"&gt;Crux section of Robinson\'s West Ridge&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;div align=\"center\" class=\"image\" style=\"width: 206px;\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"/last-half-of-crux-section-on-robinson-s-w-ridge/640837\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Last Half of Crux Section on Robinson s W Ridge\" height=\"195\" width=\"200\" src=\"/images/small/640837.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=\"caption\"&gt;Last Half of Crux Section on Robinson\'s W Ridge&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt; &lt;div align=\"center\" class=\"image-left\" style=\"width: 206px;\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"/climbing-the-lower-chimney/640856\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Climbing the lower chimney\" height=\"150\" width=\"200\" src=\"/images/small/640856.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=\"caption\"&gt;Climbing the lower chimney (4)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt; &lt;div align=\"center\" class=\"image-left\" style=\"width: 156px;\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"/downclimbing-the-crux-chimney/640858\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Downclimbing the crux chimney\" height=\"200\" width=\"150\" src=\"/images/small/640858.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=\"caption\"&gt;Downclimbing the crux chimney (5)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/noformat&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;6. Once you are near the ridge, do not continue to the crest. Instead, climb right through one notch, down a short exposed slab to another more hidden notch. This accesses a new hidden catwalk system. In general, from here on out, follow weaknesses along a horizontal dike. Eventually you will scramble up near some diagonal dikes on a distant gendarme.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;noformat&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;table&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;div align=\"center\" class=\"image\" style=\"width: 206px;\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"/passing-through-another-notch/640861\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Passing through another notch\" height=\"148\" width=\"200\" src=\"/images/small/640861.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=\"caption\"&gt;Passing through another notch (6)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;div align=\"center\" class=\"image\" style=\"width: 156px;\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"/i-really-hope-this-goes-somewhere/640862\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"I really hope this goes somewhere!\" height=\"200\" width=\"150\" src=\"/images/small/640862.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=\"caption\"&gt;I really hope this goes somewhere!

Still following the dike, scramble up to and through an exposed hand traverse (cl. 3).

Turn left and scramble up a series of class 3 chutes to reach a notch in the main ridge. This is done just short of the gendarme with diagonal dikes. Once on the ridge crest, scramble up broken blocks on the crest, veering slightly right as you near the summit.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;10. Just short of the summit a headwall with steep dihedrals blocks progress. Turn right and scramble through another notch. This leads to class 2 ledges that wrap around to the East side of the summits, threads between the Middle and East Summit, and onto the North side of the ridge as you wrap around to the Middle and West summits.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;noformat&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;table&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;div align=\"center\" class=\"image\" style=\"width: 156px;\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"/looking-down-the-west-ridge-of-robinson/640873\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Looking down the West Ridge of Robinson\" height=\"200\" width=\"150\" src=\"/images/small/640873.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=\"caption\"&gt;Looking down the West Ridge of Robinson (9)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;div align=\"center\" class=\"image\" style=\"width: 206px;\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"/the-final-headwall-and-catwalk/640874\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"The Final Headwall and Catwalk\" height=\"150\" width=\"200\" src=\"/images/small/640874.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=\"caption\"&gt;The Final Headwall and Catwalk (10)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;div align=\"center\" class=\"image\" style=\"width: 206px;\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"/final-catwalk-entrance/640875\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Final Catwalk Entrance\" height=\"150\" width=\"200\" src=\"/images/small/640875.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=\"caption\"&gt;Final Catwalk Entrance (10)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/noformat&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Take care to look behind you as you scramble up this route, as it looks different in reverse and is just as difficult to return on.&lt;a name=\"chapter_4\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Descent&lt;/h2&gt;Retrace your route on the West Ridge. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If you are doing this scramble as an outing via Sam Mack Meadows, it would probably be faster and easier to descend the class 3 NE Face of Mt. Robinson and drop directly into Sam Mack Meadows or link up with the trail lower down. I haven\'t done this route, but my best guess is the line descends NE from the summit and enters a broad chute where the topographic maps indicate a permanent snowfield. This line looks to have easier scrambling than the West Ridge as well.&lt;a name=\"chapter_5\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Essential Gear&lt;/h2&gt;Some may desire a rope for the crux sections, and there are protection possibilities.

The turnoff is where the road is about at its lowest point before it starts going uphill again.  Refer to the map for which dir roads to take to get to the trailhead.  The trailhead is marked by a log cabin in the north side of the road.  I drove this road in a Subaru Impreza, which had low clearance, but also 4-wheel drive.  The road should be passable in a regular city car.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://www.summitpost.org/mountains/user_link.pl?user_id=26484\"&gt;&lt;b&gt;breezejr&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt; adds:&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;After the cabin, there is a small road that branches south.

The trail soon fades after the canyon forks.  Either fork will get you to the top (I took the south one).  Follow the bottom of the wash until you near the end of the tributary  (you\'ll need to refer to the topo map to tell where you are. It\'s hard to see out of the narrow winding canyon). From here the vegetation should be light enough for you to start scrambling straight up the mountain towards the dropoff. Once you reach the cliff, it should be obvious where Notch Peak is, and you can just walk along the ridgeline to the summit.  Descent options include going back down the south fork, or going down the north fork.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://www.summitpost.org/mountains/user_link.pl?user_id=26484\"&gt;&lt;b&gt;breezejr&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a&gt; adds: &lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt; Don\'t take the north route. It\'s much harder all around, and the wash includes a 100-foot drop. If you do go without a rope, you can downclimb a steep, knife-edge ridge that is just northeast of the sheer drop.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;noformat&gt;&lt;table&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;div align=\"center\" class=\"image\" style=\"width: 106px;\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"/these-are-some-cliffs-on-the/19443\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"These are some cliffs on the...\" height=\"66\" width=\"100\" src=\"/images/thumb/19443.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=\"caption\"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;div align=\"center\" class=\"image\" style=\"width: 106px;\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"/here-s-a-picture-of-my-dad/19444\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Here s a picture of my dad...\" height=\"68\" width=\"100\" src=\"/images/thumb/19444.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=\"caption\"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;div align=\"center\" class=\"image\" style=\"width: 106px;\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"/the-south-face-of-notch-peak/19448\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"The south face of Notch Peak\" height=\"70\" width=\"100\" src=\"/images/thumb/19448.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=\"caption\"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;div align=\"center\" class=\"image\" style=\"width: 106px;\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"/looking-down-at-the-base-of/19450\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Looking down at the base of...\" height=\"66\" width=\"100\" src=\"/images/thumb/19450.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=\"caption\"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/noformat&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_3\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Essential Gear&lt;/h2&gt;Make sure to bring all of the water you\'re going to need with you. There are no water sources along this trail.  A decent pair of hiking boots and a daypack are all one needs to hike the trail.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;An important thing to bring, though, is a spare tire or two.  The first time I visited Notch Peak I picked up some stranded motorists along the dirt roads leading to the canyon because they had gotten a flat and didn\'t have a spare.  My second time visiting the range, I got a flat and had to drive the spare all the way back to Salt Lake City.  The roads are very isolated out there, and if you have car troubles, it will proabably be a good while before you run into someone else.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;noformat&gt;&lt;table&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;div align=\"center\" class=\"image\" style=\"width: 71px;\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"/looking-down-the-north-face/19446\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Looking down the north face...\" height=\"100\" width=\"65\" src=\"/images/thumb/19446.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=\"caption\"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;div align=\"center\" class=\"image\" style=\"width: 106px;\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"/here-s-a-view-from-on-top-of/19445\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Here s a view from on top of...\" height=\"68\" width=\"100\" src=\"/images/thumb/19445.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=\"caption\"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;div align=\"center\" class=\"image\" style=\"width: 75px;\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"/the-south-face-of-notch-peak/19447\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"The south face of Notch Peak....\" height=\"100\" width=\"69\" src=\"/images/thumb/19447.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=\"caption\"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/noformat&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_4\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Miscellaneous Info&lt;/h2&gt;If you have information about this route that doesn\'t pertain to any of the other sections, please add it here.&lt;br&gt;&lt;div align=\"center\"&gt;&lt;a name=\"messages\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_5\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Additions and Corrections&lt;/h2&gt;[ &lt;a href=\"/object_discussion.php?type=vote_comments&amp;amp;object_id=157946&amp;amp;is_addition=1#vote_form\"&gt;Post an Addition or Correction&lt;/a&gt; ]&lt;table cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" style=\"width: 775px;\"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;table cellpadding=\"2\" cellspacing=\"2\" width=\"100%\"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;&lt;span class=\"pagertext\"&gt;Viewing: &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;-&lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt; of &lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td align=\"center\"&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td align=\"right\"&gt;    &lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;table border=\"0\" width=\"775\" class=\"messages\"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td width=\"110\" align=\"left\" valign=\"top\" style=\"padding-top: 6px;\"&gt;&lt;a name=\"82840\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a class=\"dis_user_lnk\" href=\"/users/breezejr/25351\"&gt;breezejr&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td valign=\"top\" style=\"padding-top: 6px;\"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Route Comment&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td align=\"right\" valign=\"top\" nowrap style=\"font-size: 10px;\"&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td valign=\"top\" rowspan=\"2\" align=\"left\" style=\"padding-top: 6px;\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=\"font-size: 9px; color: #888;\"&gt;Hasn\'t voted&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td colspan=\"2\" style=\"padding-top: 6px;\"&gt;1-After the cabin, there is a small road that branches south.

This road intersects the main highway just after Skull Rock pass. It should be the first dirt road on the right that you come to.  Follow this dirt road north, keeping an eye out for another, more rugged dirt road leading off to the right (east) of the road, towards Notch Peak.  It\'s hard to see, so keep a close look out for it. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;NOTE:  This road is labeled as a jeep road on topo maps.  I managed to get my Subaru Impreza to the end, but only after a lot of difficulty (and filling in some of the really big holes in the road with rocks).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This road eventually turns right just as it nears the mouth of a two canyons, then it starts going up the left fork for another 100 yards.

From there just walk up the rocky wash towards the base of the north face.  Eventually the tributary narrows and twists and turns, but one\'s view is not much restricted. Keep following the wash as far as desired.  I didn\'t make it to the end because altough I was hiking it in the fall, there was still snow in the bottom of the wash!  I kept post-holing and eventually turned back because it was getting dark.  The snow didn\'t begin until I got under the shadow of the face, though.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;noformat&gt;&lt;table&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;div align=\"center\" class=\"image\" style=\"width: 106px;\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"/here-s-the-north-side-of-the/19441\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Here s the north side of the...\" height=\"50\" width=\"100\" src=\"/images/thumb/19441.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=\"caption\"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;div align=\"center\" class=\"image\" style=\"width: 75px;\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"/looking-into-the/19442\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Looking into the...\" height=\"100\" width=\"69\" src=\"/images/thumb/19442.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=\"caption\"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/noformat&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_3\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Essential Gear&lt;/h2&gt;Same as for the Sawtooth trail, although in this case, a spare tire/s are even more important.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;noformat&gt;&lt;table&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;div align=\"center\" class=\"image\" style=\"width: 106px;\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"/the-cliff-bands-that-compose/19440\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"The cliff bands that compose...\" height=\"66\" width=\"100\" src=\"/images/thumb/19440.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=\"caption\"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;div align=\"center\" class=\"image\" style=\"width: 106px;\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"/looking-north-from-the-top-of/19449\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Looking north from the top of...\" height=\"67\" width=\"100\" src=\"/images/thumb/19449.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=\"caption\"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;div align=\"center\" class=\"image\" style=\"width: 106px;\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"/looking-down-off-the-north/19451\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Looking down off the north...\" height=\"69\" width=\"100\" src=\"/images/thumb/19451.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=\"caption\"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/noformat&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_4\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Miscellaneous Info&lt;/h2&gt;If you have information about this route that doesn\'t pertain to any of the other sections, please add it here.&lt;br&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_5\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Images&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div align=\"center\"&gt;&lt;table id=\"my_images\"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/the-cliff-bands-that-compose/19440/c-157948\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"The cliff bands that compose...\" src=\"/images/square/19440.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/looking-into-the/19442/c-157948\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Looking into the...\" src=\"/images/square/19442.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/i-really-thought-this-pillar/19430/c-157948\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"I really thought this pillar...\" src=\"/images/square/19430.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/here-s-the-north-side-of-the/19441/c-157948\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Here\\\'s the north side of the...\" src=\"/images/square/19441.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/looking-down-off-the-north/19451/c-157948\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Looking down off the north...\" src=\"/images/square/19451.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/looking-north-from-the-top-of/19449/c-157948\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Looking north from the top of...\" src=\"/images/square/19449.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/a-more-detailed-topo-showing/30643/c-157948\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"A more detailed topo showing...\" src=\"/images/square/30643.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/the-north-face-as-viewed-from/19431/c-157948\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"The north face as viewed from...\" src=\"/images/square/19431.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/article&gt;date:'),(240,157950,'/painter-spring/157950','/notch-peak/151567','Painter Spring','','','Cl. 1-3','','',4801,39.143,-113.409,'Utah, United States, North America','','',151567,'Notch Peak','','0.8','Hiking','','Most of a day','Route','content: &lt;article&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_1\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2 id=\"first_h2\"&gt;Approach&lt;/h2&gt;From the main dirt road used to get to the \'Ampitheater\' (see \'Ampitheater\' route), continue driving north. There should actually be a sign for Painter Spring a few more miles north of the turnoff to the \'Ampitheater\', with a well-maintained dirt road leading east towards the northern end of Sawtooth Mountain.  Painter Spring is marked by the mouths three canyons, lined with huge rock cliffs.  The road forks near two of the mouths, so it is up to you as to which one to take.  Since I was doing an exploratory loop, I just parked at the fork in the road and walke to the mouth of the more northern canyon.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;noformat&gt;&lt;table&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;div align=\"center\" class=\"image\" style=\"width: 106px;\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"/the-rock-formations-above-my/19439\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"The rock formations above my...\" height=\"66\" width=\"100\" src=\"/images/thumb/19439.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=\"caption\"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;div align=\"center\" class=\"image\" style=\"width: 106px;\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"/a-close-up-topo-map-of-the/30644\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"A close up topo map of the...\" height=\"80\" width=\"100\" src=\"/images/thumb/30644.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=\"caption\"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;div align=\"center\" class=\"image\" style=\"width: 106px;\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"/the-route-down-painter-spring/131865\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"The route down Painter Spring...\" height=\"75\" width=\"100\" src=\"/images/thumb/131865.JPG\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=\"caption\"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/noformat&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_2\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Route Description&lt;/h2&gt;In either main canyon, there is a moderately travelled trail that wanders along the wash bottoms going up the canyons. Follow the trail until it disappears. From there it is up to you where to go.  The canyons are great for exploring.  You can trace my route just by looking at the topo map. There are some springs in both canyons, so you can refill on water when hiking in this area.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A couple of things to consider: The rock is EXTREMELY sharp (so much so that it is hard to press you hand on it even for balance). This makes scrambling on it tricky, and it is proabably best to be avoided. The rock is also very loose.  The steepness of the terrain and the difficulty of the rock makes for very rugged exploration.  The short loop I have marked took me about 4-5 hours to do, and it was very wearing.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;noformat&gt;&lt;table&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;div align=\"center\" class=\"image\" style=\"width: 106px;\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"/this-is-in-one-of-the-canyons/19433\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"This is in one of the canyons...\" height=\"72\" width=\"100\" src=\"/images/thumb/19433.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=\"caption\"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;div align=\"center\" class=\"image\" style=\"width: 106px;\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"/the-sawtooth-range-north-of/19437\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"The Sawtooth Range north of...\" height=\"65\" width=\"100\" src=\"/images/thumb/19437.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=\"caption\"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;div align=\"center\" class=\"image\" style=\"width: 106px;\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"/this-is-the-large-rock/19435\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"This is the large rock...\" height=\"39\" width=\"100\" src=\"/images/thumb/19435.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=\"caption\"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/noformat&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_3\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Essential Gear&lt;/h2&gt;Map, food, water, long pants, gloves.

From here you can continue scrambling up either branch to reach the summit of the Twin Peaks.  I took the south branch up and used the north branch for descent.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The south branch is littered with burnt trees and ash covered ground left over from a fire that broke out here in the summer of 2002.  Although it was difficult at te time to keep the kicked up ash out of my mouth, it should be pretty well packed down by now. A plus is that the burned forest makes for much easier bushwacking.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Eventually you\'ll come across a large talus slope.  Looking at the north side of the branch, you can see a narrow  talus slope that cuts through the cliff bands above.  At the top of the cliff bands is a large boulder-strewn bowl with a cluster of pine trees in the middle.  From here it gets more difficult to tell where to go.  I scrambled up the middle of the east wall of the bowl to a narrow part in the cliff bands. Here is is a bit of a scramble for about 20 feet.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Since I didn\'t initially come up at the summit, I don\'t know exactly where to go from there, but what did work for me was to start hiking towards what appeared to be the highest part of the peak.   If you miss the summit, you might have to drop a little ways back down the slope to circumvent some larger blocks that surround it.  Searching below these blocks, a faint route can be seen. It is a modest scramble up the rock to the top.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;At the top you can see the slightly higher summit to the east. It is about a 20 minute scramble along the connecting ridgeline to gain the main summit.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I descended via the north branch, which starts at the saddle between the two summits.  A problem with going down this way is that there are about 5-4 rock bands you have to navigate from above, which makes them very hard to see. If you initially stay to the right side of the branch you can often find some chutes that cut through the cliff bands.  You must srcamble straight down the last cliff band, though. The best place to do this is in the middle of the band, where it happens to be narrower.  It is about a class 4 downclimb from here and then you\'re home free. Just descend the talus slope via a route of least resistance, making sure to stay close to the stream that forms, and you can soon regain the main trail.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;noformat&gt;&lt;table&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;div align=\"center\" class=\"image\" style=\"width: 72px;\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"/looking-at-the-ridge-that/19669\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Looking at the ridge that...\" height=\"100\" width=\"66\" src=\"/images/thumb/19669.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=\"caption\"&gt;

I went for the highest part of the peak, as stated, but at some point ended up going more to the right, which took me to a saddle between the west Twin and a smaller summit to its south.  It was pretty, but I had to back down a ways and then aim more for the left.  Except for the bushwhacking lower down the canyon, I highly recommend this route.

Drive up the La Sal Loop road for 12 miles, then take a dirt road on the right going to Geyser Pass. Drive on this for 5.55 miles and take a right onto a smaller dirt road. Follow this another 1.65 miles to the end. A trail heads off from the road here.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div align=\"center\" class=\"image\" style=\"width: 506px;\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"/mt-mellenthin-right-as-seen/30870\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Mt Mellenthin (right) as seen...\" height=\"335\" width=\"500\" src=\"/images/medium/30870.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=\"caption\"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_2\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Route Description&lt;/h2&gt;Distance: Approximately 7.89 miles&lt;br&gt;Total Elevation Gained:  5,030 feet&lt;br&gt;Time: It took me about 10 hours&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This route includes the Razor Fang traverse listed on the Mt Peale page. Photos of this route are found on pages corresponding to the peaks shown in them.&lt;br&gt;There are two variations to begin the route which meet up on top of peak 12048. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Variation 1: Begin hiking on the small trail that spurs off from the end of the dirt road. Follow the trail downhill, but as it turns to the left, continue walking downhill in the clearing to the stream. Ford the stream and  walk up the clearing heading southeast towards peak 12048. From here, continue scrambling up the talus field and scramble up a steep slope of loose talus and scree to gain the ridgeline.  There is usually some thin patches of snow that run up most of the slope well into summer, and these make the route much easier.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Variation 2: Stay on the trail that starts at the road, and follow it as it turns east and ascends into Gold Basin. As the trail begins to enter some clearings and the surrounding peaks are visible, you\'ll be able to see a prominent gouge in the hillside below peak 12048 that goes all the way down to the boulderfield.  Scramble up this gouge to gain the steep meadow slopes above, and keep hiking slightly to the right until the ridgeline is gained. This route is nicer than the first variation when snow isn\'t present since the ground is much more stable. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;From the ridgeline, scramble up to the summit of peak 12048 (Little Tuk) and continue on the ridgeline to the top of Mt Tukhunikivatz. Follow the ridgeline over to Mt Peale. There is a short section called the Razor Fang that must be negotiated. If one climbs to the right, staying low, the loose scree below can be avoided while the scrambling never gets above low class 3 (assuming one doesn\'t wander too far to the dropoff in the north side).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As the junction of Mt Tukhunikivatz, Mt Peale, and Mt Mellenthin is gained, a slight trail will be visible leading towards Peale. From here Peale can easily be hiked.  Make sure to return to the junction, and follow the northward spur towards Mount Mellenthin. Hike over the two peaks on this ridge (one is pk 12271, the other has no label) and scramble up the prominent south ridge of Mt Mellenthin. If one stays near the cliff on the ridge, the rock stays more solid. There are some faint trails that switchback up this scree slope, and the summit is easily gained.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Head back down the ridge towards peak 12271. From the saddel between 12271 and Mellenthin, a faint trail can be seen traversing a little below the summit of peak 12271. Follow this trail as it goes right and travels down a west-facing ridgeline. From here, it is easy cross country hiking to treeline, making sure to stay on the top of the ridge. At the last mound on the ridge, make sure to take the branch heading right and go down the shallow gully that forms on this part of the ridge. The hiking below treeline is easy, with little or no bushwacking. Eventually, if one stays close to the bottom of the gulley, a stream is reached, and then a clearing with a faint 4X4 road. Follow this road a few hundred yards to where it joins a larger dirt road (you drove in on this one). Turn left and follow the dirt road another 100 yards or so back to the trailhead.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div align=\"center\" class=\"image\" style=\"width: 490px;\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"/a-topographic-map-with-the/30869\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"A topographic map with the...\" height=\"500\" width=\"484\" src=\"/images/medium/30869.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=\"caption\"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_3\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Essential Gear&lt;/h2&gt;Good hiking boots, camera, food, plenty of water (no places to refill on the route!).

As the trail begins to enter some clearings and the surrounding peaks are visible, you\'ll be able to see a prominent gouge in the hillside below peak 12048 (Little Tuk) that goes all the way down to the boulderfield. Scramble up this gouge to gain the steep meadow slopes above, and keep hiking slightly to the right until the ridgeline is gained. This route is nicer than the first variation when snow isn\'t present since the ground is much more stable due to the soil that is present between the smaller rocks.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div align=\"center\" class=\"image\" style=\"width: 419px;\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"/a-topo-map-showing-both/30887\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"A topo map showing both...\" height=\"650\" width=\"413\" src=\"/images/original/30887.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=\"caption\"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;noformat&gt;&lt;table&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;div align=\"center\" class=\"image\" style=\"width: 106px;\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"/looking-down-the-alternative/30874\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Looking down the alternative...\" height=\"66\" width=\"100\" src=\"/images/thumb/30874.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=\"caption\"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;div align=\"center\" class=\"image\" style=\"width: 71px;\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"/the-alternative-route-up-pk/30878\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"The  Alternative Route  up pk...\" height=\"100\" width=\"65\" src=\"/images/thumb/30878.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=\"caption\"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;div align=\"center\" class=\"image\" style=\"width: 106px;\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"/the-alternative-route-up/30873\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"The alternative route up...\" height=\"85\" width=\"100\" src=\"/images/thumb/30873.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=\"caption\"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;div align=\"center\" class=\"image\" style=\"width: 77px;\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"/looking-down-the-alternative/30875\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Looking down the alternative...\" height=\"100\" width=\"71\" src=\"/images/thumb/30875.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=\"caption\"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;div align=\"center\" class=\"image\" style=\"width: 106px;\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"/the-summit-of-little-tuk-seen/30876\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"The summit of Little Tuk seen...\" height=\"73\" width=\"100\" src=\"/images/thumb/30876.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=\"caption\"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/noformat&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_3\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Essential Gear&lt;/h2&gt;Good hiking boots, camera, food, plenty of water (no places to refill on the route!).

Scramble up and over this block to gain the ridge, and continue the class 3 scramble to the summit. Don\'t give into the temptation of following the ledges to the left away from the ridgeline - the rockfall is bad and getting committed to climbing up the couloir on the south side is not ideak. Stick to the ridgeline until the summit is gained. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Descent: Usually people descend the class 2 slopes (a vary long boulder-hopping route) down to White Pine Lake, and hike out on the main trial.  The best way to gain this route is follow the ridgeline until the red quartzite gives way to the white colored granite. This is a good point to begin descending.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;noformat&gt;&lt;table&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;div align=\"center\" class=\"image\" style=\"width: 106px;\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"/the-east-ridge-route-seen/31046\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"The East Ridge Route, seen...\" height=\"67\" width=\"100\" src=\"/images/thumb/31046.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=\"caption\"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;div align=\"center\" class=\"image\" style=\"width: 68px;\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"/the-east-ridge-route-of-red/31048\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"The East Ridge route of Red...\" height=\"100\" width=\"62\" src=\"/images/thumb/31048.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=\"caption\"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;div align=\"center\" class=\"image\" style=\"width: 106px;\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"/the-summit-as-viewed-during/54872\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"The summit as viewed during...\" height=\"75\" width=\"100\" src=\"/images/thumb/54872.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=\"caption\"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;div align=\"center\" class=\"image\" style=\"width: 106px;\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view-from-the-summit-of-red/82565\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"View from the summit of Red...\" height=\"75\" width=\"100\" src=\"/images/thumb/82565.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=\"caption\"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/noformat&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_3\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Essential Gear&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;u&gt;Summer:&lt;/u&gt;&lt;br&gt;10 Essentials and good hiking boots.

In the early spring one can hike straight up the snow slopes to the top of teh peak once the left fork of Elbow Fork is gained. This slope makes for a nice glissade upon descent as well.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Thayne Canyon: Start at the trailhead just around the corner from the Church Fork Picnic Grounds.  Take either the high or low trail and head up Thayne canyon towards Thayne Peak (which is an easy peak to  bag along the way).

In the summer it is probably better to stick to the west ridgeline. When it is snow covered but late enough in the season that the avalanche danger is nonexistent, one can just head straight up!&lt;br&gt;If electing to ascend the west slopes during the winter, caution should be taken. These slopes are greater than 30 degrees and have seen some slides occur in the winter and early spring. Ascending the west slopes proper may put you on the ridge to the south, southwest of Raymond\'s true summit. Caution should be taken to stay on the west side of the ridge and off the ridge proper in winter.

Drive across the bridge (losed in the winter), take the right branch at the top of the hill, and park near the end of the road. Take off hiking along the Bowman Fork stream. Eventually the trail climbs out of the canyon and traverses over to Porter Fork, ending in a traverse across open slopes near the saddle. This is a great spot for skiing and a a prime location for avalanches. In the winter a trail compacted through the snow leads most of the way up.

The route starts at the waterfall and from there it gains 3,800 feet in 1.23 miles with an average gain of 3,085 ft/mile or 35.8 degrees.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Scramble up the steep eroded trail on the left side of the granite slabs and waterfall. Continue scrambling up the narrow canyon.  The canyon has vertical or overhanging granite walls and is very narrow, but there is easy routefinding that avoids water and bushwacking.  The terrain is stepped, with flat portions broken up by occasional waterfalls. You can climb around these, and the scrambling never exceeds class 3.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Eventually an impassable waterfall will be reached an it will be necessary to scramble higher up on the canyon walls on the left side of the stream.  After passing the waterfall, one can see the canyon widen up.  Drop down to the stream again, and take the second tributary canyon on the left ca. 7800ft.  From here the granite boulders and stream disappear and a series of long, angled granite slabs are reached.  Scramble up these, taking care to stay to the left on any fork in the chute.  At one point there is a difficult scrambling portion composed of a wide, deep chimney with overhanging rock and a chockstone.  This is the crux of the route and I\'d rate it 5.7 (if you can reach the VERY high foothold, that is).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Beyond the crux the scrambling continues on granite slabs, but this eventally turns to quartzite at ca. 9600 ft. I continued up what looked like a large crack/chute in the quartzite, intially keeping to the right, and then staying right on the ridgeline.  Eventually the ridgeline between Little Cottonwood Canyon and Deaf Smith Canyon is reach ca. 10,200 ft.  From here it is an easy class 2-3 scramble along the ridgeline to the west summit and then the east summit.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;From here one can then do the \'Triple Traverse\' (see the Dromedary Peak page) and descend Broads Fork Canyon or Tanners Gulch. Doing this route, the \'Triple Traverse\' and then descending Broads Fork took me about 8 hours.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;noformat&gt;&lt;table&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;div align=\"center\" class=\"image\" style=\"width: 81px;\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"/october-2003-nearing-the/41324\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"October 2003 - nearing the...\" height=\"100\" width=\"75\" src=\"/images/thumb/41324.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=\"caption\"&gt;

I will describe the route from the west summit of the Broads Fork Twin Peaks:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;From the west summit, scramble along the saddle ridgeline keeping to the north until nearing the east summit.  From the east summit, descend the rough trail to another saddle.  From there, leave the trail and continue along the ridgeline. Eventually some class 3 downclimbing is needed to drop off the southwest side of the ridge.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;From there, walk along the broad sloping ledge on the south side of Sunrise Peak.  Eventually a chute will be reached that looks good for scrambling.  This takes you to the top of a minor summit, with the actual summit of Sunrise Peak only a few dozen yards away.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;After summitting Sunrise Peak, descend the peak heading west, staying close to the ridgeline.  It gets exposed here with a knife edge dropoff to the north.  There is some loose rock to mind, but the scrambling is easy.  Stick to the ridgeline and avoid any temptation of dropping to the south - that will only bring about bushwacking.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Once the saddle between Sunrise Peak and Dromedary Peak is reached, there is a cliff barrier.  To get around this, drop off the ridge to the north, descending about 50-100 feet until a branching chute can be accessed. This chute bypasses the cliff and terminates on the Mt Dromedary ridgeline.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;From there is is an easy class 2 scramble to the final summit!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;noformat&gt;&lt;table&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;div align=\"center\" class=\"image\" style=\"width: 81px;\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"/october-2003-looking-3-000/41341\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"October 2003 - Looking 3,000...\" height=\"100\" width=\"75\" src=\"/images/thumb/41341.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=\"caption\"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;div align=\"center\" class=\"image\" style=\"width: 81px;\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"/october-2003-sunrise-peak/41340\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"October 2003 - Sunrise Peak...\" height=\"100\" width=\"75\" src=\"/images/thumb/41340.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=\"caption\"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;div align=\"center\" class=\"image\" style=\"width: 106px;\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"/triple-traverse-left/105026\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Triple Traverse (left:...\" height=\"60\" width=\"100\" src=\"/images/thumb/105026.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=\"caption\"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;div align=\"center\" class=\"image\" style=\"width: 106px;\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"/october-2003-sunrise-peak/41337\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"October 2003 - Sunrise Peak...\" height=\"75\" width=\"100\" src=\"/images/thumb/41337.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=\"caption\"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;div align=\"center\" class=\"image\" style=\"width: 106px;\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"/october-2003-sunrise-peak/41338\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"October 2003 - Sunrise Peak...\" height=\"75\" width=\"100\" src=\"/images/thumb/41338.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=\"caption\"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/noformat&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_4\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Essential Gear&lt;/h2&gt;Plenty of water, good hiking boots.

Shasta Wilderness; turn to your left and follow that road for 5.2 miles to another sign located on Forest Service road #41N15 at which time you will make another left. Follow that road for 4.9 miles to a 4-way dirt intersection at the #31 road, and then continue straight on road #41N61. Follow the Clear Creek Trailhead sign for 0.7 miles to road #41N25Y. Follow the signs again for 2.2 miles until you reach the trailhead. You can take a more scenic route by taking the Ski Park Highway north of Highway 89 until you run into the #31 road. The #31 road takes you around the east side of the Mountain, crossing Squaw and Mud creek, for 11.5 miles until you reach the intersection of #41N15 and #41N61. Once you&rsquo;re there just follow the Clear Creek Trailhead signs.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Its difficult finding this trailhead, and you can easily get lost and end up driving in circles. Take care to make the right turns!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;noformat&gt;&lt;table&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;div align=\"center\" class=\"image\" style=\"width: 106px;\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"/the-clear-creek-and-wintun/42682\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"The Clear Creek and Wintun...\" height=\"83\" width=\"100\" src=\"/images/thumb/42682.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=\"caption\"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;div align=\"center\" class=\"image\" style=\"width: 106px;\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"/july-2003-looking-down-the/42684\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"July 2003 - Looking down the...\" height=\"68\" width=\"100\" src=\"/images/thumb/42684.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=\"caption\"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;div align=\"center\" class=\"image\" style=\"width: 106px;\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"/july-2003-the-summit-of-mt/42693\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"July 2003 - The summit of Mt...\" height=\"62\" width=\"100\" src=\"/images/thumb/42693.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=\"caption\"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/noformat&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_2\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Route Description&lt;/h2&gt;The beginning of this route is the same as that for the Clear Creek route.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;From the trailhead, follow the series of abandoned roads through the trees. Eventually the dirt road/trail fades into a trail and follows a ridgeline that descends gradually to the northeast and drops off SHARPLY to the southwest.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Eventually you will reach a long, narrow clearing in the trees. Continue up this clearing, staying to the southwest (left) side of the clearing. The clearing suddenly widens, and as one begins to see the clearing end, a small strip of trees reappears close to the right.  This is near where the Clear Creek route diverges.  Follow these about halfway from where they first appear to the end of the clearing, and then cut through them to your right (you should see points where the strip of trees narrow again). If you stayed in the clearing and cut through the trees at the very end of it, you would be going on the Clear Creek route.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The ridgeline above has rocks protruding. To get around these to gain the ridgeline, ascend while traversing north for a few hundred yards. The terrain gets steep here.  Eventually the terrain gets steep enough that the easiest line of ascent is straight up the ridge. Take this ascent and you will top out on a broad, flat ridgeline.  From here you can already see the summit!  It looks close, but it is really much farther away than it appears. The ridge soon narrows, and takes the form of flat portions followed by steeply sloped or 2nd-3rd class scrambles portions.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As one gets higher, the route gets steeper.  Stay strictly to the ridgeline to keep on-route and to avoid the glaciers that the ridge runs between.  These glaciers can usually be spotted from a distance since the bergschrunds are prominent.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;At ca. 10,800 ft (just level with a flat portion farther to the south and the base of the Watkins Glacier), the ridge is somewhat absorbed into the mountain and steepens greatly into a short headwall.  Above this, travel up a broad shallow chute between two rock ridges. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Eventually a rocky headwall is reached (ca. 12,000 ft) and one is directed through an opening in the rock ridge to the right. Now you are on the edge of the Wintun Glacier.  Keep going up this new broad chute, keeping to the left to avoid getting too far out on the glaciar.  Eventually a more prominent ridgeline is gained if one strays to the left, and the ground flattens greatly, with the summit block only a few hundred yards away.  This is where the Clear Creek route rejoins the Wintun Ridge route.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Descent options include going back down the Wintun Ridge or the Clear Creek route.  I personally enjoyed descending the Clear Creek route since it had opportunities for VERY LONG glissades, but I definitely believe that the Wintun Ridge is a far more scenic ascent route.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;noformat&gt;&lt;table&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;div align=\"center\" class=\"image\" style=\"width: 106px;\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"/july-2003-roberto-climbs/42687\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"July 2003 - Roberto climbs...\" height=\"67\" width=\"100\" src=\"/images/thumb/42687.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=\"caption\"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;div align=\"center\" class=\"image\" style=\"width: 106px;\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"/july-2003-roberto-ascending/42694\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"July 2003 - Roberto ascending...\" height=\"68\" width=\"100\" src=\"/images/thumb/42694.JPG\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=\"caption\"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;div align=\"center\" class=\"image\" style=\"width: 72px;\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"/july-2003-these-strange/42690\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"July 2003 - These strange...\" height=\"100\" width=\"66\" src=\"/images/thumb/42690.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=\"caption\"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/noformat&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_3\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Essential Gear&lt;/h2&gt;Ice axe, lots of water, and a camera!

The slopes get steep enough that they might require a rope in the winter time, but I doubt it.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Take care to stay off of the glaciers that this route skirts!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;noformat&gt;&lt;table&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;div align=\"center\" class=\"image\" style=\"width: 72px;\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"/july-2003-glissading-down/42691\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"July 2003 - Glissading down...\" height=\"100\" width=\"66\" src=\"/images/thumb/42691.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=\"caption\"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;div align=\"center\" class=\"image\" style=\"width: 75px;\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"/july-2003-a-snack-break/42696\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"July 2003 - A snack break...\" height=\"100\" width=\"69\" src=\"/images/thumb/42696.JPG\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=\"caption\"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;[img:42696:aligncenter:thumb:]&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/noformat&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_4\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Miscellaneous Info&lt;/h2&gt;If you have information about this route that doesn\'t pertain to any of the other sections, please add it here.&lt;br&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_5\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Images&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div align=\"center\"&gt;&lt;table id=\"my_images\"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/july-2003-looking-down-the/42684/c-160128\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"July 2003 - Looking down the...\" src=\"/images/square/42684.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/clear-creek-bowl/333730/c-160128\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Clear Creek Bowl\" src=\"/images/square/333730.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/july-2003-glissading-down/42691/c-160128\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"July 2003 - Glissading down...\" src=\"/images/square/42691.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/july-2003-the-summit-of-mt/42693/c-160128\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"July 2003 - The summit of Mt...\" src=\"/images/square/42693.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/july-2003-these-strange/42690/c-160128\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"July 2003 - These strange...\" src=\"/images/square/42690.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/the-clear-creek-and-wintun/42682/c-160128\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"The Clear Creek and Wintun...\" src=\"/images/square/42682.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/july-2003-roberto-ascending/42694/c-160128\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"July 2003 - Roberto ascending...\" src=\"/images/square/42694.JPG\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/july-2003-roberto-climbs/42687/c-160128\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"July 2003 - Roberto climbs...\" src=\"/images/square/42687.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/july-2003-a-snack-break/42696/c-160128\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"July 2003 - A snack break...\" src=\"/images/square/42696.JPG\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/through-the-clouds/333731/c-160128\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Through the clouds\" src=\"/images/square/333731.JPG\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/wintun-ridge-via-clear-creek-trailhead/668941/c-160128\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Wintun Ridge via Clear Creek Trailhead\" src=\"/images/square/668941.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/up-wintun-ridge/333732/c-160128\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Up Wintun Ridge\" src=\"/images/square/333732.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/above-clear-creek-bowl/333728/c-160128\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Above Clear Creek Bowl\" src=\"/images/square/333728.JPG\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/wintun-ridge/333729/c-160128\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Wintun Ridge\" src=\"/images/square/333729.JPG\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/article&gt;date:'),(252,160560,'/west-ridge/160560','/white-mountain-peak/150221','West Ridge','','','LONG Walk Up, class 3 scrambling','','',13780,37.6344,-118.255,'California, United States, North America','','',150221,'White Mountain Peak','','0.8923076923076924','Scramble/hike','','One to two days','Route','content: &lt;article&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_1\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2 id=\"first_h2\"&gt;Approach&lt;/h2&gt;The route begins in Jeffery Mine Canyon.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;From Bishop take highway 6 north past Chalfant. After Chalfant, the road goes up a rise, and then descends. There is a small settlement called Hammil where the road begins to ascend again. Turn right on the first paved road at the settlement (19.03 miles from Bishop).  Follow this as it turns into a dirt road. Soon it splits - take the left fork (0.65 miles).    Drive on this dirt road as it parallels the back of some property, and take the second obvious dirt road on the right (0.3 miles).  Follow this dirt road as far as your vehicle can go! &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There is space for turning around before entering the canyon 1 mile up this final dirt road (5,000 ft)  and just past the mouth of the canyon at 2.3  miles (ca. 5700 ft).  The road is blocked to vehicular traffic at  2.8 miles (ca. 6100 ft), where there is a final turn around.&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;table class=\"inline_image_thumbs\"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=47335\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/47335.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=47336\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/47336.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=47349\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/47349.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=47337\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/47337.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=47338\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/47338.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_2\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Route Description&lt;/h2&gt;Note: All distances are relative to the lowest turnaround point on the dirt road unless stated otherwise)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;1-Way Distance: 7.69 miles&lt;br&gt;Elevation Gain: 9,600 ft&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;From wherever you parked, walk up the road.  Eventually it becomes impassable to vehicles and the the only recent use apparent is walking.  Eventually the road climbs out of the creek to the right and begins ascending more steeply.  Keep following the road and eventually all traces of it will disappear, but there is a well maintained hiking trail.  Follow this up Jeffery Mine Canyon to the Black Eagle Camp at Jeffery Mine at 7,550 ft (ca. 3 miles)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A note about Black Eagle Camp - these are some WONDERFUL free-to-use cabins built and maintained by volunteers working to restore Jeffery Mine.  Anyone can feel free to use these cabins, which have outhouses, electricity, beds (no sheets though), cooking supplies, books, and even Monopoly!  They also have running water and a shower during certain times of the year.  More information can be found at http://www.blackeaglecamp.org   &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There is one lone cabin encountered first, and then a whole complex about 100 yards farther down the trail.  From here the route becomes less certain for the south ridge.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;South Ridge Variation&lt;br&gt;(I only descended this route, and my way down wasn\'t the most pleasant, but I\'m not aware of any better way to gain the ridge, so here are the ways that I\'m aware of (feel free to tell me if you know a better way))&lt;br&gt;Continue following the trail as it passes by the cabins. Eventually the trail reaches a creek and ends abruptly on the south side at a small mineshaft.  From here, scramble up to the top of the ridgeline anyway that seems to work.  One way is to follow the stream uphill for about   0.14 miles (or ca. 300 vertical feet) beyond the mine shaft, where some chutes enter the river.  Follow these dirt-filled chutes up to the flat clearing on the South Ridge just below the large vegetated talus slope at 9,000 ft. From here, just keep following the ridgeline all the way to the top! &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There are some flat spaces for camping at the base of this slope at 9,00 feet, or at the top at 10,400 ft. Beyon this point the elevation gain is gradual until 11,400 ft.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;At 11,400 ft the South Ridge merges with the North Ridge, and a steep talus and scree slope follows. After half a dozen false summits, the unnamed 13,200 ft peak on the ridgeline is gained.  Beyond the highest summit is a slightly rugged class 3 ridgeline. This ridgeline is overcome by scrambling on either side and on top along various points along it.  To avoid the ridgeline all together, you may have to traverse the steep slopes as far as 1,000 ft below the unnamed peak. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Eventually a saddle is gained (ca. 13,000ft) and there is an uninterrupted talus and scree slope leading to White Mountain\'s lower west summit (ca. 13,900ft). For the remainder of the route, the talus and scree is very loose and its stability is hard to predict - I\'d reccomend doing the route when this part has 100% snow cover, if possible.  DO NOT go all the way to the summit unless you want to climb it - it is impassable on the other side. Instead, traverse around the slopes to the north of the summit about 100 ft below it to gaint the saddle between the east and west summits.  From here it is just a short scramble to the main summit!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;North Ridge Variation&lt;br&gt;DO NOT DO THIS ROUTE UNLESS YOU LIKE BUSHWACKING!  Just beyond the long west-facing cabin (which as of this writing is unfinished), there is a smaller trail that branches off to the left.  Follow this up a creek, and then out of the creek, switchbacking up a small ridge. Eventually a flat area is reached and the trail becomes harder to follow as it seems to have been swept away by a landslide on the southern flanks of this ridge. Continue scrambling up this ridge until the main North Ridge is gained. From here, just scramble/bushwack around the gendarmes on the ridgeline until the route meets the nicer South Ridge at 11,400 ft.  The remainder of the route is the same as that for the South Ridge.&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;table class=\"inline_image_thumbs\"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=47223\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/47223.JPG\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=47341\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/47341.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=47343\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/47343.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=47222\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/47222.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=47224\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/47224.JPG\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_3\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Alternative Approach and Route Description&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;i&gt;Dirk &lt;a href=\"http://www.summitpost.org/user_page.php?user_id=453\"&gt;&lt;b&gt;\"Diggler\"&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Summers recently completed the route by taking a different approach and was able to stay on the south spur of the West Ridge the entire way. His route might be preferable to mine, so I\'m listing it here in its entirety as a recommended alternative:&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;Note: following abbreviations are used throughout this &lsquo;comment:&rsquo; S = south; N = north; W = west; E = east; R = right; L = left; WMP = White Mountain Peak; mi = mile(s).&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;The approach:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If approaching the W ridge of WMP from the N (i.e. Bay Area, Lee Vining, Reno), I would say that it is more expedient to drive the following way (which is more direct), route instead of going S to Bishop then basically turning around &amp;amp; going back N (as described in the current section- essentially backtracking) until reaching the turnoff on Highway 6 for WMP. I&rsquo;d say it is approximately 60 vs. 84 miles.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;From the 120-395 junction (just S of Lee Vining), go S for approximately 5 miles to where the 120 splits from the 395S to go E. Take the 120E for about 45 miles to Benton (look out for deer at night!). Where the road dead-ends at a T-intersection (@ Benton), hang a R &amp;amp; head S on the 6 for approximately 15 mi. Directly at/past the green marker for Post Mile (PM) 19, hang a L (W) onto White Mtn. Ranch Rd (directly across the 6 it continues as Chidago Cyn Rd going Wward).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;(start the trip-meter here, i.e. 0.0) Follow White Mtn Ranch Rd E towards WMP. After approximately .5 mi (there is some type of building on ones L) the road turns to dirt. Continue down this road. At 2.5 miles a spur branches off &amp;amp; goes up the mountain- this is the beginning of the S spur of the W ridge. I think that this should be passable by a standard car (however, I did this in my 4X4 Tacoma, so don&rsquo;t know for sure). Directly after this split (~100&rsquo; beyond) is a place to park (between the road one has been following &amp;amp; one that parallels it to the L, i.e. on the &lsquo;mountain&rsquo; side). There is room here for 1, &amp;amp; definitely not more than 2 or 3, cars. This is also a good place to bivy- it allows one to acclimate to some degree before setting off (hopefully early!) the next morning.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;The route:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The start is approximately 5,500&rsquo; elevation. Follow the spur road upwards. After passing a shack &amp;amp; dilapidated radar dish (~6,500&rsquo;?), at a certain point the road peters out &amp;amp; disappears. Go over a bulge. From here one can discern a trail. Follow this as far as possible until you lose it. Go through the forest (for reference, the slope through this section steepens toward the canon to the N, &amp;amp; mellows out to the S) until a steep, ugly, scree-covered headwall is encountered (~9,000&rsquo;)-. Slog up this until it is surmounted (~10,000&rsquo;). At this point the ridge is well defined. Follow it to the summit, traversing up &amp;amp; down over several humps en route (some class 3). The psychological crux starts at a notch in the ridgeline at approximately 11,200&rsquo;. One drops a disheartening 150&rsquo; or so to get here. The N spur of the W ridge joins with the S one above this notch. Above this low-point looms an ugly, 1000&rsquo; tall scree slope that must be surmounted. It is as bad as it looks, &amp;amp; quite possibly worse on the descent (much ankle-twisting potential). When this is surmounted, the ridge solidifies somewhat, &amp;amp; there is actually some pleasant 3rd class on the way to the summit.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Notes/suggestions:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&bull; Bring LOTS o&rsquo; water! 5 quarts/litres per individual should suffice for all but the hottest days of summer (unless there is snow, there will be virtually no water on the route either).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&bull; Being acclimated prior to starting is a huge benefit on this route!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&bull; Bring hiking poles (at least once snow-free; otherwise an ice axe probably a good idea)- any potential injury to a delicate ego from using them is insignificant compared with the benefit gained by lessening the damage to ones knees over the course of the ascent/descent, as well as the potential to save sprained ankles in the numerous horrible scree sections (esp. for those with weak ankles).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&bull; Bring a headlamp- this is a LONG route!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&bull; Look around (&amp;amp; behind- i.e. the way things will look during the descent) during the ascent! Much of this route is X-country, &amp;amp; knowing/remembering what to expect on the descent can save one a lot of time (esp. if it gets dark)! (this is a good procedure for any mountain, I&rsquo;ve learned)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&bull; Be prepared for both extremely hot &amp;amp; extremely cold temp&rsquo;s- I&rsquo;ve experienced both on this mountain!&lt;a name=\"chapter_4\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Essential Gear&lt;/h2&gt;Bring lots of water! There is a stream in the canyon where you can refill water, but it only goes so high and can dry up in the summer!&lt;br&gt;Good hiking boots, possibly a helmet for the upper parts of the route.&lt;br&gt;When snow is present, ice axe, crampons, and avalanche rescue gear.&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;table class=\"inline_image_thumbs\"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=47339\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/47339.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=47342\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/47342.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=47344\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/47344.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=47348\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/47348.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=47340\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/47340.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_5\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Miscellaneous Info&lt;/h2&gt;If you have information about this route that doesn\'t pertain to any of the other sections, please add it here.&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;table class=\"inline_image_thumbs\"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=47346\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/47346.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=47345\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/47345.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=47347\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/47347.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

color: #888;\"&gt;Hasn\'t voted&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td colspan=\"2\" style=\"padding-top: 6px;\"&gt;Hey Mark, here are some notes/observations from when I did the S spur:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Note: following abbreviations are used throughout this &lsquo;comment:&rsquo; S = south; N = north; W = west; E = east; R = right; L = left; WMP = White Mountain Peak; mi = mile(s). &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;The approach:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If approaching the W ridge of WMP from the N (i.e. Bay Area, Lee Vining, Reno), I would say that it is more expedient to drive the following way (which is more direct), route instead of going S to Bishop then basically turning around &amp;amp; going back N (as described in the current section- essentially backtracking) until reaching the turnoff on Highway 6 for WMP. I&rsquo;d say it is approximately 60 vs. 84 miles.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;From the 120-395 junction (just S of Lee Vining), go S for approximately 5 miles fto where the 120 splits from the 395S to go E. Take the 120E for about 45 miles to Benton (look out for deer at night!). Where the road dead-ends at a T-intersection (@ Benton), hang a R &amp;amp; head S on the 6 for approximately 15 mi. Directly at/past the green marker for Post Mile (PM) 19, hang a L (W) onto White Mtn. Ranch Rd (directly across the 6 it continues as Chidago Cyn Rd going Wward).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;(start the tripmeter here, i.e. 0.0) Follow White Mtn Ranch Rd E towards WMP. After approximately .5 mi (there is some type of building on ones L) the road turns to dirt. Continue down this road. At 2.5 miles a spur branches off &amp;amp; goes up the mountain- this is the beginning of the S spur of the W ridge. I think that this should be passable by a standard car (however, I did this in my 4X4 Tacoma, so don&rsquo;t know for sure). Directly after this split (~100&rsquo; beyond) is a place to park (between the road one has been following &amp;amp; one that parallels it to the L, i.e. on the &lsquo;mountain&rsquo; side). There is room here for 1, &amp;amp; definitely not more than 2 or 3, cars. This is also a good place to bivy- it allows one to acclimate to some degree before setting off (hopefully early!) the next morning.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;The route:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The start is approximately 5,500&rsquo; elevation. Follow the spur road upwards. After passing a shack &amp;amp; dilapidated radar dish (~6,500&rsquo;?), at a certain point the road peters out &amp;amp; disappears. Go over a bulge. From here one can discern a trail. Follow this as far as possible until you lose it. Go through the forest (for reference, the slope through this section steepens toward the canon to the N, &amp;amp; mellows out to the S) until a steep, ugly, scree-covered headwall is encountered (~9,000&rsquo;)-. Slog up this until it is surmounted (~10,000&rsquo;). At this point the ridge is well defined. Follow it to the summit, traversing up &amp;amp; down over several humps en route (some class 3). The psychological crux starts at a notch in the ridgeline at approximately 11,200&rsquo;. One drops a disheartening 150&rsquo; or so to get here. The N spur of the W ridge joins with the S one above this notch. Above this low-point looms an ugly, 1000&rsquo; tall scree slope that must be surmounted. It is as bad as it looks, &amp;amp; quite possibly worse on the descent (much ankle-twisting potential). When this is surmounted, the ridge solidifies somewhat, &amp;amp; there is actually some pleasant 3rd class on the way to the summit. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Notes/suggestions:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&bull;	Bring LOTS o&rsquo; water! 5 quarts/litres per individual should suffice for all but the hottest days of summer (unless there is snow, there will be virtually no water on the route either).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&bull;	Being acclimated prior to starting is a huge benefit on this route!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&bull;	Bring hiking poles (at least once snow-free; otherwise an ice axe probably a good idea)- any potential injury to a delicate ego from using them is insignificant compared with the benefit gained by lessening the damage to ones knees over the course of the ascent/descent, as well as the potential to save sprained ankles in the numerous horrible scree sections (esp. for those with weak ankles).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&bull;	Bring a headlamp- this is a LONG route!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&bull;	Look around (&amp;amp; behind- i.e. the way things will look during the descent) during the ascent! Much of this route is X-country, &amp;amp; knowing/remembering what to expect on the descent can save one a lot of time (esp. if it gets dark)! (this is a good procedure for any mountain, I&rsquo;ve learned)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&bull;	Be prepared for both extremely hot &amp;amp; extremely cold temp&rsquo;s- I&rsquo;ve experienced both on this mountain!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td valign=\"bottom\" style=\"padding-top: 6px;\" colspan=\"2\"&gt;&lt;span style=\"font-size: 9px; color: #888;\"&gt;Posted Sep 20, 2007 5:55 pm&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;table border=\"0\" width=\"775\" class=\"messages\"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td width=\"110\" align=\"left\" valign=\"top\" style=\"padding-top: 6px;\"&gt;&lt;a name=\"491179\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a class=\"dis_user_lnk\" href=\"/users/jbondca77/127651\"&gt;jbondca77&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td valign=\"top\" style=\"padding-top: 6px;\"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Awesome camp&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td align=\"right\" valign=\"top\" nowrap style=\"font-size: 10px;\"&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td valign=\"top\" rowspan=\"2\" align=\"left\" style=\"padding-top: 6px;\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=\"font-size: 9px; color: #888;\"&gt;Hasn\'t voted&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td colspan=\"2\" style=\"padding-top: 6px;\"&gt;In the seventies went up this with some friends.

There were small level spots at the base of the small trees-  just enough space for a sleeping bag.

Turn left onto Rainbow Oaks Circle, which ends between an LDS Church to the north and Hidden Valley Park to the south. Park here and begin hiking down the dirt road.&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;table class=\"inline_image_thumbs\"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=58073\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/58073.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_2\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Route Description&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;br&gt;From the church parking lot, walk up a dirt road as it switchbacks toward tha mouth of Big Willow Canyon. Right as you enter the canyon there will be a small but well defined trail that branches off the road to the right. Follow this steep trail as it cuts south through scrub oak across the western slopes of the Lone Peak Massif. Eventually the trail turns up Littlle Willow Canyon. Make sure to take the switchback at the \'avalanche danger\' sign farther up the canyon.&lt;br&gt;The trail climbs over a ridge and drops into Big Willow, traversing along the heavily forested south side of the canyon until the trail reaches the canyon bottom. From here, the trail winds its way through pine forests and meadows as the base of huge granite cliffs to the north.  Eventualy a headwall is reached, which can be bypassed by scrambling up the slopes to the north. From here, continue hiking along the canyon bottom until the cirque is reached near treeline.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Cut south across the open cirque and continue up the steep headwall. Follow just to the right of a prominent arete that cuts 1/3 of the way down the slope. There is some airy class 3 scrambling on large solid blocks for the last hundred feet. There are some losse boulders sitting around, so use caution. Once the top of the cirque is reached, just walk across the plateau to the highpoint to the southeast - this is where the knife-edge ridgeline to the summit begins.

Turn left on 3775 E (first left on the road), and then turn right on Timberline Circle. The trailhead begins at a dirt road. There are some signs for the trailhead that are easy to see. Park anywhere along the residential streets. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_2\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Route Description&lt;/h2&gt;Elevation Gain: 4,324 ft&lt;br&gt;Distance: 3.5 miles&lt;br&gt;Difficulty: Moderately Strenuous - Class2-3&lt;br&gt;Follow the dirt road as it enters the canyon. There are lots of popular climbing walls at the mouth of the canyon, and use-trails abound, so take care to stay on the MAIN trail that cuts through these areas. The trail is seldom used, so it is thickly covered in vegetation and at certain times of the year part of the river overflows into the trail.&lt;br&gt;As you pass flat ground in the climbing areas, there will be a quartzite wall that blocks progress up the canyon, dropping directly into the river. Cross the river to the north side here and continue up a STEEP hill. About 100 yards up the stream, just past this cliff, cross the stream back to the south side. The trail continues steeply up the canyon, crossing again to the north shortly before a few flat switchbacks begin.  Continue straight at the final switchback to reach a viewpoint, or double back to your right to continue up the canyon.&lt;br&gt;The trail becomes much more rough and overgrown from this point. Eventually the trail crosses the stream once more, and follows along the northern edge of a steep meadow below some cliffs on the south side of the canyon. At the far side of the meadow (ca 7,800 ft) the trail drops into a dry stream bead, meandering in and slightly out of if as you pass cliffs on the southern side of the canyon. After a long, steep straightaway, the upper meadow is reached and the trail flattens again. From here the trail becomes practically nonexistant. Cut through the connected series of meadows on the north side of the canyon until you reach the start of either route variation:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;West Ridge: Class 3&lt;br&gt;This route has minimal vegetation and some nice class 3 walls that interrupt a class 2 ridge as one climbs the final few hundred feet to the summit. To access this route,  aim toward the lower left side of the summit that looms above as you travel through the meadow. Eventually a large chute can be seen cutting through the cliffs - it has a pine tree growing in it. Climb up this chute and midway up follow a prominent ledge system that cuts back to the west.  These ledges drop you off on the ridge. From here, just scramble to the summit.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;East Ridge: Class 2-3&lt;br&gt;Although this route is the standard way to access the summit, it sucks. It requires more crosscountry travel across the upper meadow before scrambling begins, and there is much brush to navigate while scrambling. To take this route, continue up the north side of the upper meadow until a low point beyond the Storm Mountain summit is reached in the headwall. Scramble up to this, and then follow the ridge to the left until the summit is gained.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;table class=\"inline_image_thumbs\"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=58082\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/58082.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=58083\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/58083.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=58087\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/58087.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_3\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Essential Gear&lt;/h2&gt;10 Essentials&lt;br&gt;Helmet if traveling in a group&lt;br&gt;Ice axe, crampons, snow shoes might be useful between November and June&lt;br&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_4\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Miscellaneous Info&lt;/h2&gt;If you have information about this route that doesn\'t pertain to any of the other sections, please add it here.&lt;br&gt;&lt;div align=\"center\"&gt;&lt;a name=\"messages\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_5\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Additions and Corrections&lt;/h2&gt;[ &lt;a href=\"/object_discussion.php?type=vote_comments&amp;amp;object_id=161320&amp;amp;is_addition=1#vote_form\"&gt;Post an Addition or Correction&lt;/a&gt; ]&lt;table cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" style=\"width: 775px;\"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;table cellpadding=\"2\" cellspacing=\"2\" width=\"100%\"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;&lt;span class=\"pagertext\"&gt;Viewing: &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;-&lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt; of &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td align=\"center\"&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td align=\"right\"&gt;    &lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;table border=\"0\" width=\"775\" class=\"messages\"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td width=\"110\" align=\"left\" valign=\"top\" style=\"padding-top: 6px;\"&gt;&lt;a name=\"336763\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a class=\"dis_user_lnk\" href=\"/users/moogie737/22269\"&gt;Moogie737&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td valign=\"top\" style=\"padding-top: 6px;\"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Trailhead improvements&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td align=\"right\" valign=\"top\" nowrap style=\"font-size: 10px;\"&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td valign=\"top\" rowspan=\"2\" align=\"left\" style=\"padding-top: 6px;\"&gt;&lt;p class=\"disc_avatar\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"/users/moogie737/22269\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Moogie737\" width=\"50\" height=\"50\" border=\"0\" src=\"/images/avatars/188943.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=\"font-size: 9px; color: #888;\"&gt;Voted 10/10&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td colspan=\"2\" style=\"padding-top: 6px;\"&gt;As of August 2009 one can find paved parking spaces, a drinking fountain (two spigots for people, one for dogs!) and a small improved trail leading up through a mini-amphitheater.

The ridge between Pioneer Peak and Sunset Peak is discussed on the Sunset Peak page. To gain the ridgeline, you can follow the Brighton Ridge Run route and cut off early on many of the cat track trails to go directly to the Crest Express Lift. For a better workout, take the Brighton Ridge Run.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Brighton Ridge Run (To Pioneer Peak):&lt;br&gt;Distance: TBA&lt;br&gt;Elevation Gain: 1,650\'&lt;br&gt;Follow the Lake Mary Trail 0.73 miles to the turnoff to Dog Lake. Take the turnoff. As you near Dog Lake, the trail will split - take the left fork. The trail will gradually ascend as it traverses across the Brighton Ski Resort. Slightly farther than 1.21 miles from Dog Lake the trail reaches the ridgeline at a cat-track linking the Snake Creek lift to the Great Western lift. This point is known as Snake Creek  Pass. Walk towards the Snake Creek lift and travel cross-country over peak 10315. The terrain is fairly open, and occasionally a use-trail is visible. Eventually the Crest Express lift is reached. Continue along the ridgeline over peak 10321. As you go over the far side of the peak, a much better defined use trail can be seen below to the left. Follow this trail to the saddle below Pioneer Peak and all the way to the summit. &lt;br&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_3\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Essential Gear&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;br&gt;10 Essentials.

Slightly farther than 1.21 miles from Dog Lake the trail reaches the ridgeline at a cat-track linking the Snake Creek lift to the Great Western lift. This point is known as Snake Creek  Pass.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There are two use trails leading to the summit from Snake Creek Pass.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For the longer route, follow the cat-track from Snake Creek Pass to the Great Western Lift. Where the track ends a use trail continues heading north. This trail winds up to the ridge, just north of the summit, and then follows the ridge-line to the summit. The final few hundred feet requires some easy boulder hopping. This route in total took me about an hour from the parking lot.&lt;br&gt;For the shorter route, follow the cat-track from Snake Creek Pass towards the Great Western Lift.

Take the turnoff. As you near Dog Lake, the trail will split - take the left fork. The trail will gradually ascend as it traverses across the Brighton Ski Resort. Slightly farther than 1.21 miles from Dog Lake the trail reaches the ridgeline at a cat-track linking the Snake Creek lift to the Great Western lift. This point is known as Snake Creek Pass. &lt;br&gt;Walk towards the Snake Creek lift and travel cross-country over peak 10315. The terrain is fairly open, and occasionally a use-trail is visible. Eventually the Crest Express lift is reached. Continue along the ridgeline over peak 10321. As you go over the far side of the peak, a much better defined use trail can be seen below to the left. Follow this trail to the saddle below Pioneer Peak and all the way to the summit. &lt;br&gt;From the Pioneer Peak summit, the use-trail continues down the west side of the mountain to a saddle before ascending the ridgeline to Sunset Peak. Multiple trails have formed from lack of maintanence, so take care to stay on what seems to be the track that is more likely to be a main trail. The trail becomes sandy, but soon the ground turns back to rock as the trail crosses the ridge to the east, making narrow switchbacks until the summit of Sunset Peak is gained. From here, one can make an easy descent via a maintained trail to Catherine Pass to descend to Brighton or Alta.&lt;br&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_3\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Essential Gear&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;br&gt;10 Essentials.

Use the Twin LakesTrailhead, which begins as a dirt road at the Mt Millicent ski lifts, which are at the near end of the skier parking lot. An alternative is to begin at the Brighton/Solitude Nordic Center that is just before the skier parking lot. From here one circumvents Silver Lake before ascending to Twin Lakes Reservoir.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;From Alta, the route is initially on a road, which begins at the Forest Service garage, a low, stonefaced building across the highway from the Alta Lodge, 8.3 miles up Little Cottonwood Canyon. There is ample parking along the road in Alta.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_2\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Route Description&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;br&gt;Elevation Gain (Alta): 2,079\'&lt;br&gt;Distance (Alta): 3 miles&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Elevation Gain (Twin Lakes TH): 1,949\'&lt;br&gt;Distance (Twin Lakes TH): 3 miles&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;From Alta to Twin Lakes Pass: From the Forest Service garage, take the right fork in the road. This switchbacks to the left, and then the right again as it winds its way between office facilities and cabins. After the second switchback the road makes a long ascending traverse into Grizzly Gulch before reaching Twin Lakes Pass, 2.08 miles (ca. 1,400ft) later.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;From Brighton to Twin Lakes Pass: From the ski lift, follow the dirt road as it winds its way up the hillside, making many switchbacks. Eventually the Twin Lakes Reservoir is reached. Head to the right of the dam, where a well-defined trail continues up the slope. This trail crosses a saddle behind Mt Evergreen and merges with a dirt road in the Solitude Ski Resort. The trail cuts a switchback in the road, before re-emerging briefly with it just below some wooden structures. The road turns right, but the trail stays left and passes back over the ridgeline, making a gradually ascending traverse above the Twin Lakes Reservoir until the Twin Lakes Pass is reached. This trail provides great views of the Mt Wolverine Cirque.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;From Twin Lakes Pass: From the pass, head straight up the ridge to the right, underneath the powerline poles. A use-trail should be apparent arount the foundations for the towers. This use-trail is faint, but constant, as it switchbacks steeply through open slopes and brush to the higher (?) eastern summit. From here you can use a combination of feint trails and common sense route-finding to travel just to the left of the ridgeline to reach the west summit. From the western summit, you can easily find a clear route heading straight down the slope, towards a visibly maintained trail below. About halfway down to it, a feint trail will be encountered. If you traverse along this feint trail rather than continuing to the maintained one, some elevation loss will be avoided. The feint trail is easy to follow in most places, although occasionally some care is needed when it fades, in order to find where it resumes. The trail eventually terminates just below the second electrical transmission tower on the Twin Lakes Pass. From here, descend either approach trail. *Note* - the final leg of this loop would be very difficult to follow in reverse if you wish to make use of the vague trails. It is best to do the loop in the direction described.&lt;br&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_3\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Essential Gear&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;br&gt;Bring the 10 Essentials.

When looking at Wolfs Head from Jackass Pass or from The Cirque, East Ridge route follows the crest of Wolfs Head\'s ridge from right to left (from east near Pingora, westward).  The actual summit is not visible from most \"low\" vantage points within the Cirque (though clearly visible from some of the higher peaks in the Cirque incl. &lt;a href=\"http://www.summitpost.org/mountains/mountain_link.pl?mountain_id=3463\"&gt;Warbonnet&lt;/a&gt;) - the apparent high points are merely the gendarmes (which the route \"snakes\" around).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Typically, the East Ridge route is assumed to begin at the low point between Tiger Tower and Wolfs Head.  Everything prior to this point should therefore fall under \"Approach\".  Two variations exist for reaching this starting point:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;(1)&lt;/b&gt; (firsthand experience)  Scramble to the base of south face of Wolfs Head almost directly below the above-mentioned low point (just west of the southern base of Tiger Tower).  You\'re looking for a prominent (dirty and wet!) chimney which starts at ground level.  Scramble up the intermittent and grassy ledge system starting immediately left (west) of this chimney (don\'t climb the chimney!).  Many apparently call these ledges class 4.  We thought they were harder - though there is much class 4 terrain, we encountered moves up to about 5.4 on wet, slick, and dripping rock.   Many variations up the ledge system probably exist - some might be easier than others.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;(2)&lt;/b&gt; (have not done) Apparently, an alternative to above approach involves going up a class 3 gully between Tiger Tower and Pingora (gully immediately west of Tiger summit and again on the south side of the formation).  Low to mid fifth class climbing is required to top out on Tiger followed by a rappel into the Tiger-Wolfs Head notch and the start of East Ridge route proper.&lt;a name=\"chapter_2\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Route Description&lt;/h2&gt;This is one of (two in the Cirque) the classic climbs listed by Roper and Steck.  Deservedly so in my opinion!!  The climb is fairly long (~10 pitches or so), offers a variety of challenges in terms of technical rock climbing, traverses beautifully clean and solid rock throughout its length, and offers an unforgettable position.   The route ratings for East Ridge in published literature range from a grade II, 5.5 (Roper and Steck) to a grade III, 5.6 (Kelsey) - with the latter probably being more reasonable and in-line with what  an \"average\" weekend warrior expects.  However, don\'t take these too lightly as the route is very committing and when combined with the lightning-storm prone weather of the Winds dangerous epics are never too far off.  If caught in a storm once atop the ridge, escape would not be trivial - best bet MIGHT be to either quickly double back or quickly push forward.  Dropping down directly via either south or north faces is probably not recommended (though a 5.10 chimney on the south side of the formation is mentioned as being an [bad = implied in Kelsey\'s book] option for rapping off) - you\'d be in unknown territory and having to leave gear behind would most likely be the least of your worries.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Most parties doing the route do at least some simul-climbing esp. during the initial easy few pitches required to reach the top of the ridge.  I will describe the route as we did it and provide some additional comments.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Pitches 1 - 3:&lt;/b&gt;  Climbing is probably in the 4th to low 5th class here and the goal is to reach the point on the ridge where the grade essentially flattens out.  Start up the initial (and overhyped IMHO) \"2 foot wide 5.6 friction slab with no pro\".......it really is not that bad.  The \"slab\" is very low angle, probably more like 5 feet wide, and offers comfortable amount of gear (and more realistically it\'s much easier than 5.6!).  There are several comfortable belay \"ledges\" along the ridge, with the first being less than a 50m rope length above the start of the route.  Above this first \"ledge\" terrain steepens for next 2 or so pitches but handholds and cracks abound.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Pitch 4:&lt;/b&gt;  This is mostly a class 4 scramble (with low 5th moves) along the portion of the ridge where it flattens out after the initial climb out of the Wolfs Head-Tiger col.  The goal of this (very roughly) pitch is to reach the east side of the First Tower (one of many gendarmes of the ridge).  You\'ll know which one is the first tower (forget the little spires you\'ll pass off to your sides - they\'re not it) as it looks like it blocks further progress.  Right before the tower, you\'ll downclimb south (left).  Belay somewhere before this tower or rope drag will eat you up.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Pitch 5:&lt;/b&gt;  5.6.  This is the first true 5.6 pitch - even that, we\'re only talking about one move.  This is also (more or less) where we switched from simul-climbing and into belaying individual pitches.  Downclimb (I\'ve read somewhere on the web that some rap this section??) about 20 feet of class 3-4 terrain on the south (left) side of the ridge.  You\'re now at the east edge of First Tower on its south side.  Step across (awkward but short and well-protected) hugging a boulder.  Traverse along south side of tower and enter a narrow (and I mean very narrow!!) slot that separates First and Second Towers.  Move via slot to north side.  My fat behind refused to fit through until I removed a camelbak from my back.  It\'s slightly wider higher up but kind of spooky.  Exist onto ledge on north side and belay (rope drag might be bad at this point).  This is a wide ledge at the north base of Second Tower (can see two good pitons further on the ledge).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Pitch 6:&lt;/b&gt;  The \"piton pitch\"!  This is the second honest 5.6 pitch of the route.  Continue traversing westward along the northern base of Second Tower.  The ledge becomes progressively narrower and eventually ends.  Keep on traversing moving onto a face (friction and some features) beyond ledge.  Clip 3 or 4 good-looking pitons along this traverse.  Beyond the pitons, move up and regain ridge crest via a 5.6 lieback up a crack.  Belay on ridge crest.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Pitch 7:&lt;/b&gt;  This pitch presents the third true 5.6 section of the route.  The last pitch should have deposited you at the eastern base of the Third Tower.  This one is characterized by two parallel horizontal cracks on its north (right) side.  Move up to gain the lower of the two cracks - use it for feet or hands whatever your perversion but do protect it sufficiently depending on your second\'s confidence level.  Traverse the cracks westward with the crux being the exit move at the end.  Beyond move over easy terrain (first on north or right side) and regain the ridge crest.   Your goal here is to reach the eastern base of the Fourth Tower.  Specifically, you\'ll downclimb into a cave-like hole (on south or left side of ridge crest) formed by the tower and a flake/boulder on its SE side).  Belay here.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Pitch 8:&lt;/b&gt;  The fourth 5.6 crux of the route.  From \"cave\", exit south (left) and begin a 20 foot traverse on south side of Fourth Tower.  Looks harder than it is once you get on it.  Protect it well for your second.  You can tie off a large horn at the end of the traverse for your follower\'s benefit.  Here you have some options for remainder of the pitch.  The goal is a nice ledge formed by a huge chockstone about 20 feet ahead and 20 feet above you.  You can either face traverse straight toward the corner/chimney (looks like no pro) then climb the chimney up to finish the pitch....OR....Climb down about 20 feet (low 5th class) to reach a ledge, then traverse over the to start of the chimney and climb it from the bottom.  If you choose to downclimb, protect it well for the second as they will be doing it w/o the toprope.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Pitches 9 - 10:&lt;/b&gt;  4th to low 5th class climbing.  Start by traversing over easy terrain on north side (right) of ridge crest.  Gain ridge crest where convenient.  End last pitch on summit block.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Descent:&lt;/b&gt;  This can sound a bit confusing when reading Kelsey\'s description......what \"west face\"?  From your vantage point in the Cirque, you\'d think that there should be no west FACE but only a west RIDGE.  Actually that\'s not true and becomes apparent only once you\'re there.  Strategy is to drop west then drop some more south, then do a long traverse south to reach Wolfs Head-Overhaning Tower Col.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Details go something like this:&lt;br&gt;Find rap slings 5 feet below and on right side of summit.  Single rope rap (50 is fine too I think) brings you to a talus-filled ledge.  This is R1 on topo.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Look on right side of ledge for another set of slings.  Do another single rope rap to a larger ledge - R2 on topo.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Walk the \"trail\" left (that\'s RAPELLER\'s left) or south around a wall, then descend about 50 feet down a gully (which is facing south).  Class 2-3 with only the final section of the \"walk\" being exposed (hip belay??).  Find rap slings.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Do another rappel (southward - looking in direction of Overhanging Tower).  We did single 60 m rope and could not reach next rap station - had to scramble easy terrain (class 3) to get to it.  This is R3.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Two more raps.  Again we did single 60m raps and were short every time requiring an easy downclimb/walk.  These are R4 and R5 on topo.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;After the last rap (I\'m ALMOST certain I have the count right!!), look for a \"trail\" heading left on narrow ledges around a corner.  If you look down the rap line, you should see just a void!!  The walking portion starts here.  Take the \"trail\" which crosses weaknesses in slabs (quite exposed at times) on the west side below the crest of the ridge between Wolfs Head and Overhaning Tower.  Walk for several hundred yards.  You should start seeing some cairns and exposure becomes lesser as you near the Col (Wolfs Head-Overhanging Tower Col).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The \"trail\" ends at a horn with slings just above the Col.  Rap into Col - we used double 60\'s, single would PROBABLY suffice here as well.  This is R6 on topo.  Walk 30 feet to top of Col and hike down the east side.  Scramble down talus fields (snow in early season) towards Cirque Lake.&lt;a name=\"chapter_3\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Essential Gear&lt;/h2&gt;Standard rack with cams to about 3\" size.  Helmets.&lt;br&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_4\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Topo&lt;/h2&gt;This is not a topo in the true sense of the word.

Your info was very helpful on our climb.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;On P8 I took the downclimb option as it looked like the thin crack petered out to face climbing. However, as I climbed up the chimney and looked back, I saw a nice flake that created a nice hand-fist crack that was invisible from the approaching side. Looked like a fun and protectable hand traverse. So perhaps you can adjust the description of this pitch? Knowing about this ahead of time would make for a more elegant and fun line!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Also, one bit of confusion on the descent info was the chute you descend for R3. You say it faces south. The chute faces west while the climber is facing south as one climbs into it. Also, knowing that it is a very short walk from the R2 before the downclimb would be helpful. We overshot the gully and had to come back!&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td valign=\"bottom\" style=\"padding-top: 6px;\" colspan=\"2\"&gt;&lt;span style=\"font-size: 9px; color: #888;\"&gt;Posted Aug 26, 2012 7:50 pm&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;table border=\"0\" width=\"775\"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;table cellpadding=\"2\" cellspacing=\"2\" width=\"100%\"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;&lt;span class=\"pagertext\"&gt;Viewing: &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;-&lt;b&gt;8&lt;/b&gt; of &lt;b&gt;8&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td align=\"center\"&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td align=\"right\"&gt;    &lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_6\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Images&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div align=\"center\"&gt;&lt;table id=\"my_images\"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/starting-up-the-exposed-east/20202/c-161870\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"starting up the exposed east...\" src=\"/images/square/20202.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/east-ridge/64062/c-161870\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"East Ridge\" src=\"/images/square/64062.JPG\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/airy-traverse/87061/c-161870\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Airy traverse\" src=\"/images/square/87061.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/east-ridge/64194/c-161870\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"East Ridge\" src=\"/images/square/64194.JPG\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/east-ridge/63915/c-161870\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"East Ridge\" src=\"/images/square/63915.JPG\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/looking-east-down-the-ridge/20208/c-161870\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"looking east down the ridge...\" src=\"/images/square/20208.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/east-ridge/64229/c-161870\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"East Ridge\" src=\"/images/square/64229.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/exposed-easy-5-6-cracks/20203/c-161870\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"exposed easy (5.6) cracks...\" src=\"/images/square/20203.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/south-face-of-wolfs-head/64647/c-161870\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"South Face Of Wolfs Head\" src=\"/images/square/64647.JPG\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/east-ridge/64061/c-161870\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"East Ridge\" src=\"/images/square/64061.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/alasdair-on-the-thin-part-of/7414/c-161870\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Alasdair on the thin part of...\" src=\"/images/square/7414.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/east-ridge/63926/c-161870\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"East Ridge\" src=\"/images/square/63926.JPG\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/east-ridge/64059/c-161870\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"East Ridge\" src=\"/images/square/64059.JPG\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/east-ridge/64078/c-161870\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"East Ridge\" src=\"/images/square/64078.JPG\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td colspan=\"7\" align=\"center\"&gt;[ &lt;a href=\"/east-ridge/images/p-161870\"&gt;View Gallery - 13 More Images&lt;/a&gt; ]&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/article&gt;date:'),(264,163114,'/pharaohs-glen/163114','/grandeur-peak/151751','Pharaohs Glen','','','Class 2-','','',5337,40.707,-111.759,'Utah, United States, North America','','',151751,'Grandeur Peak','','0.6','Scramble, Hike','','Half a day','Route','content: &lt;article&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_1\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2 id=\"first_h2\"&gt;Approach&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;From SLC&lt;/b&gt;:  Drive eastbound on I-80 up Parleys Canyon. The trailhead is at the first bridge crossing over the freeway just east of the quarry on the N side of Parleys Canyon (about 2 miles from the mouth of the canyon). Coming from this direction you can\'t reach the trailhead, so you must turn around. To do so take the first offramp after this (a little more than a mile farther), cross the freeway, and get back on heading Westbound. &lt;br&gt;Heading WB on I-80, take the first offramp, turn left and cross over the freeway on a narrow bridge. Park on a turnoff on the far side of the bridge. The road enters private property beyond this point.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;See &lt;a href=\"http://www.summitpost.org/mountains/photo_link.pl/p/photo_id__167673__object_id__2099__type__mountain__mountain_id__2099__route_id____user_id____order_by____limit__\"&gt;Grandeur Pk Routes&lt;/a&gt; map for directions labels.&lt;br&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_2\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Route Description&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Distance:&lt;/b&gt; 1.93 miles (1-way)&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Total Elevation Gain:&lt;/b&gt; 3,210\' ft&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Trail Steepness:&lt;/b&gt; 1,600 ft/mile&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The West Slopes and Church Fork routes are probably more enjoyable ways to the summit of Grandeur Pk. This route is best done if you want to do a new route on Granduer and/or enjoy Pharoahs Glen, which is very scenic. Also, for those into suffering, it is steeper on average than the West Slopes trail.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;font color=\"red\"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Note:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt; The beginning of the trail crosses private property. According to the backcountry sking map I referenced, hikers are allowed to cross it, although according to Joe Bullough, climbing on the crags bordering the property is not allowed. If one really wants to, the private property can be skirted w/ some bushwacking.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;From the pullout, continue up the road to the right. Walk past the gate (if it is open) and around a switchback until you get to a road junction. Take a right and curve back around as you pass by a building. Pass the building on the south side heading east. You will see a dirt road climbing a hill in front of you. (If you don\'t want to pass near the building, you can reach the road by going left at the junction for a few hundred feet and scramble up the hillside).&lt;br&gt;The dirt road tops out on a flat area and from here a trail continues up Pharaohs Glen. The trail bypasses some cliffs to the left (class 2 scrambling) and winds its way up the canyon. At times it is hard to follow but there are red trail-markers at regular intervals.&lt;br&gt;Eventually you will cross the stream to the west side of the canyon, and then cross it again to the east (this second crossing is at a wierd cement platform. When I was there there was a pit with boulders in the middle of it, covered with a terra-cotta bowl).&lt;br&gt;After another few minutes, the terrain flattens and one has a clear view of a wide open run on the west side of the canyon, bordered by forest on the left and a rocky ridge on the right. From here on it is cross-country. Cross the stream and head up the clearing until the ridge is gained. This can be either a class 1 slog or a class 2 scramble. Follow the ridge until you meet up with the obvious West Slopes trail.&lt;br&gt;The final part of the route involves some moderate bushwacking, but there is a faint game trail a little right of the ridge that keeps it pretty light.&lt;br&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_3\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Essential Gear&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;br&gt;Sturdy boots, a pack, and tolerance for a little bushwacking. In winter the route is mostly windswept, so snowshoes probably aren\'t needed. The final 150 ft stretch before the West Slopes ascends a 32 degree slope w/ a NE aspect, so avalanching on this stretch could be possible. Use your judgement and bring a beacon, shovel, and probe if snow conditions are unstable.&lt;br&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_4\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Miscellaneous Info&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;br&gt;If you have information about this route that doesn\'t pertain to any of the other sections, please add it here.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/article&gt;date:'),(265,163332,'/forgotten-arete/163332','/mount-olympus/151263','Forgotten Arete','','','I 5.2','','',6291,40.657,-111.77,'Utah, United States, North America','','',151263,'Mount Olympus','','0.8923076923076924','Scramble','','Half a day','Route','content: &lt;article&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_1\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2 id=\"first_h2\"&gt;Approach&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;br&gt;Begin from the Mount Olympus Trail trailhead and head up the main trail. Pass Tolcat Canyon and Blister Hill. After the top of Blister Hill you begin to enter some groves of pine trees.   After passing through a couple of these, you will enter a brief clearing to your right as the trail switchbacks left. From here, head up the clearing - the arete should be easy to see from here (it is the near one). Just head to the base and pick a starting point!&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;table class=\"inline_image_thumbs\"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=82874\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/82874.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=82878\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/82878.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=82883\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/82883.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_2\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Route Description&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;br&gt;I discovered this route on one of my fores up Mt Olympus. Looking for something new, and to avoid the tedious final portion of the trail, I headed towards a rocky arete that led to the false summit just south of the trail.   &lt;br&gt;The route had sustained scrambling, solid rock, and excellent views - certainly one of the BEST class 3-4 routes in the Wasatch!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Tour de Olympus:  Ascend the Mt Olympus Trail, then take the Forgotten Arete, finish off at the main summit. Then do the Summit Traverse and descend the West Ridge. Highly recommended!&lt;br&gt;_________________________________________________&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The route is roughly 700-800 vertical feet of sustained class 3 with some class 4 and low 5th class segments. The route can easily be abandoned by dropping into a chute to the south.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;From the bottom there are many starting points, but your best bet is to aim a little south of the arete in the beginning. Scramble back and forth up a series of class 2-3 ledges. Eventually, by heading up these ledges (or taking a ramp on the N end of the arete midway up this first part), the arete is gained.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As you climb the arete, it is possible to stay on it religiously for almost the entire route. For the most part it is class 3-4 with two 5th class cruxes.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The first crux is about 1/3 of the way up and consists of either an awkward chute w/ loose rock, or a mantle and friction traverse to the West to regain the direct ridge. I\'d rate this 5.2 at the most.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The second crux is a 15-20ft slab that I would also consider upper 4th to low 5th class. This is just below the top of the minor summit.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Once you reach the minor summit, there is a short class 3 knife-edge ridge and some easy X-country for about 200 yards to reach the main trail at the saddle. &lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;table class=\"inline_image_thumbs\"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=82876\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/82876.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=82877\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/82877.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=82875\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/82875.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_3\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Essential Gear&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;br&gt;Good sturdy shoes and the 10 Essentials. There is very little loose rock on the route, and there are few places where you could knock a rock on someone unless they were right behind you, so a helmet probably isn\'t needed. &lt;br&gt;Also, the crux sections are short and there is a lot of potential for rope drag, so the route is best if free-soloed.&lt;br&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_4\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Miscellaneous Info&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;br&gt;If you have information about this route that doesn\'t pertain to any of the other sections, please add it here.&lt;br&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_5\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Images&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div align=\"center\"&gt;&lt;table id=\"my_images\"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/december-19th-2004-the/82883/c-163332\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"December 19th, 2004 - The...\" src=\"/images/square/82883.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/december-19th-2004-looking/82878/c-163332\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"December 19th, 2004 - Looking...\" src=\"/images/square/82878.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/december-19th-2004/82874/c-163332\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"December 19th, 2004 -...\" src=\"/images/square/82874.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/feb-26-2006/176744/c-163332\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"feb 26 2006\" src=\"/images/square/176744.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/december-19th-2004/82876/c-163332\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"December 19th, 2004 -...\" src=\"/images/square/82876.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/december-19th-2004-looking/82875/c-163332\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"December 19th, 2004 - Looking...\" src=\"/images/square/82875.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/feb26-2006/176742/c-163332\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"feb26 2006\" src=\"/images/square/176742.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/december-19th-2004-looking/82877/c-163332\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"December 19th, 2004 - Looking...\" src=\"/images/square/82877.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/forgotten-arete/176740/c-163332\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Forgotten Arete\" src=\"/images/square/176740.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/topping-out-arete/176745/c-163332\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"topping out arete\" src=\"/images/square/176745.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/article&gt;date:'),(266,163334,'/north-summits-traverse-bypass/163334','/mount-olympus/151263','North Summits Traverse (bypass)','','','Class 3-4','','',4000,40.657,-111.77,'Utah, United States, North America','','',151263,'Mount Olympus','','1.0','Scramble, Basic Snow Climb','','Most of a day','Route','content: &lt;article&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_1\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2 id=\"first_h2\"&gt;Approach&lt;/h2&gt;The route described begins at the higher south summit of Mt Olympus and ends at the top of the West Ridge.

After about 50-100 ft you should be able to downclimb to the north a little and then traverse back to the east. At the end of this short descending traverse, you will enter a wide chute that drops straight down to the saddle below. &lt;br&gt;From the saddle, travel north until the cliffs are reached. Descend to the west while staying along the base of the cliffs. After about 300 ft there will be a break in the cliffs. It is not possible to descend to the next chute from this break. Instead, drop down another 50 ft to a large platform with a huge boulder resting on it.  The downclimb is class 3 if chosen carefully. I ended up taking a way that was class 4.&lt;br&gt;From this platform, head north. While slightly ascending, once can easily find a series of ledges and chimneys that cut through the many ribs of the northern summits.&lt;br&gt;Continue traversing until a large chute is reached. The cliffs on the far side are very pronounced and the chute is mostly clear of vegetation and irregular rocks. Head up this class 2 chute to gain the northern-most summit (class 2) and the highest north summit (class 4, via a steep chimney).

Some bushwacking is necessary, but with close attention it can be kept to a minimum. Scramble up between the cliffs. From here, follow the line of least resistance through the brush up the ridge. &lt;br&gt;I found that the cross-country travel was easiest by staying on the faint ridge to the south. This faint ridge curves to the north. From this point (ca. 6,800ft) the remaining routefinding is straightforward. This ridge meets up with some other spurs and becomes more prominent. Follow a series of game trails, staying directly on the ridge, with possibly excursions to either side (but staying within about 50 ft). &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;At 7,400 ft the shoulder of the north ridge is reached. There are some nice campsites here, but no water. From this point, head east across a clearing and the use-trail will become more prominent. It switchbacks across an open slope for 1,000 vertical feet until the slope tapers to a point, forcing the route north, directly onto the rocky west ridge. Stay on this class 2 ridge. Occasionally the route drops to one side or the other, but never further away than about 20 ft.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;At about 8,300 ft a prominent notch is reached. This is the top of the &lt;a href=\"http://www.summitpost.org/show/route_link.pl/route_id/1517/object_id/1396\"&gt;North Face Trail&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A ways further a large notch is encountered. You can do two things here:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Variation 1:&lt;/b&gt; After an easy class 3 downclimb, drop into the gulley to the south. &lt;br&gt;If one travels up this gulley to the saddle, they can reach the northernmost summit via some class 2 scrambling. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Variation 2:&lt;/b&gt; After descending into the notch, climb up the other side, starting to the right, working left, and then angling back right on some steep and solid class 4 rock. From there, wander your way to the north summit (cl. 3), occasionally wandering onto ledges on the north face.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The highest north summit can be reached from the saddle south of the northern summit via a class 4 chimney.&lt;br&gt;If one traverses south past the next set of cliffs,  the highest north summit can be gained by scrambling up a class 3 chute. Continue traversing to continue on the &lt;a href=\"http://www.summitpost.org/show/route_link.pl/route_id/4488/object_id/1396\"&gt;Summit Traverse&lt;/a&gt; route. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_3\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Essential Gear&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;br&gt;Sturdy boots and 10 Essentials.

It is a long ridge with nice views of Parleys Canyon and the summits between Millcreek Canyon and Big Cottonwood Canyon.  Because the route has minimal bushwacking and is almost entirely cross-country, it can be rather nice to do for the solitude that it can offer. In the winter the ridge is mostly free of avalanche danger and can serve as a good fallback option for snowshoeing when the avalanche danger is high.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I prefer to start the route by ascending the &lt;a href=\"http://www.summitpost.org/show/route_link.pl/route_id/2040/object_id/2099\"&gt;West Ridge&lt;/a&gt; of Granduer Pk. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;u&gt;Salt Lake Foothills - Grandeur Pk&lt;/u&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Distance:&lt;/b&gt; 2.15 Miles&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Elevation Change:&lt;/b&gt; +3275\'  -0\'&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;font color=\"blue\"&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;b&gt;Grandeur Pk-Church Fork Pk&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This is one of the more rugged sections of the ridge.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;From the summit, follow the Church Fork Trail down a short ways until the ridge can be easily gained. This can be done earlier through some routefinding and light bushwacking. Another alternative is to stay on the Church Fork trail until the first big switchback. From there one can find an abandoned trail that switchbacks up the slope to rejoin the ridge just below Church Fork Pk. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In the winter one can just stick religiously to the ridge all the way from the summit since the brush is mostly covered. If this option is done, brush and cliffs will necessitate dropping to the south about 100 ft for a short segment.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Distance:&lt;/b&gt; 2.28 Miles&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Elevation Change:&lt;/b&gt; +1164\'  -1128\'&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;font color=\"blue\"&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;b&gt;Church Fork Pk - Mt Aire Saddle - Mt Aire&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Follow the rolling ridge down to the Mt Aire saddle.

Leave the trail and continue along the ridgeline all the way to the saddle to Lambs Canyon. This is the most rugged part of the ridge, with some class 2 scrambling and the ascent of a pk I\'ve dubbed Snowdrift Pk before reaching the Lambs Canyon saddle.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;At the saddle a trail is reached that can be followed to the summit of Millvue Pk.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;u&gt;Mt Aire - Lambs Canyon Saddle&lt;/u&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Distance:&lt;/b&gt; 1.79 Miles&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Elevation Change:&lt;/b&gt; +643\'  -1062\'&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;u&gt;Lambs Canyon Saddle - Millvue Pk&lt;/u&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Distance:&lt;/b&gt; 0.64 Miles&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Elevation Change:&lt;/b&gt; +748\'  -0\'&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;font color=\"blue\"&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;b&gt;Millvue Pk - Murdock Pk&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Follow the ridgeline all the way to Murdock Pk.

The existence of a clear runout below and an easy approach makes this a fine snowclimb.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Take the Butler Fork trail. Make sure to take the west (left) drainage when the trail forks. Soon after this a saddle is reached, followed by a traverse across the base on Gobblers Knob along the Desolation Trail. This circumvents Mill A Basin.  &lt;br&gt;Once you are below the series of rocky ribs, head up the chutes. The 2nd one from the left takes you directly up to the summit via a constantly 30 degree broad chute.

Park here and being hiking up the main trail.&lt;br&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_2\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Route Description&lt;/h2&gt;For some bizarre reason this little bump at the end of a ridge spur has been named, although it is hardly a peak.   It still is noteworthy, though, in that it has excellent views of the south side of Big Cottonwood Canyon from the \'summit\' and can be a fun variation for the Butler Fork route up Mt Raymon or Gobblers Knob.  This peak in istelf is short and can make a good steep jaunt if you only have part of a day or if the avalanche danger is high.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;font color=\"gray\"&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;u&gt;SE Ridge&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br&gt;Head up the Butler Fork trail. Cross the river to the west and head up the opposite slopes at whatever point one so desires.  When I did this route, I crossed the river about 10 minutes from the TH.&lt;br&gt;The slope starts out steep and the grade is mostly sustained until the summit.  The terrain gradually becomes a more well-defined ridge and the trees clear out, affording nice views for most of the route.  &lt;br&gt;From the summit one can descend the same route or rejoin the Butler Fork route on the Desolation Trail via the North Ridge.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;font color=\"gray\"&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;u&gt;N Ridge&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br&gt;Take the Butler Fork Trail. The take the left spur when the canyon forks to join the Desolation Trail.  Once an obvious saddle is gained, turn off from the trail and head south on a ridge spur. This ridge is mostly flat with a small rise at the end, which is the \'summit\'.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;noformat&gt;&lt;table&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;div align=\"center\" class=\"image\" style=\"width: 106px;\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"/from-the-summit-of/97654\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"From the  summit  of...\" height=\"37\" width=\"100\" src=\"/images/thumb/97654.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=\"caption\"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/noformat&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_3\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Essential Gear&lt;/h2&gt;10 Essentials and Snowshoes.&lt;br&gt;There is no real avalanche danger on this route.&lt;br&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_4\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Miscellaneous Info&lt;/h2&gt;If you have information about this route that doesn\'t pertain to any of the other sections, please add it here.&lt;br&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_5\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Images&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div align=\"center\"&gt;&lt;table id=\"my_images\"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/from-the-summit-of/97654/c-163772\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"From the \\\'summit\\\' of...\" src=\"/images/square/97654.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/powder/602412/c-163772\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Powder\" src=\"/images/square/602412.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/article&gt;date:'),(272,163776,'/north-cleft/163776','/lembert-dome/151389','North Cleft','','','Class 3+ to class 4','','',2397,37.88,-119.35,'California, United States, North America','','',151389,'Lembert Dome','','0.8','Scramble','','Less than two hours','Route','content: &lt;article&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_1\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2 id=\"first_h2\"&gt;Approach&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;br&gt;Approach from the parking lot west of the rock.

The route has some loose scree, as well as some loose plates of granite on the middle portion, but otherwise the rock is solid.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The route begins as a friction climb on undulating granite.

Hike up the road just to the west of the Guard Station and East of some garages. The road winds up through private property for 1/4 mile. Continue hiking on the road for 3/4 mile to a junction. Go left at the junction to begin the single track trail to Cardiff Pass. It is 1 1/2 miles to Cardiff pass from the Guard station with a gain of 1360 ft.&lt;br&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_2\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Route Description&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;br&gt;This is one of the finer scrambling routes in the Wasatch, and with the short approach, it is a great route to do if you want some good scrambling and a short climb.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The route can be made easier by cheating and staying low from the ridge, but since class 3 terrain will be encountered nonetheless, you might as well have fun and stay right on the ridge.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;From Cardiff Pass follow a faint track north east along the north side of the rocky buttress. After about 50 ft there are some class 3 ledges that lead to the top of the small buttress. The route mostly stays just a little to the south of the ridgeline as it ascends a series of ledges and chimneys.  The rock is solid and many variations abound with the many ledges, cracks, aretes, and dihedrals - in fact this route can be treated as a bouldering problem, with some optional sections offering some fun 4th and low 5th class scrambling. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Eventually a false summit is gained.  From here the route finding is simple -take the line of least resistance along the ridge to an obviously higher point to the east. This is the \'summit\' of Flagstaff Pk marked on USGS topos.  Don\'t cheat by stopping here. Continue along a faint trail heading north from here to the higher summit of the mountain.&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;table class=\"inline_image_thumbs\"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=74599\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/74599.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=74601\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/74601.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=111125\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/111125.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_3\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Stats&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Distance:&lt;/b&gt; 1.84 mi (1-way)&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Elevation Gain:&lt;/b&gt; 2,108\'&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Steepness:&lt;/b&gt; 1,146 ft/mi&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Trailhead Elevation:&lt;/b&gt; 8,675\'&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;(REAL/North) Summit Elevation:&lt;/b&gt; 10,561\'&lt;br&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_4\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Essential Gear&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;u&gt;Summer&lt;/u&gt;&lt;br&gt;10 Essentials&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;u&gt;Winter&lt;/u&gt;&lt;br&gt;Snowshoes.

The trailhead is located 4.5 miles up Big Cottonwood Canyon from the intersection of Wasatch Blvd at the mouth of the canyon. There is a parking lot on the righthand side of the road for the trailhead, as well as the trailhead for the Broad\'s Fork approach to Twin Peaks, Sunrise, &amp;amp; Dromedary peaks. The trail is located just past the restrooms on the east side of the lot and follows a paved trail for 1/4 of a mile.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;font color=\"blue\"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Broads Fork TH&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br&gt;This trailhead is located at the same parking lot as the Mill B Trailhead, but it begins on the west side of the parking lot.&lt;br&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_2\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Stats&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;u&gt;via Lake Blanche&lt;/u&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Distance:&lt;/b&gt; 4.45 mi (1-way)&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Elevation Gain:&lt;/b&gt; 5,072\'&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Slope:&lt;/b&gt; 1,140 ft/mi&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;u&gt;via Broads Fork&lt;/u&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Distance:&lt;/b&gt; 4.5 mi (1-way)&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Elevation Gain:&lt;/b&gt; 5,130\'&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Slope:&lt;/b&gt; 1,140 ft/mi&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;TH Elevation:&lt;/b&gt; 6,200 ft&lt;br&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_3\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;via Lake Blanche&lt;/h2&gt;While on the paved portion a tributary comes in from the south and a trail breaks off from the pavement here. Follow the trail through nice meadows and beautiful views of Mill B Canyon.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;(Note: At one point one will see an enomrous smooth slab that is extruded up above the trees on the west side of the canyon. This slab provides many variations of some low 5th class climbing. Be sure to bring your microstoppers!&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Eventually Lake Blanche is reached. Follow the trail along the north side of the lake. The trail becomes more faint, but be sure to continue following along the north side of Lake Florence and Lake Lillian.  Cross the dam at Lake Lillian, cross the gulley, and head up the subtle ridge. From here just follow the series of rock slabs, initially heading south but gradually turning farther west.  If one is careful with routefinding, the bushwacking is almost non-existent. For those who aren\'t, better bring long pants!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;At ca. 9,300 ft, drop to the north of the ridge and head up a large bowl.  The ridge can be reached by scrambling along an angled wall of rock along the right-most side of the bowl (cl. 2-3) .  Follow the ridge to the base of Dromedary Pk. From here one can take either the Northeast Face or the North Ridge.&lt;br&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_4\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;via Broads Fork&lt;/h2&gt;Follow the maintained trail as it cuts west and then winds its way into the Broads Fork drainage, making one switchback along the way. After hiking about a mile through spruce and fir forests, the trail crosses the stream on a sturdy bridge and continues its steep climb up the canyon, passing through stands of shady trees and sunny meadows. There are several times when the steepness eases up, but only temporarily.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Finally the lower meadow is reached at 8,240 feet (good campsite, but somewhat popular). From here the trail fades away, but keep to the use-trails that fork left to a stream crossing on improvised bridges. Follow the path as it climbs more rugged terrain (cl. 2) to the upper meadow, where one is surrounded by the towering masses of Mt Dromedary, Sunrise Pk, and the Broads Fork Twin Peaks. Head toward the notch between Sunrise Pk and Mt Dromedary as if you\'re climbing them this way. Then cut east across the bowl below the north face of Dromedary peak and scramble up a talus slope (cl. 2,  loose rock) to reach the base of the North Ridge.&lt;br&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_5\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Route Description&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;u&gt;Northeast Face&lt;/u&gt;&lt;br&gt;Circle around the eastern flanks of the peak until one comes across the faint hikers trail leading to the top. Follow this trail as it winds its way through the series of cliffs on the eastern slope to the summit (cl. 2-3).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Once above the saddle north of the peak, take care not to stray too far climber\'s left as there are some dangerous slabs further out on the face. I haven\'t done the route in a long while, but runbyu1\'s trip report below reminds me of my experiences on where to go and not to go on this face!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;noformat&gt;&lt;table&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;div align=\"center\" class=\"image\" style=\"width: 381px;\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"/route-up-dromedary-from-lake-blanche/815725\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Route Up Dromedary From Lake Blanche\" height=\"500\" width=\"375\" src=\"/images/medium/815725.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=\"caption\"&gt;Route Up Dromedary From Lake Blanche (in red)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;div align=\"center\" class=\"image\" style=\"width: 381px;\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"/another-shot-of-the-route/815727\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Another shot of the route\" height=\"500\" width=\"375\" src=\"/images/medium/815727.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=\"caption\"&gt;Click and zoom to view the red line at runbyu1\'s attempt at representing the easier route&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/noformat&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;u&gt;North Ridge&lt;/u&gt;&lt;br&gt;Continue heading more or less directly toward the NE corner of Mt Dromedary. If care is taken, a nice (but loose!) class 3+ route can be taken along this corner all the way to the summit.  It begins by traversing a series of sloping fields heading towards the N Face, with short segments of chimneys and ledges in between. About midway up the mountain the route angles back to the eastern flanks.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I came across this route when I got fed up trying to navigate the cliffs on the eastern slopes from above (having not ascended that way), and I headed straight down this line. This route is more exposed than the NE Face, but is solid enough if you are experienced at class 3-4 scrambling.&lt;br&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_6\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Essential Gear&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;u&gt;Summer&lt;/u&gt;&lt;br&gt;10 Essentials, possibly a helmet depending on the route taken.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;u&gt;Winter&lt;/u&gt;&lt;br&gt;Snowshoes or skis.

Not sure if the trail is gone now or what---I never did find the \"faint hikers trail\" mentioned.  Do you have to make it all the way to the Cottonwood ridge before finding it?  If so, a note should be made to stay low and below the rocks slabs and cliff bands.  It would not be the logical way but would keep people out of the very dangerous position I was in.  &lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td valign=\"bottom\" style=\"padding-top: 6px;\" colspan=\"2\"&gt;&lt;span style=\"font-size: 9px; color: #888;\"&gt;Posted Sep 23, 2012 12:57 pm&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;table border=\"0\" width=\"745\" class=\"messages\" style=\"margin-left: 30px;\"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td rowspan=\"4\" valign=\"top\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/styles/layout/reply_arrow.gif\"&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td width=\"110\" align=\"left\" valign=\"top\" style=\"padding-top: 6px;\"&gt;&lt;a name=\"458057\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a class=\"dis_user_lnk\" href=\"/users/pellucidwombat/12893\"&gt;PellucidWombat&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td valign=\"top\" style=\"padding-top: 6px;\"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Re: NE Face Route?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td align=\"right\" valign=\"top\" nowrap style=\"font-size: 10px;\"&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td valign=\"top\" rowspan=\"2\" align=\"left\" style=\"padding-top: 6px;\"&gt;&lt;p class=\"disc_avatar\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"/users/pellucidwombat/12893\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"PellucidWombat\" width=\"50\" height=\"50\" border=\"0\" src=\"/images/avatars/833128.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=\"font-size: 9px; color: #888;\"&gt;Hasn\'t voted&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td colspan=\"2\" style=\"padding-top: 6px;\"&gt;I haven\'t done the route since maybe 2003, but at the time I remember a faint trail. I can\'t recall if there were any cairns, but I do recall that it wasn\'t a clearly worn path - you had to look for signs of a good scrambling route and cleaner rock, and sometimes signs of traveled rock faded in and out, so it could easily be harder to find now if it hasn\'t been tracked as much after the winter snows. However, there are places where you wouldn\'t want to fall even if the terrain is class 2-3, so you could have still been on route and not comfortable without a rope, although the farther climber\'s right (west) you are, the more likely you would be off route and in 5th class terrain!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I\'ve done the route as a descent to Big Cottonwood and have done the Cottonwood Ridge Traverse and I\'m positive that you don\'t go all the way to Cottonwood Ridge for this route. However, the terrain generally was harder to climb closer to the north face, so if in doubt, one should look for ways to climb closer to the Cottonwood Ridge.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Although I haven\'t been there in a good while and so my memory of any potential climbing barriers is not reliable (I recall that area having some tricky routefinding around The Sundial to avoid cliffs and bad bushwacking), I believe you could always traverse to the Cottonwood Ridge as you mentioned if you wanted to . . . it\'s just a slightly more roundabout way to get to the summit.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;---&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Additional: Actually, after reading your report and looking at your photo from Lake Blanche, I\'d say the traversing option only works just before the N Ridge suddenly gets steeper. I had forgotten about those slabs between the N Ridge and the Cottonwood Ridge midway up that side. Those are not the place to be!&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td valign=\"bottom\" style=\"padding-top: 6px;\" colspan=\"2\"&gt;&lt;span style=\"font-size: 9px; color: #888;\"&gt;Posted Sep 23, 2012 2:41 pm&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;table border=\"0\" width=\"775\"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;table cellpadding=\"2\" cellspacing=\"2\" width=\"100%\"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;&lt;span class=\"pagertext\"&gt;Viewing: &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;-&lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt; of &lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td align=\"center\"&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td align=\"right\"&gt;    &lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_9\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Images&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div align=\"center\"&gt;&lt;table id=\"my_images\"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/north-face-of-dromedary/829698/c-163920\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"North Face of Dromedary\" src=\"/images/square/829698.JPG\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/another-shot-of-the-route/815727/c-163920\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Another shot of the route\" src=\"/images/square/815727.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/descending/829695/c-163920\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"descending\" src=\"/images/square/829695.JPG\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/north-face-cliffs/829696/c-163920\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"North Face Cliffs\" src=\"/images/square/829696.JPG\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/article&gt;date:'),(275,163924,'/bullion-divide/163924','/american-fork-twin-peaks/151755','Bullion Divide','','','','','',11917,40.5679,-111.637,'Utah, United States, North America','','',151755,'American Fork Twin Peaks','Class 3','1.0','Hiking, Scrambling','Spring, Summer, Fall','Most of a day','Route','content: &lt;article&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_1\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2 id=\"first_h2\"&gt;Approach&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;font color=\"blue\"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Albion Basin/Cecret Lake TH&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br&gt;Take the 6200 South exit (exit #6) off I-215 and follow highway 190 south-east approximately 2 miles to the intersection with Big Cottonwood Canyon road.

Because the route is a ridgerun one does not arrive at the same TH that one had departed. Because of this, a car shuttle needs to be set up. The more ambitious hiker will begin at the White Pine TH for more elevation gain, but the route is mostly done from E-W from the Cecret Lake TH. Because of this, the route will be described heading E-W.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;font color=\"blue\"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Cecret Lake TH - Sugarloaf Pk&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Distance:&lt;/b&gt; 1.37 mi&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Elevation Change:&lt;/b&gt; +1,641\'   -0\'&lt;br&gt;Take the &lt;a href=\"http://www.summitpost.org/show/route_link.pl/route_id/4109/object_id/3430\"&gt;East Ridge&lt;/a&gt; route to the summit of Sugarloaf Pk. This is steep but follows a maintained trail to Cecret Lake and then a well-defined use-trail to the saddle between Sugarloaf Pk &amp;amp; Devil\'s Castle. (cl. 1-2)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;font color=\"blue\"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Sugarloaf Pk - Mt Baldy&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Distance:&lt;/b&gt; 0.76 mi&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Elevation Change:&lt;/b&gt; +513\'  -465\'&lt;br&gt;Descend the &lt;a href=\"http://www.summitpost.org/show/route_link.pl/route_id/4109/object_id/3430\"&gt;North Ridge&lt;/a&gt; of Sugarloaf Pk to a saddle. This route goes through some brush on the west side of Sugarloaf Pk as it descends base-ball size scree. Once at the saddle, hike along the beginnings of a ridge to the NE of a ski lift coming out of Mineral Basin. A use-trail becomes apparent. Ascend this trail to the summit. (cl. 2)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;font color=\"blue\"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Mt Baldy - Hidden Pk&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Distance:&lt;/b&gt; 0.7 mi&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Elevation Change:&lt;/b&gt; +341\'  -376\'&lt;br&gt;Head down the SW side of Mt Baldy. When the saddle is reached, either use the cat-track roads or stay on a use-trail that keeps to the ridge. Hike up to the Snowbird Tram atop \"not-so-hidden\" Hidden Pk. &lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://www.summitpost.org/mountains/user_link.pl?user_id=19993\"&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;i&gt;Ammon&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;small&gt;&lt;i&gt;adds:\"Also, just because hidden peak has a pay phone and running water on it doesn\'t mean it doesn\'t deserve to have a mountain page (hehehe...) \"&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;font color=\"blue\"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Hidden Pk - American Fork Twin Pks&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Distance:&lt;/b&gt; 1.13 mi&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Elevation Change:&lt;/b&gt; +843\'  -392\'&lt;br&gt;Descend the cat-track on the west side of Hidden Pk.  Eventually this cat-track splits at a rocky ridge. The left fork heads into Mineral Basin. The right fork heads into Gad Valley. Take neither road, but head straight up a use-trail that follows the spine of this ridge. This becomes the &lt;a href=\"http://www.summitpost.org/mountains/route_link.pl?route_id=4502&amp;amp;route_name=Northeast+Ridge&amp;amp;mountain_name=American+Fork+Twin+Peaks&amp;amp;object_id=2103&amp;amp;option=3&amp;amp;x=21&amp;amp;y=5\"&gt;North East Ridge&lt;/a&gt; route.  Some fun and mildy exposed scrambling is encountered (cl. 3) before the prominent ridge is absorbed into the east side of the American Fork Twin Pks. From there, it is just a talus slog to the shorter eastern summit and a stroll to the higher western summit.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;font color=\"blue\"&gt;&lt;u&gt;American Fork Twin Pks - Red Top&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Distance:&lt;/b&gt; 0.29 mi&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Elevation Change:&lt;/b&gt; +140\'  -219\'&lt;br&gt;From the summit of the American Fork Twins it is just a hop and a skip on some talus to reach the summit of Red Top (aka. Red Stack)(cl. 1-2).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;font color=\"blue\"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Red Top - Red Baldy&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Distance:&lt;/b&gt; 0.89 mi&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Elevation Change:&lt;/b&gt; +518\'  -780\'&lt;br&gt;Descend the West Ridge of Red Top (cl. 1-2) to the saddle and ascend the &lt;a href=\"http://www.summitpost.org/show/route_link.pl/route_id/2232/object_id/2353\"&gt;East Ridge&lt;/a&gt; of Red Baldy (cl. 3).  This takes you over a small buttress to the south and then up a nice but loose scramble up a knife-edge ridge to the summit.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;font color=\"blue\"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Red Baldy - White Baldy&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Distance:&lt;/b&gt; 1.08 mi&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Elevation Change:&lt;/b&gt; +657\'  -510\'&lt;br&gt;Head over the shorter west summit of Red Baldy and descend the &lt;a href=\"http://www.summitpost.org/show/route_link.pl/route_id/2231/object_id/2353\"&gt;West Ridge&lt;/a&gt; (cl. 2).  The red quartzite rock gives way to granite blocks as one nears White Baldy. Ascend the &lt;a href=\"http://www.summitpost.org/show/route_link.pl/route_id/2278/object_id/2209\"&gt;East Ridge&lt;/a&gt; (cl. 3) to the summit.  The route begins as a class 2 scramble on large granite blocks, initially on the north side of the ridge and then dropping to the south side. The final portion of the ridge to the summit is a solid class 3 scramble.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;font color=\"blue\"&gt;&lt;u&gt;White Baldy - White Pine TH&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Distance:&lt;/b&gt; 4.55 mi&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Elevation Change:&lt;/b&gt; +20\'  -3,648\'&lt;br&gt;Scramble along the ridge to the lower west summit. The rock becomes more loose here.  Descend the &lt;a href=\"http://www.summitpost.org/show/route_link.pl/route_id/2041/object_id/2209\"&gt;North West Ridge&lt;/a&gt;. This ridge is very tedious, filled with large blocks that require constant detours (cl. 2-3).  Once the large gendarms are reached, either drop to the south to perservere to meet up with the route up the Pfeifferhorn, or declare that you\'ve had enough for the day and drop directly to Upper Red Pine Lake. Head down the canyon. If one makes sure to stay to the east (right) of Red Pine Lake, the maintained trail will be found. From there it is an easy hike down to the trailhead.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_4\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Essential Gear&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;u&gt;Summer&lt;/u&gt;&lt;br&gt;10 Essentials.

A nice creek and a beautiful waterfall are nice sites along the way. The higher one goes, the more rugged the trail gets. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;At one point the trail forks, with the right route being less well maintained (?? mi, 8,300ft). Go right. This trail heads towards the north cirque of Box Elder Pk, and at 9,800ft the trail turns south and circumvents the peak.  Stay on the trail until after it crosses over a very broad, flat ridge. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Beyond the ridge one can really ascend anywhere along the open grassy south slopes of the peak. These slopes are covered with huge stepped grades carved into the hillside. These were built to control erosion and allow plant life to grow back after the devastating effects of overgrazing allowed by early settlers. Until mid-summer there are usually some tongues of avalanche debris in the drainages that can provide good snow climbs and the possibility of a glissade while the rest of the hillside is bare. The route up to the summit is straightforward, and if you\'re lucky, you\'ll encounters hordes of ladybugs or mountain goats.&lt;br&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_4\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Essential Gear&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;u&gt;Summer&lt;/u&gt;&lt;br&gt;10 Essentials. A stream provides a good source to refill water on the first half of the route.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;u&gt;Winter&lt;/u&gt;&lt;br&gt;Snowshoes or skis. Ice axe.

Gendarmes along the ridge will create some route finding difficulties, with the need to bypass them around the north and south, but generally the route stays true to the ridge. There is never a need to get further than about 100\' away from the ridge. If a bypassing route seems to go further away than that, then that is not the way to go. In general it is more common to drop to the north to bypass obstacles.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The technical crux is a well protected chimney with a chockstone at the top, requiring some stretching to reach the footholds lower down. Most of the route has enough exposure to keep it thrilling, and the rock is very solid.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As one nears the summit, scramble up the ledges just slightly north of the ridge until the summit is reached.&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;table class=\"inline_image_thumbs\"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=93135\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/93135.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=93134\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/93134.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_3\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Stats&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Distance:&lt;/b&gt; ca. 1 mile&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Elevation Gain/Loss:&lt;/b&gt; ca.+/-500 ft&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_4\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Essential Gear&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;br&gt;10 Essentials, sturdy boots, helmet.&lt;br&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_5\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Miscellaneous Info&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;br&gt;If you have information about this route that doesn\'t pertain to any of the other sections, please add it here.&lt;br&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_6\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Images&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div align=\"center\"&gt;&lt;table id=\"my_images\"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/michael-watches-mark-climb/93134/c-163990\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Michael watches Mark climb...\" src=\"/images/square/93134.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/here-the-knife-edged/93135/c-163990\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Here the knife-edged...\" src=\"/images/square/93135.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/article&gt;date:'),(278,163992,'/horton-lakes/163992','/south-basin-peak-pt-13-240/153693','Horton Lakes','','','Class 2','','',2779,37.2914,-118.673,'California, United States, North America','','',153693,'South Basin Peak (pt. 13,240\')','','0.0','Hike/Scramble','','Most of a day','Route','content: &lt;article&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_1\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2 id=\"first_h2\"&gt;Approach&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;br&gt;Begin from the Horton Lakes Trailhead described on the main page.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;From the gate, begin hiking along the old mining road as it switchbacks up into Horton Creek Canyon.

Take this chute all the way to the top, where you will end up on the summit plateau, just a short ways north from the summit.&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;table class=\"inline_image_thumbs\"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=90332\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/90332.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=90334\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/90334.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_3\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Stats&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Distance:&lt;/b&gt; TBA&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Elevation Gain:&lt;/b&gt; TBA&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Slope:&lt;/b&gt; TBA&lt;br&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_4\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Essential Gear&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;br&gt;10 Essentials, helmet.&lt;br&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_5\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Miscellaneous Info&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;br&gt;If you have information about this route that doesn\'t pertain to any of the other sections, please add it here.&lt;br&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_6\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Images&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div align=\"center\"&gt;&lt;table id=\"my_images\"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/the-east-ridge-route-is-shown/90332/c-163998\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"The East Ridge route is shown...\" src=\"/images/square/90332.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/the-east-ridge-route-shown/90334/c-163998\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"The East Ridge route shown...\" src=\"/images/square/90334.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/article&gt;date:'),(281,164300,'/north-ridge/164300','/pfeifferhorn/151177','North Ridge','','','5.5 A0 II-III','','',15435,40.5337,-111.705,'Utah, United States, North America','','',151177,'Pfeifferhorn','','0.8','Technical Rock Climb, mixed climb','','Most of a day','Route','content: &lt;article&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_1\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2 id=\"first_h2\"&gt;Route Overview&lt;/h2&gt;The North Ridge of the Pfeifferhorn is considered one of the best mountaineering routes in Utah. Although the route is plagued with loose rock, the easy access and aesthetic line make this a popular mountaineering route, regularly led by local &lt;a href=\"http://www.exum.ofutah.com/Pages/mountaineering.htm\"&gt;Exum&lt;/a&gt; guides. The route is briefly featured in Falcon\'s &lt;a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0762727306/qid=1110828344/sr=8-1/ref=sr_8_xs_ap_i1_xgl14/103-3510014-6848613?v=glance&amp;amp;s=books&amp;amp;n=507846\"&gt;Rock Climbing the Wasatch Range&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;hr width=\"80%\"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://www.summitpost.org/mountains/photo_link.pl/p/photo_id__149836__object_id__1236__type__mountain__mountain_id__1236__route_id____user_id____order_by____limit__\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"http://www.summitpost.org/images/original/101604.jpg\" width=\"640\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;table class=\"inline_image_thumbs\"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=101158\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/101158.JPG\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=94970\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/94970.JPG\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=94972\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/94972.JPG\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=94975\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/94975.JPG\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_2\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Approach&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;font color=\"blue\"&gt;&lt;b&gt;White Pine TH&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt;  - &lt;b&gt;7,704\'&lt;/b&gt;  &lt;br&gt;Take the 6200 South exit (exit #6) off I-215 and follow highway 190 south-east approximately 2 miles to the intersection with Big Cottonwood Canyon road. Continue straight through the stoplight and follow the road another 4 miles to the mouth of Little Cottonwood Canyon, where an electronic billboard on the right provides current road and/or weather conditions. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Drive 5.5 miles up Little Cottonwood Canyon (0.7 miles before Snowbird Ski Resort) approximately 30 min from Salt Lake City. There are signs marking the turnoff on the south side of the road for the trailhead parking lot. The turnoff is just past a turn in the road and is easy to miss. The turnoff for the Tanner\'s Flat campground is passed first, and then begin slowing down once you see the \"White Pine Slide Area\" sign.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;u&gt;Stats&lt;/u&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Distance:&lt;/b&gt; 4 miles&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Elevation Gain:&lt;/b&gt; 2,700\'&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Take the White Pine trail across the river, and follow the old dirt road/trail as it traverses west before arcing up into White Pine Canyon. At the first switchback (1 mile) there is a more faint but still well-used trail crossing White Pine Canyon stream. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Take this trail to reach Red Pine Canyon. This trail climbs out of White Pine Canyon and continues traversing west before arcing up Red Pine Canyon. Just as the trail reaches the Red Pine Canyon stream and the terrain flattens, there is an even more faint trail crossing the stream (2.5 miles). This trail heads into Maybird Gulch. Beware, this turnoff is easy to miss, especially in the winter when the sign and the bridge are covered in snow.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The trail arcs around the rugged ridgeline dividing Red Pine Canyon and Maybird Gulch and heads up the eastern side of the Gulch. From here one is treated with the first views of the Pfeifferhorn. To the right is &lt;a href=\"http://www.summitpost.org/mountains/photo_link.pl/p/photo_id__140933__object_id__13451__type__user__mountain_id____route_id____user_id____order_by____limit__\"&gt;pt. 10,516&lt;/a&gt;, which has a rather interesting summit block spire. To the left is a dramatic rock feature I\'ve dubbed the &lt;a href=\"http://www.summitpost.org/mountains/photo_link.pl/p/photo_id__140956__object_id__13451__type__user__mountain_id____route_id____user_id____order_by____limit__\"&gt;Maybird Palisades&lt;/a&gt;. These offer some possible fun top-roping crack and dihedral climbs.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Soon once reaches the open bowl at the top of Maybird Gulch. The &lt;a href=\"http://www.summitpost.org/show/route_link.pl/route_id/1593/object_id/1236\"&gt;East Ridge&lt;/a&gt; route lies just ahead. From here you can take either the Full Route or one of the Couloir Variations.&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;table class=\"inline_image_thumbs\"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=94826\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/94826.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=94824\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/94824.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=94828\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/94828.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=94829\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/94829.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=94830\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/94830.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_3\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Route Description&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;u&gt;Stats&lt;/u&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Distance:&lt;/b&gt; 1 mile&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Elevation Gain:&lt;/b&gt; 1,300\'&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A general note: The lower part of the Full Route has harder technical rock than the Couloir Routes and in its entirety is quite a bit longer. The Couloir Routes might be a better idea if time is an issue or you want to combine a steep snow/neve climb with a rock climb. But beware - the Couloir Routes are on a north east aspect and are therefore highly &lt;big&gt;&lt;font color=\"red\"&gt;AVALANCHE PRONE&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/big&gt; and should only be climbed when conditions are safe!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Because of the loose rock encountered on the route, it is recommended to be climbed in the winter when the rocks are frozen in place. Of course, during Utah\'s frequent warm thaws, climbing in the winter just makes the route harder with no extra security from loose rock.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;u&gt;Full Variation: Lower&lt;/u&gt;&lt;br&gt;From the &lt;a href=\"http://www.summitpost.org/mountains/photo_link.pl?photo_id=140934&amp;amp;object_id=1236&amp;amp;type=mountain&amp;amp;mountain_id=1236&amp;amp;route_id=\"&gt;Maybird Gulch bowl&lt;/a&gt;, cut across the open terrain toward the ridge joining the Pfeifferhorn and pt. 10,516. Aim for the southern saddle (of the two saddles) in the ridge.  The slope climbs 35&lt;sup&gt;o&lt;/sup&gt;-40&lt;sup&gt;o&lt;/sup&gt; for  about 80 feet to reach the saddle. You should make sure to have all your gear out and ready before this part, or right at the saddle. Beyond this point there really aren\'t any good places to rummage in your pack!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The ridge starts out mild, with steep snow slopes dropping down into Maybird Gulch and Hogum Fork. Soon, the slopes to the left steepen, and cliffs appear on the &lt;a href=\"http://www.summitpost.org/mountains/photo_link.pl?photo_id=140942&amp;amp;object_id=1236&amp;amp;type=mountain&amp;amp;mountain_id=1236&amp;amp;route_id=\"&gt;right&lt;/a&gt;. Beware the occasional cornice as you climb this part. You might want to be roped up to simul-climb this part.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;After a while of class 3-4 scrambling, an exposed knife edge is reached, with a sharp &lt;a href=\"http://www.summitpost.org/mountains/photo_link.pl?photo_id=140944&amp;amp;object_id=1236&amp;amp;type=mountain&amp;amp;mountain_id=1236&amp;amp;route_id=\"&gt;gendarme&lt;/a&gt; blocking progress. The spine of the gendarme is easier to climb than it appears (there are some small ledges for your feet on the right side), but once at the top, you must either downclimb some scary cracks to the left (5.5 R), an overhang to the right, or rappel the 10 ft into the notch. As there is really no way to protect this part and a large pendulum is possible (not the best to experience when simul-climbing), most parties rapell this section.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Beyond the gendarme is a steep series of class 4 ledges that wind around to the sheer east side of another much larger gendarme. Just as you reach the end of the ledges and the beginning of the featureless rock and sheer corner, &lt;a href=\"http://www.summitpost.org/mountains/photo_link.pl?photo_id=140955&amp;amp;object_id=1236&amp;amp;type=mountain&amp;amp;mountain_id=1236&amp;amp;route_id=\"&gt;traverse&lt;/a&gt; south along the east face of the gendarme. This traverse is &lt;i&gt;SCARY&lt;/i&gt; as the rock is smooth with no secure holds, and in the winter is is plastered with verglass and sugar snow. Perhaps to aid Exum guided climbs on the route, there is a fixed line across this part. It begins on a piton of questionable integrity, passes through a bolt, and then heads straight up the slab to a final bolt, beyond which is a short but steep and exposed snow climb on VERY loose snow. This section is best done on a belay with the second clipped in to the questionable piton, with the leader also clipped to the fixed line. A quickdraw at each bolt provides greater security, and depending on snow and ice cover, one may need to pull on the rope on parts of the traverse.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Beyond the gendarme is some exposed class 4 scrambling to reach a prominent notch between the second gendarme and the first buttress. This is where the Couloir Variation B tops out.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;u&gt; Couloir Variation A:&lt;/u&gt;&lt;br&gt;This variation is straigtforward. Cut across the open bowl of Maybird Gulch, and ascend the steep &lt;a href=\"http://www.summitpost.org/mountains/photo_link.pl?photo_id=140937&amp;amp;object_id=1236&amp;amp;type=mountain&amp;amp;mountain_id=1236&amp;amp;route_id=\"&gt;snow couloir&lt;/a&gt;. The lower 300-400 feet is about 30&lt;sup&gt;o&lt;/sup&gt; to 40&lt;sup&gt;o&lt;/sup&gt; steep. The couloir forks, take the left fork, where the terrain steepens to a little over 50&lt;sup&gt;o&lt;/sup&gt;. Near the top of the snow, angle to the right to climb through the jumbled rocks to gain the top of the First Buttress and gain the North Ridge Route.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;u&gt;Couloir Variation B:&lt;/u&gt;&lt;br&gt;This variation is straigtforward. Cut across the open bowl of Maybird Gulch, and ascend the steep &lt;a href=\"http://www.summitpost.org/mountains/photo_link.pl?photo_id=140937&amp;amp;object_id=1236&amp;amp;type=mountain&amp;amp;mountain_id=1236&amp;amp;route_id=\"&gt;snow couloir&lt;/a&gt;. The lower 300-400 feet is about 30&lt;sup&gt;o&lt;/sup&gt; to 40&lt;sup&gt;o&lt;/sup&gt; steep. The couloir forks, take the right fork and in another 100 ft a prominent &lt;a href=\"http://www.summitpost.org/mountains/photo_link.pl?photo_id=140949&amp;amp;object_id=1236&amp;amp;type=mountain&amp;amp;mountain_id=1236&amp;amp;route_id=\"&gt;notch&lt;/a&gt; is reached, and one can begin the technical rock climbing on the North Ridge up the First Buttress.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;u&gt;Upper North Ridge:&lt;/u&gt;&lt;br&gt;Ascend the &lt;a href=\"http://www.summitpost.org/mountains/photo_link.pl?photo_id=140946&amp;amp;object_id=1236&amp;amp;type=mountain&amp;amp;mountain_id=1236&amp;amp;route_id=\"&gt;first buttress&lt;/a&gt; by simul-climbing through the broken ledges above, which is mostly class 4 with one or two 5th class moves (5.0-5.2). At the top of the buttress, traverse the snow to the second buttress, composed of one small and one large rock wall. Go on the right side of the first wall across a broken slab (cl. 3). The second wall is easy to identify from lower down in Maybird Gulch by the  prominent lightning-bolt crack running up the face. Bypass this face by climbing around it to the east where the half pitch crux of the upper ridge will be encountered (5.3), followed by one more pitch (cl. 3-4).  Above this section, there is a steep snowclimb for the last  200 feet to the summit.&lt;br&gt;This upper section can be mostly simul-climbed, with only 2 pitches commonly being fully anchored and belayed. The difficulty is more consistent than the lower portion of the Full Route, and it is easier with the crux being 5.3, while the lower portion had some 5.5 sections.&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;table class=\"inline_image_thumbs\"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=94825\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/94825.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=94832\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/94832.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=94834\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/94834.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=94843\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/94843.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_4\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Descent&lt;/h2&gt;Descend the &lt;a href=\"http://www.summitpost.org/show/route_link.pl/route_id/1593/object_id/1236\"&gt;East Ridge&lt;/a&gt;  of the Pfeifferhorn. Once at the ridgeline separating American Fork Canyon and Maybird, there are two option depending on snow stability and party energy. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The easiest descent is to glissade 400-500\' down the steep north headwall down into the bowl of Maybird Gulch and backtrack the approach down Maybird Gulch.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The safer option when snow stability is questionable is to follow the East Ridge route to pt. 10,897. One can either follow the East Ridge route down and out via Red Pine (there is still a headwall here with high avalanche possibilities), or rather than traversing below this pt 10,897, head up to the point and descend the Maybird Palisade that divides Maybird and Red Pine. The back side is more mild, and apart from some short sections near the top, is completely avlanche free. The ridge involves class 3 scrambling above some dramatic cliffs. The ridge can be exited just short of where the Maybird Trail cuts into Red Pine.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://www.summitpost.org/mountains/user_link.pl?user_id=25913\"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Ibex&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt; adds:&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;This route can be skied from the summit during certain times of the year. There is a &lt;a href=\"http://www.summitpost.org/mountains/photo_link.pl?photo_id=151958&amp;amp;object_id=1236&amp;amp;type=mountain&amp;amp;mountain_id=1236&amp;amp;route_id=5005\"&gt;NorthWestern couloir&lt;/a&gt; that 3/4 of the way down that provides exit if you bring 2-60meter ropes. &lt;a href=\"http://fritzrips.com/v-web/bulletin/bb/viewtopic.php?t=79\"&gt;Pictures&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"http://fritzrips.com/pfeifflow.wmv\"&gt;video&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;table class=\"inline_image_thumbs\"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=103165\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/103165.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=112987\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/112987.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=94835\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/94835.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=94836\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/94836.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=94837\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/94837.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_5\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Essential Gear&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;u&gt;Technical Rack&lt;/u&gt;&lt;br&gt;Helmets are vary important due to the loose rock on the route. At a minumum, a rope is needed for simul-climbing. Some midsize cams or nuts would be helpful, depending on one\'s comfort level on the route. Also, for the full route, bring a sling to use for rapping (possibly retrieveable) and a runner and carabiner to use as a safety line connection to the fixed rope traverse.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;u&gt;Summer:&lt;/u&gt;&lt;br&gt;10 Essentials and good hiking boots. Water can be refilled at the Maybird Lakes, so little is needed.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;u&gt;Winter:&lt;/u&gt; &lt;br&gt;Skis/Snowshoes are can be helpful for the approach but are best left for retrieval in Maybird Gulch. An ice axe is needed for any of the variations in addition to the technical gear listed above. For Couloir Variation A, crampons and an extra axe or tool might be necessary, as well as some flukes or pickets, or ice screws, depending on the snow conditions.  Avalanche beacons and rescue gear are a must for ascending the Couloir variations or descending straight into Maybird Gulch.&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;table class=\"inline_image_thumbs\"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=94973\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/94973.JPG\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=94831\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/94831.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=94842\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/94842.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=94839\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/94839.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=94840\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/94840.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_6\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Miscellaneous Info&lt;/h2&gt;If you have information about this route that doesn\'t pertain to any of the other sections, please add it here.&lt;br&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_7\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Images&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div align=\"center\"&gt;&lt;table id=\"my_images\"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/march-12-2005-the/94826/c-164300\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"March 12, 2005 - The...\" src=\"/images/square/94826.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/north-ridge-pfiefferhorn-utah/466297/c-164300\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"North Ridge, Pfiefferhorn, Utah\" src=\"/images/square/466297.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/north-ridge-pfiefferhorn-utah/466292/c-164300\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"North Ridge, Pfiefferhorn, Utah\" src=\"/images/square/466292.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/north-ridge-pfiefferhorn-utah/466304/c-164300\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"North Ridge, Pfiefferhorn, Utah\" src=\"/images/square/466304.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/north-ridge-pfiefferhorn-utah/466305/c-164300\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"North Ridge, Pfiefferhorn, Utah\" src=\"/images/square/466305.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/north-ridge-pfiefferhorn-utah/466309/c-164300\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"North Ridge, Pfiefferhorn, Utah\" src=\"/images/square/466309.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/north-ridge-pfiefferhorn-utah/466293/c-164300\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"North Ridge, Pfiefferhorn, Utah\" src=\"/images/square/466293.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/north-ridge-pfiefferhorn-utah/466287/c-164300\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"North Ridge, Pfiefferhorn, Utah\" src=\"/images/square/466287.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/north-ridge-pfiefferhorn-utah/466300/c-164300\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"North Ridge, Pfiefferhorn, Utah\" src=\"/images/square/466300.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/north-ridge-pfiefferhorn-utah/466289/c-164300\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"North Ridge, Pfiefferhorn, Utah\" src=\"/images/square/466289.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/north-ridge-pfiefferhorn-utah/466288/c-164300\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"North Ridge, Pfiefferhorn, Utah\" src=\"/images/square/466288.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/north-ridge-pfiefferhorn-utah/466303/c-164300\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"North Ridge, Pfiefferhorn, Utah\" src=\"/images/square/466303.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/north-ridge-pfiefferhorn-utah/466299/c-164300\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"North Ridge, Pfiefferhorn, Utah\" src=\"/images/square/466299.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/north-ridge-pfiefferhorn-utah/466296/c-164300\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"North Ridge, Pfiefferhorn, Utah\" src=\"/images/square/466296.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td colspan=\"7\" align=\"center\"&gt;[ &lt;a href=\"/north-ridge/images/p-164300\"&gt;View Gallery - 39 More Images&lt;/a&gt; ]&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/article&gt;date:'),(282,165076,'/absent-minded-arete/165076','/mount-olympus/151263','Absent-Minded Arete','','','I 5.3','','',5727,40.657,-111.77,'Utah, United States, North America','','',151263,'Mount Olympus','','0.2','Scramble','','Most of a day','Route','content: &lt;article&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_1\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2 id=\"first_h2\"&gt;Approach&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;br&gt;Begin from the Mount Olympus Trail trailhead and head up the main trail. Pass Tolcat Canyon and Blister Hill. After the top of Blister Hill you begin to enter some groves of pine trees. After passing through a couple of these, you will enter a brief clearing to your right as the trail switchbacks left. From here, head up the clearing - the arete should be easy to see from here (it is the far one, with a separate rocky pillar to the right). Just head to the base and pick a starting point.&lt;br&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_2\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Route Description&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;br&gt;I discovered this route on one of my fores up Mt Olympus. Looking for something new, and to avoid the tedious final portion of the trail, I headed towards a rocky arete next to &lt;a href=\"http://www.summitpost.org/show/route_link.pl/route_id/4487/object_id/1396\"&gt;Forgotten Arete&lt;/a&gt; that led to the false summit just south of the trail. &lt;br&gt;_______________________________________________________&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;font color=\"red\"&gt;Warning:&lt;/font&gt; This route is not a very good one. I\'m posting it mostly to warn anyone curious about trying out the route. &lt;a href=\"http://www.summitpost.org/show/route_link.pl/route_id/4487/object_id/1396\"&gt;Forgotten Arete&lt;/a&gt; is a far superior route, so I can only imagine someone trying this variation if they\'re really wanting to try something new.&lt;br&gt;_______________________________________________________&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The route is roughly 700-800 vertical feet of sustained class 3 with some class 4 and low 5th class segments. The route can easily be abandoned by dropping into a chute to the north. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Head up the brushy wash that splits off from the main trail. Pass the chute heading left up to the minor summit and climb up the far rocky ridge as far to the south as possible.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The rock has a lot of loose lichen on it, and brush gets in the way often. There are also some loose rock chunks. In general, the route is not very exposed, except for a couple of key areas.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The final crux involves either a 4th to low 5th class scramble on some flakes and a face to the north (a fall would be fatal here), or a more protected 5.4 squeeze chimney to the south. Beyond this the rock eases up, and seemed to be mostly 3rd to 4th class for the last 100 ft. I got fed up with the route at this point and dropped into the chute to the north to summit, so I\'m not entirely sure.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_3\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Essential Gear&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;br&gt;Good sturdy shoes and the 10 Essentials. There is a fair amount of loose rock, so a helmet would be recommended. Long pants would also be recommended for the bushwacking.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Also, the crux sections are short and there is a lot of potential for rope drag, so the route is best if free-soloed.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_4\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Miscellaneous Info&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;br&gt;If you have information about this route that doesn\'t pertain to any of the other sections, please add it here.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/article&gt;date:'),(283,165264,'/salt-lake-slips/165264','/big-cottonwood-canyon/154148','Salt Lake Slips','','','5.6-5.10c','','',5833,40.6194,-111.787,'Utah, United States, North America','','',154148,'Big Cottonwood Canyon','','1.0','Sport, Trad - Single &amp; Multi Pitch','','Less than two hours','Route','content: &lt;article&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_1\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2 id=\"first_h2\"&gt;Approach&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;br&gt;Park 2.45 miles up the canyon from the neon sign at the Park N\' Ride. Use one of the pullouts from either side of the road. Drop down to the river from a point where you are directly across from the wall. At the river is a fixed line strung between trees that is crossed via a Tyrolean Traverse. Recently a foot line has been put up too, but it\'s not as fun &lt;img src=\"/message_board/images/laugh.gif\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\"&gt;.  &lt;p&gt;  The routes begin at an overhang at the far side of the river crossing. Follow the base of the cliffs right to reach the rest of the climbs.&lt;br&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_2\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Route Description&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;br&gt;This area is very popular and is often full on weekends. Nearby trees and the river keep the area cool while the east facing rock catches the morning sun. While the routes are close together, they can all be top roped at the same time. The rock is solid and steep, and the area hosts routes of a variety of difficulties. The climbing here is mostly sport.   &lt;p&gt;  During the winter the base of the main wall is used for praticing dry-tool traverses, while the dark chimney to the left of the Italian Arete is used for practicing dry-tooling on top rope (5.5-5.6).  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;table border=\"1\" cellspacing=\"0\"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;  &lt;table border=\"0\" cellspacing=\"2\" cellpadding=\"2\"&gt;    &lt;tr bgcolor=\"#c0c0c0\"&gt;&lt;td colspan=\"5\"&gt;&lt;font style=\"font-weight:bold;\"&gt;ROUTES OVERVIEW&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;  &lt;tr&gt;  &lt;td align=\"center\"&gt;&lt;font style=\"font-weight:bold;\"&gt;Route&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/td&gt;  &lt;td align=\"center\"&gt;&lt;font style=\"font-weight:bold;\"&gt;Difficulty&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/td&gt;  &lt;td align=\"center\"&gt;&lt;font style=\"font-weight:bold;\"&gt;Rating&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/td&gt;  &lt;td align=\"center\"&gt;&lt;font style=\"font-weight:bold;\"&gt;FA&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/td&gt;  &lt;td align=\"center\"&gt;&lt;font style=\"font-weight:bold;\"&gt;Trad/Sport&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/td&gt;    &lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;  &lt;td&gt;Salem\'s Lot&lt;/td&gt;  &lt;td align=\"center\"&gt;5.10c&lt;/td&gt;  &lt;td align=\"center\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"http://www.summitpost.org/images/stara.gif\"&gt;&lt;/td&gt;  &lt;td&gt;1992, Shane Willet &amp;amp; Mike Carnahan&lt;/td&gt;  &lt;td align=\"center\"&gt;Sp&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;    &lt;tr&gt;  &lt;td bgcolor=\"#e0e0e0\"&gt;Witchhunt&lt;/td&gt;  &lt;td bgcolor=\"#e0e0e0\" align=\"center\"&gt;5.10a&lt;/td&gt;  &lt;td bgcolor=\"#e0e0e0\" align=\"center\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"http://www.summitpost.org/images/stara.gif\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"http://www.summitpost.org/images/stara.gif\"&gt;&lt;/td&gt;  &lt;td bgcolor=\"#e0e0e0\"&gt;1992, Shane Willet &amp;amp; Mike Carnahan&lt;/td&gt;  &lt;td bgcolor=\"#e0e0e0\" align=\"center\"&gt;Sp&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;    &lt;tr&gt;  &lt;td&gt;Abracadabra&lt;/td&gt;  &lt;td align=\"center\"&gt;5.5&lt;/td&gt;  &lt;td align=\"center\"&gt;&lt;/td&gt;  &lt;td&gt;Unknown&lt;/td&gt;  &lt;td align=\"center\"&gt;Tr&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;    &lt;tr&gt;  &lt;td bgcolor=\"#e0e0e0\"&gt;Senseless Banter&lt;/td&gt;  &lt;td bgcolor=\"#e0e0e0\" align=\"center\"&gt;5.9+&lt;/td&gt;  &lt;td bgcolor=\"#e0e0e0\" align=\"center\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"http://www.summitpost.org/images/stara.gif\"&gt;&lt;/td&gt;  &lt;td bgcolor=\"#e0e0e0\"&gt;1990, Scott Unice &amp;amp; Julie Gustin&lt;/td&gt;  &lt;td bgcolor=\"#e0e0e0\" align=\"center\"&gt;Tr&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;    &lt;tr&gt;  &lt;td&gt;Forgotten Ambition&lt;/td&gt;  &lt;td align=\"center\"&gt;5.9&lt;/td&gt;  &lt;td align=\"center\"&gt;&lt;/td&gt;  &lt;td&gt;1990, Scott Unice &amp;amp; Julie Gustin&lt;/td&gt;  &lt;td align=\"center\"&gt;Tr&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;    &lt;tr&gt;  &lt;td bgcolor=\"#e0e0e0\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"#six\"&gt;Italian Arete&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;  &lt;td bgcolor=\"#e0e0e0\" align=\"center\"&gt;5.6&lt;/td&gt;  &lt;td bgcolor=\"#e0e0e0\" align=\"center\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"http://www.summitpost.org/images/stara.gif\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"http://www.summitpost.org/images/stara.gif\"&gt;&lt;/td&gt;  &lt;td bgcolor=\"#e0e0e0\"&gt;1992, Tony Calderone&lt;/td&gt;  &lt;td bgcolor=\"#e0e0e0\" align=\"center\"&gt;Sp&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;    &lt;tr&gt;  &lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"#seven\"&gt;Entre Nous&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;  &lt;td align=\"center\"&gt;5.8+&lt;/td&gt;  &lt;td align=\"center\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"http://www.summitpost.org/images/stara.gif\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"http://www.summitpost.org/images/stara.gif\"&gt;&lt;/td&gt;  &lt;td&gt;1989, Stuart Rickman &amp;amp; Libby Ellis&lt;/td&gt;  &lt;td align=\"center\"&gt;Sp&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;    &lt;tr&gt;  &lt;td bgcolor=\"#e0e0e0\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"#eight\"&gt;Thieving Magpie&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;  &lt;td bgcolor=\"#e0e0e0\" align=\"center\"&gt;5.7&lt;/td&gt;  &lt;td bgcolor=\"#e0e0e0\" align=\"center\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"http://www.summitpost.org/images/stara.gif\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"http://www.summitpost.org/images/stara.gif\"&gt;&lt;/td&gt;  &lt;td bgcolor=\"#e0e0e0\"&gt;1992, Paul Hodges &amp;amp; Ray Dahl&lt;/td&gt;  &lt;td bgcolor=\"#e0e0e0\" align=\"center\"&gt;Sp&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;    &lt;tr&gt;  &lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"#nine\"&gt;Roll the Bones&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;  &lt;td align=\"center\"&gt;5.6&lt;/td&gt;  &lt;td align=\"center\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"http://www.summitpost.org/images/stara.gif\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"http://www.summitpost.org/images/stara.gif\"&gt;&lt;/td&gt;  &lt;td&gt;1991, Ray Dahl &amp;amp; Paul Hodges&lt;/td&gt;  &lt;td align=\"center\"&gt;Sp&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;    &lt;tr&gt;&lt;td colspan=\"5\"&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;i&gt;Route overview information used from Stuart &amp;amp; Bret Ruckman\'s &lt;a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0762727306/summitpost-20/103-3515982-7251006\"&gt;Rock Climbing the Wasatch Range&lt;/a&gt;.

Start on the inside of a dihedal and climb straight for the arete. About 3/4 up, drop back into the left face of the arete to reach the bolted anchor. This section is usually then top-roped.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;  &lt;b&gt;Pitch #2:&lt;/b&gt; If one so wishes, a second pitch can be climbed from here, with a walkoff for descent.

There is no Tyrolean Traverse anymore. The best way to get by the river when it\'s high is a trail from Storm Mountain Picnic Area.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;2. My girlfriend and I had a rather unfortunate encounter with small hidden cacti on the top-out area. I\'ve never seen a warning about it anywhere, either. I think it would be great to have that included, as well. The closest image I could find is this: http://www.naturenorth.com/Garden/Cacti_pear1.jpg&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Hope this helps!&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td valign=\"bottom\" style=\"padding-top: 6px;\" colspan=\"2\"&gt;&lt;span style=\"font-size: 9px; color: #888;\"&gt;Posted May 22, 2015 4:56 pm&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;table border=\"0\" width=\"775\"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;table cellpadding=\"2\" cellspacing=\"2\" width=\"100%\"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;&lt;span class=\"pagertext\"&gt;Viewing: &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;-&lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt; of &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td align=\"center\"&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td align=\"right\"&gt;    &lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/article&gt;date:'),(284,165270,'/millstone-slab/165270','/big-cottonwood-canyon/154148','Millstone Slab','','','II 5.3 - Trad Multi-pitch, 5.7-5.11d Sport','','',3253,40.6194,-111.787,'Utah, United States, North America','','',154148,'Big Cottonwood Canyon','','0.8','Technical Climb','','Half a day','Route','content: &lt;article&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_1\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2 id=\"first_h2\"&gt;Approach&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;br&gt;Millstone Slab is a 600-800 ft long quartzite slab just a short ways up Mill Fork B.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Drive 4.2 miles up the canyon from the neon sign at the mouth of BCC. Park at the Broads Fork/Mill Fork B trailhead and head up the Mill Fork B trail toward Lake Blanche.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;About 1 mile up the trail a huge block of quartzite can be seen rising above the trees of the opposite side of the stream. Hike just past the rock and then cross the stream, climbing up the opposite hill on class 2 boulders. Angle right, and eventually cut through a short section of pine trees to reach the rock. There is an impenetrable wall surrounding the block, overhanging in many places. There are many sport routes found along this vertical to overhanging barrier.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For the multipitch route, follow this wall downhill, looking carefully for a break in the barrier. One should be found that is approximately class 4. I is approximately where the slab boundary jogs to the right before continuing downhill.

Hike down to the river and backtrack downstream. After passing a deep chimney, there is a broad ledge that rises from the ground. The route starts at the first point where this ledge levels off. The route can be rapped from above is so desired.    Climbing is on a smooth face with lots of ending and friction moves. The overhang at the top provides the crux for the route.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_4\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Take Me To The River - 5.7&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;br&gt;This route has many variations and is usually top roped since protection is tricky if not non-existent. The route ascends any good line on the western-most end of Dogwood Crag. Some variations can use bolted chains at the top, while other require anchoring off of trees up above.&lt;br&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_5\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Essential Gear&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;br&gt;Slings for bolted and natural anchors are all that are essential.

This wall has some of the canyon\'s finest climbs, with many crack systems and square holds. Loose rock is plentiful, so a helmet is advised. Also, be careful about dislodging rocks - they could conceivably reach the road! Another thing to consider is the noise from the river below - it can be nearly impossible to communicate with your partner on a climb. 2-way radios would be reccommended to avoid this problem.   &lt;p&gt;  The 5.7 Outside Corner is one of the finest of its grade in BCC, and it is the most famous route in this area.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;  I don\'t know the origins of the name of the wall, but I imagine that these were the words the climber was cursing as he was biking up the steep hill beneath the wall to reach the climbing routes in the area.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;

The final pitch has 2 variations.  &lt;p&gt;  &lt;b&gt;Pitch #1:&lt;/b&gt; (5.6) Start on the east side of the arete and work your way up a small crack system into a dihedral. You can also start a little further uphill and climb a chimney before cutting into the dihedral. There are two pitons you can clip into for pro. The pitch tops out on a ledge on the arete.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;  &lt;b&gt;Pitch #2:&lt;/b&gt; The relative exposure of the first pitch leaves you unprepared for this pitch as you are forced out onto the north face of the wall. The hillside drops further away on the west side of the arete, leaving a longer drop on this side. (5.6) Climb this short pitch on the arete, occasionally straying to the west. Soon a large flat ledge is reached on the arete. Set up the next belay here.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;  &lt;b&gt;Pitch #3:&lt;/b&gt; Some face climbing is encountered (5.7) followed by a large crack (5.6) that leads to the 3rd belay station known as \"The Cave\". It is a cave cut right into the arete and it is just big enough to comfortably seat two climbers.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;  &lt;b&gt;Pitch #4:&lt;/b&gt; This final pitch has two variations.&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;Variation A&lt;/i&gt; - (5.5) Climb out the far side of the cave onto the east face of the arete. Do an exposed traverse into a dihedral. As soon as is convenient, cut over into the next dihedral via an exposed traverse. Rope drag may force you to set up a belay on a chockstone here. Climb straight up to the top.&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;Variation B&lt;/i&gt; - (5.7) This is the more thrilling variation. Climb back out of the cave to the west for a final pitch of exposed 5.7 face climbing, navigating over and around several roofs. Enjoy!  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;  &lt;b&gt;Descent&lt;/b&gt;: Walk off to the west. Follow the rock spur that wraps around the pullout beside the road and pick your way directly down to the car, approaching it from the west.&lt;br&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_4\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Essential Gear&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;br&gt;These routes are all trad (with a few exceptions).

You can either park on one of the pullouts on the right side of the road, or park in the Storm Mountain picnic ground ($4.00) on the left side of the road. The entrance says that it costs $2 to use the area for any reason, but I\'m not sure if this applies to climbers rather than just picnickers. The host has never said anything as I\'ve walked by, and I\'ve never seen climbers paying fees.  &lt;p&gt;  &lt;b&gt;Static Wall:&lt;/b&gt;  After crossing the bridge, you can see a ridge rising above the trees across from a clearing. This is Reservoir Ridge. You can either approach this ridge and follow the cliff base to Static Wall, or pick your way across the clearing directly to its base.   &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;  &lt;b&gt;Reservoir Alcove:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;From here, walk across a bridge that crosses a stream. To access the Reservoir area, pick your way up some trails that take you to an old concrete barrier that extends out from the reservoir spillway. Follow this wall to the shady base of Reservoir Ridge. I\'m calling the alcove to the right the Reservoir Alcove for lack of a known official name.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;table class=\"inline_image_thumbs\"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=107641\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/107641.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_2\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Area Description&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;br&gt;These are popular climbing areas due to their shady bottoms and proximity to the Storm Mountain picnic ground. Static Wall has steep and physically challenging routes while the Reservoir Alcove has easy sport and trad climbs.  &lt;p&gt;  Another nice thing about climbing here is that if a route is taken, one needs only to walk a couple of minutes to look for free routes on the cliffs across the field to the west or south, such as &lt;a href=\"http://www.summitpost.org/show/route_link.pl/route_id/5580/object_id/4933\"&gt;Storm Mountain Island&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;table border=\"1\" cellspacing=\"0\"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;  &lt;table border=\"0\" cellspacing=\"2\" cellpadding=\"2\"&gt;    &lt;tr bgcolor=\"#c0c0c0\"&gt;&lt;td colspan=\"5\"&gt;&lt;font style=\"font-weight:bold;\"&gt;ROUTES OVERVIEW&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;  &lt;tr&gt;  &lt;td align=\"center\"&gt;&lt;font style=\"font-weight:bold;\"&gt;Route&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/td&gt;  &lt;td align=\"center\"&gt;&lt;font style=\"font-weight:bold;\"&gt;Difficulty&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/td&gt;  &lt;td align=\"center\"&gt;&lt;font style=\"font-weight:bold;\"&gt;Rating&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/td&gt;  &lt;td align=\"center\"&gt;&lt;font style=\"font-weight:bold;\"&gt;FA&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/td&gt;  &lt;td align=\"center\"&gt;&lt;font style=\"font-weight:bold;\"&gt;Trad/Sport&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/td&gt;    &lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;  &lt;td&gt;Storm Mountain Falls&lt;/td&gt;  &lt;td align=\"center\"&gt;Mixed - ??&lt;/td&gt;  &lt;td align=\"center\"&gt;&lt;/td&gt;  &lt;td&gt;Unknown&lt;/td&gt;  &lt;td align=\"center\"&gt;NA&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;    &lt;tr&gt;  &lt;td bgcolor=\"#e0e0e0\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"#one\"&gt;Transformer&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;  &lt;td bgcolor=\"#e0e0e0\" align=\"center\"&gt;5.8&lt;/td&gt;  &lt;td bgcolor=\"#e0e0e0\" align=\"center\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"http://www.summitpost.org/images/stara.gif\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"http://www.summitpost.org/images/stara.gif\"&gt;&lt;/td&gt;  &lt;td bgcolor=\"#e0e0e0\"&gt;1994, Brian Smoot &amp;amp; Sam Carter&lt;/td&gt;  &lt;td bgcolor=\"#e0e0e0\" align=\"center\"&gt;Sp&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;    &lt;tr&gt;  &lt;td&gt;Spinning In The Drain&lt;/td&gt;  &lt;td align=\"center\"&gt;5.13a&lt;/td&gt;  &lt;td align=\"center\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"http://www.summitpost.org/images/stara.gif\"&gt;&lt;/td&gt;  &lt;td&gt;1988, Stuart Ruckman&lt;/td&gt;  &lt;td align=\"center\"&gt;Sp&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;    &lt;tr&gt;  &lt;td bgcolor=\"#e0e0e0\"&gt;All Static And No Dynamic&lt;/td&gt;  &lt;td bgcolor=\"#e0e0e0\" align=\"center\"&gt;5.11d&lt;/td&gt;  &lt;td bgcolor=\"#e0e0e0\" align=\"center\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"http://www.summitpost.org/images/stara.gif\"&gt;&lt;/td&gt;  &lt;td bgcolor=\"#e0e0e0\"&gt;1987, Merrill Bitter&lt;/td&gt;  &lt;td bgcolor=\"#e0e0e0\" align=\"center\"&gt;Sp&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;    &lt;tr&gt;  &lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"#four\"&gt;Reservoir Ridge&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;  &lt;td align=\"center\"&gt;5.4&lt;/td&gt;  &lt;td align=\"center\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"http://www.summitpost.org/images/stara.gif\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"http://www.summitpost.org/images/stara.gif\"&gt;&lt;/td&gt;  &lt;td&gt;Unknown&lt;/td&gt;  &lt;td align=\"center\"&gt;Tr&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;    &lt;tr&gt;  &lt;td bgcolor=\"#e0e0e0\"&gt;Reservoir Wall Left&lt;/td&gt;  &lt;td bgcolor=\"#e0e0e0\" align=\"center\"&gt;5.5?&lt;/td&gt;  &lt;td bgcolor=\"#e0e0e0\" align=\"center\"&gt;&lt;/td&gt;  &lt;td bgcolor=\"#e0e0e0\"&gt;Unknown&lt;/td&gt;  &lt;td bgcolor=\"#e0e0e0\" align=\"center\"&gt;Sp&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;    &lt;td&gt;Reservoir Wall Middle&lt;/td&gt;  &lt;td align=\"center\"&gt;5.5?&lt;/td&gt;  &lt;td align=\"center\"&gt;&lt;/td&gt;  &lt;td&gt;Unknown&lt;/td&gt;  &lt;td align=\"center\"&gt;Sp&lt;/td&gt;    &lt;tr&gt;  &lt;td bgcolor=\"#e0e0e0\"&gt;Reservoir Wall Right&lt;/td&gt;  &lt;td bgcolor=\"#e0e0e0\" align=\"center\"&gt;5.5?&lt;/td&gt;  &lt;td bgcolor=\"#e0e0e0\" align=\"center\"&gt;&lt;/td&gt;  &lt;td bgcolor=\"#e0e0e0\"&gt;Unknown&lt;/td&gt;  &lt;td bgcolor=\"#e0e0e0\" align=\"center\"&gt;Sp&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;    &lt;tr&gt;  &lt;td&gt;Alcove Wall&lt;/td&gt;  &lt;td align=\"center\"&gt;??&lt;/td&gt;  &lt;td align=\"center\"&gt;&lt;/td&gt;  &lt;td&gt;Unknown&lt;/td&gt;  &lt;td align=\"center\"&gt;Sp&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;    &lt;tr&gt;&lt;td colspan=\"5\"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Note: The last four routes are just ones that I have seen, but are not covered in guidebooks.

There are a few overhangs and vertical climbing, but the holds, while slick, are also bomber. This is physical climbing with widely spaced bolts.    &lt;a name=\"four\"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;table class=\"inline_image_thumbs\"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=107640\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/107640.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_4\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Reservoir Ridge - 5.4&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;br&gt;This is a good ridge to practice leading on. In my opinion, its not stellar, but still an interesting route. This route is 3 pitches, but they can be linked into 2 pitches.   &lt;p&gt;  &lt;b&gt;Pitch #1:&lt;/b&gt; (5.4) Begin at the base of the ridge by a fallen log and climb straight up. There aren\'t really any places for pro here, but don\'t despair as there is an occasional bolt. Stay on the west end of the arete and soon some bolted chains are reached. If you have a 60m rope, you can probably clip it and keep climbing, making your belay at the end of Pitch #2.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;  &lt;b&gt;Pitch #2:&lt;/b&gt; (5.4) Bolts become more sparse and you must rely more on pro that you place yourself. At one point a wall is reached. DO NOT traverse around the left side of the wall on an appealing looking ledge. Instead, climb up to the right of it and out onto the Reservoir Wall. Its easier than it looks and placements for pro can be found here. Traverse over and up on the face, and beyond a wide crack and a  large flat ledge there are some chains. Climb just past these to another ledge on the arete and set up your belay here.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;  &lt;b&gt;Pitch #3:&lt;/b&gt; (4th-low 5th) Climb up the remaining spine to the ridge\'s junction with a large wall. Its hard to set up a belay here - I used a combination of scrub and stones.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;  &lt;b&gt;Descent:&lt;/b&gt; Apparently there is a class 3-4 descent to the west. Down-climb cracks and ramps with some exposure. DO NOT descend to the east.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;table class=\"inline_image_thumbs\"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=107639\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/107639.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_5\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Essential Gear&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;br&gt;These routes are mostly sport and as such, only some slings and quickdraws are needed.

The island has some good sport routes offering face climbs, and a collection of moderate crack climbs.  &lt;p&gt;  Another nice thing about climbing here is that if a route is taken, one only needs to walk a couple of minutes to look for free routes on the cliffs across the field to the north, such as &lt;a href=\"http://www.summitpost.org/show/route_link.pl/route_id/5578/object_id/4933\"&gt;Static Wall &amp;amp; Reservoir Alcove&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;  Another thing to consider is the noise from the river below - it can be nearly impossible to communicate with your partner on a climb. 2-way radios would be reccommended to avoid this problem.   &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;

In depth information is from personal experience&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;  &lt;/table&gt;  &lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;  &lt;a name=\"four\"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_3\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Layback Crack - 5.5&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;br&gt;A fun 2.5 pitch climb. To reach it, go left on the pathways beyond the bridge. They end at a picnic table beside the creek. Climb up on some ledges and traverse over to a spot at the base of a dihedral large enough to belay from. The climb starts here. The crack going up the left face of the dihedral is the 5.9 Le Creme De Shorts, which can be top-roped after climbing the first pitch of Layback Crack. If you climb around to the left of the dihedral, this is the high water route for reaching two other good &lt;a href=\"http://www.summitpost.org/mountains/photo_link.pl/p/photo_id__157972__object_id__4933__type__mountain__mountain_id__4933__route_id____user_id____order_by____limit__\"&gt;5.5 climbs&lt;/a&gt; - \'Nice Little Crack\' and \'Storm Mountain Stupor\'.  &lt;p&gt;  Note: This climb is right above the Big Cottonwood Canyon Stream. As such, the noise of the rapids drowns out any communication between climber and belayer. 2-way radios would be recommended for communicating on this climb.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;  &lt;b&gt;Pitch #1:&lt;/b&gt; Climb straight up the dihedral. The crack takes gear well, and the rock forces you to layback on the crack while smearing on the wall. At the top of the dihedral, work your way left.  At the top one needs to do a few mantle moves to reach the belay ledge, which has bolted chains.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;  &lt;b&gt;Pitch #2:&lt;/b&gt; This pitch is easy, but rope drag and runouts are a bit of an issue. While I\'m not sure if this is the proper way, I climbed this pitch by leaving the crack, winding my way to the left of some horns, and then traversing back to the crack beneath a roof, straightening out the rope here. The roof is the first place that takes good pro (some 25 ft above the belay station, via class 3 scrambling). Surmount the rood (5.4), and climb around a large flake, reaching another nice belay ledge with bolted chains on the left.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;  &lt;b&gt;Pitch #2.5:&lt;/b&gt;This pitch is straightforward and only about 20 ft. Just climb up and to the right through a gap (cl. 3-4). Once at the top, you can clamber over some large boulders by some scrub oaks and do a braced body belay between the rocks.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;  &lt;b&gt;Descent:&lt;/b&gt; Walk off to the north west. Follow a climbers trail around the cliffs, looping back to the east, reaching the ampitheater.    &lt;a name=\"eight\"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;table class=\"inline_image_thumbs\"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=107630\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/107630.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_4\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Six Appeal - 5.6&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;br&gt;One of the most popular routes on the island - a straightforward sport route with loads of edging, crimping, and smearing. Best of all, you\'re climbing right beside beautiful Goodro\'s Wall!  &lt;p&gt;  To get to this route, follow the pathways beyond the bridge a little to the left, but soon cut cross country on climbers trails to reach the rock wall. Follow the wall around until you can see &lt;a href=\"http://www.summitpost.org/mountains/photo_link.pl/p/photo_id__157967__object_id__4933__type__mountain__mountain_id__4933__route_id____user_id____order_by____limit__\"&gt;Goodro\'s Wall&lt;/a&gt; (it really stands out). Climb up the short chimney beneath it to reach a large belay ledge and start climbing!  &lt;a name=\"nine\"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;table class=\"inline_image_thumbs\"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=107634\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/107634.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_5\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Epic Wall - 5.5&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;br&gt;This multipitch climb ascends the mossy slabs to the right of Six Appeal. The climb is rather easy, broken, and mossy, but still an allright climb for practicing lead trad.&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Pitch #1:&lt;/b&gt; Climb up the slab, heading toward the outside corner on the right. This bypasses the moss and has the most opportunities for pro. Placements are a little hard to find, but the climbing is easy, with a face climbing crux beneath a roof.  My experience on the route differed slightly from the topo. Instead of climbing to the right of the roof, clip a piton in the roof and traverse around to the left. This brings you to a nice tree with some slings. You can belay from here, or sling it (taking care to flip your rope over the roof!) and keep going.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Pitch #2:&lt;/b&gt; From here the terrain is much more broken, and the climbing is much easier. The route is straightforward, just head straight up and around a large block/spire on the left to the top!&lt;br&gt;&lt;a name=\"ten\"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;table class=\"inline_image_thumbs\"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=107626\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/107626.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_6\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Six Pence - 5.6&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;br&gt;A well protected climb with easy climbing with plenty of edging and smears. There\'s one small crux about 3/4 of the way up, but apart from that, its mostly 5.5. The one downside of this route is the anchor - its not in a very friendly location.  &lt;p&gt;  To reach the route, follow the pathways beyond the bridge a little to the right, but soon cut cross country on climbers trails to reach the rock wall. Follow the trail around until you find a large chimney/chute. The climb ascends the slanted rocky face to the left of this chimney.  &lt;a name=\"twelve\"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;table class=\"inline_image_thumbs\"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=107637\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/107637.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_7\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The Flake - 5.5&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;br&gt;At the amphitheater, head towards a pine tree on the left side, behind the seats. This climb ascends the chimney behind this tree.  &lt;p&gt;  The first pitch is fun, although a littel anti-climatic as you really don\'t have to climb over an imposing roof via a crack. The belay ledges above are filled with scree, which is well position to pelt your belayer with rocks as your rope knocks bits off. The final pitch makes this route, with steep and exposed climbing up a crack an on an arete. Pro is more difficult to place on the upper pitch,  and the conclusion of the pitch is an exposed mantle if you refrain from clipping the anchor bolts of Padded Cell.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;  &lt;b&gt;Pitch #1:&lt;/b&gt; Climb up a crack (5.5), and then zig back to broken rock on your right, and zag forward to bypass the roof to reach the belay ledges. The higher ledge seems a bit nicer, and you\'re better positioned for the next pitch. If you traverse out from here, you will reach the start of Padded Cell (5.12a or 5.12c)  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;  &lt;b&gt;Pitch #2:&lt;/b&gt; Ascend up and right into a narrow chimney/crack (5.5), where you must either use moves on the face or jambs in the crack. The rock is clean and smooth, and a little difficult to protect. This pitch takes you out from the \'protection\' of the rock walls, allowing you to feel the full exposure of the upper pitch. Near the top is a large, flat ledge (its hard to miss). If you walk out on this block, you can clip the Padded Cell anchors, and then double-back to the arete for the final mantle move (5.5).  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;  &lt;b&gt;Descent:&lt;/b&gt; Scramble south and then circle back around (west-north-east) to the amphitheater via a climbers trail.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;table class=\"inline_image_thumbs\"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=113705\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/113705.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_8\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Essential Gear&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;br&gt;For sport routes, some slings and 6 or 7 quickdraws is plenty. For the multipitch, a full rack of pro can be useful, as a variety of sizes and techniques are needed.&lt;br&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_9\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Other Info&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;br&gt;If you have additional info for routes described or have done a route not described in depth, please put the info here and I\'ll integrate it into the page!&lt;br&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_10\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Images&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div align=\"center\"&gt;&lt;table id=\"my_images\"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/may-26th-2005-layback/107630/c-165308\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"May 26th, 2005 - Layback...\" src=\"/images/square/107630.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/may-26th-2005-the-famous/107629/c-165308\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"May 26th, 2005 - The famous...\" src=\"/images/square/107629.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/2002-peter-golden-leading/107634/c-165308\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"2002 - Peter Golden leading...\" src=\"/images/square/107634.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/may-26th-2005-another/107637/c-165308\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"May 26th, 2005 - Another...\" src=\"/images/square/107637.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/may-26th-2005-the-famous/107628/c-165308\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"May 26th, 2005 - The famous...\" src=\"/images/square/107628.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/may-26th-2005-two-other/107632/c-165308\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"May 26th, 2005 - Two other...\" src=\"/images/square/107632.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/may-26th-2005-one-of-the/107626/c-165308\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"May 26th, 2005 - One of the...\" src=\"/images/square/107626.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/may-26th-2005-the-flake/113705/c-165308\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"May 26th, 2005 - The Flake...\" src=\"/images/square/113705.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/article&gt;date:'),(289,165324,'/dead-snag/165324','/big-cottonwood-canyon/154148','Dead Snag','','','5.5-5.10a','','',4345,40.6194,-111.787,'Utah, United States, North America','','',154148,'Big Cottonwood Canyon','','0.8','Trad - Single/Multiptich','','Less than two hours','Route','content: &lt;article&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_1\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2 id=\"first_h2\"&gt;Approach&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;br&gt;Park 2.7 miles up the canyon from the neon sign.

Cross the stream and pick your way over to the wall.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;  &lt;b&gt;Alternative Approach:&lt;/b&gt; Some people park in the last pullout before the one mentioned above, and scramble up a small creekbed directly to the base of the wall.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;  &lt;b&gt;Descents:&lt;/b&gt; From the top of the routes, follow a ledge system south. At a grove of trees are rap anchors. You can descend from here via 2 80\' and a 60\' rapp, or continue along the class 3 ledge system to a single 60\' rapp.&lt;br&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_2\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Route Description&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;br&gt;Topo photo coming soon to a route page near you . . .  &lt;p&gt;  Dead Snag is a large east facing wall of quartzite near the mouth of Stairs Gulch. It offers a variety of moderate grade trad multi-pitch routes, which ascend clean crack systems. Still, since the rock is quartzite, face climbing using square holds predominates.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;table border=\"1\" cellspacing=\"0\"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;  &lt;table border=\"0\" cellspacing=\"2\" cellpadding=\"2\"&gt;    &lt;tr bgcolor=\"#c0c0c0\"&gt;&lt;td colspan=\"5\"&gt;&lt;font style=\"font-weight:bold;\"&gt;ROUTES OVERVIEW&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;  &lt;tr&gt;  &lt;td align=\"center\"&gt;&lt;font style=\"font-weight:bold;\"&gt;Route&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/td&gt;  &lt;td align=\"center\"&gt;&lt;font style=\"font-weight:bold;\"&gt;Difficulty&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/td&gt;  &lt;td align=\"center\"&gt;&lt;font style=\"font-weight:bold;\"&gt;Rating&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/td&gt;  &lt;td align=\"center\"&gt;&lt;font style=\"font-weight:bold;\"&gt;FA&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/td&gt;  &lt;td align=\"center\"&gt;&lt;font style=\"font-weight:bold;\"&gt;Trad/Sport&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/td&gt;    &lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;  &lt;td&gt;Tiger\'s Den  &lt;/td&gt;&lt;td align=\"center\"&gt;5.8?&lt;/td&gt;  &lt;td align=\"center\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"http://www.summitpost.org/images/stara.gif\"&gt;&lt;/td&gt;  &lt;td&gt;Unknown&lt;/td&gt;  &lt;td align=\"center\"&gt;Tr&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;    &lt;tr&gt;  &lt;td bgcolor=\"#e0e0e0\"&gt;East Dihedrals&lt;/td&gt;  &lt;td bgcolor=\"#e0e0e0\" align=\"center\"&gt;5.6&lt;/td&gt;  &lt;td bgcolor=\"#e0e0e0\" align=\"center\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"http://www.summitpost.org/images/stara.gif\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"http://www.summitpost.org/images/stara.gif\"&gt;&lt;/td&gt;  &lt;td bgcolor=\"#e0e0e0\"&gt;Unknown&lt;/td&gt;  &lt;td bgcolor=\"#e0e0e0\" align=\"center\"&gt;Tr&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;    &lt;tr&gt;  &lt;td&gt;Jig\'s Up&lt;/td&gt;  &lt;td align=\"center\"&gt;5.6&lt;/td&gt;  &lt;td align=\"center\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"http://www.summitpost.org/images/stara.gif\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"http://www.summitpost.org/images/stara.gif\"&gt;&lt;/td&gt;  &lt;td&gt;1961, Ted Wilson &amp;amp; Milt Hokanson&lt;/td&gt;  &lt;td align=\"center\"&gt;Tr&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;    &lt;tr&gt;  &lt;td bgcolor=\"#e0e0e0\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"#four\"&gt;Steort\'s Ridge&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;  &lt;td bgcolor=\"#e0e0e0\" align=\"center\"&gt;5.6&lt;/td&gt;  &lt;td bgcolor=\"#e0e0e0\" align=\"center\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"http://www.summitpost.org/images/stara.gif\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"http://www.summitpost.org/images/stara.gif\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"http://www.summitpost.org/images/stara.gif\"&gt;&lt;/td&gt;  &lt;td bgcolor=\"#e0e0e0\"&gt;late 40s, Lee Steorts &amp;amp; Harold Goodro&lt;/td&gt;  &lt;td bgcolor=\"#e0e0e0\" align=\"center\"&gt;Tr&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;    &lt;tr&gt;  &lt;td&gt;North Dihedrals&lt;/td&gt;  &lt;td align=\"center\"&gt;5.6&lt;/td&gt;  &lt;td align=\"center\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"http://www.summitpost.org/images/stara.gif\"&gt;&lt;/td&gt;  &lt;td&gt;Unknown&lt;/td&gt;  &lt;td align=\"center\"&gt;Tr&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;    &lt;tr&gt;  &lt;td bgcolor=\"#e0e0e0\"&gt;Ad Lib&lt;/td&gt;  &lt;td bgcolor=\"#e0e0e0\" align=\"center\"&gt;5.10a&lt;/td&gt;  &lt;td bgcolor=\"#e0e0e0\" align=\"center\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"http://www.summitpost.org/images/stara.gif\"&gt;&lt;/td&gt;  &lt;td bgcolor=\"#e0e0e0\"&gt;1986, Stuart Ruckman &amp;amp; Libby Ellis&lt;/td&gt;  &lt;td bgcolor=\"#e0e0e0\" align=\"center\"&gt;Tr&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;    &lt;tr&gt;  &lt;td&gt;North Ridge&lt;/td&gt;  &lt;td align=\"center\"&gt;5.5&lt;/td&gt;  &lt;td align=\"center\"&gt;&lt;/td&gt;  &lt;td&gt;Unknown&lt;/td&gt;  &lt;td align=\"center\"&gt;Tr&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;    &lt;tr&gt;&lt;td colspan=\"5\"&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;i&gt;Route overview information used from Stuart &amp;amp; Bret Ruckman\'s &lt;a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0762727306/summitpost-20/103-3515982-7251006\"&gt;Rock Climbing the Wasatch Range&lt;/a&gt;.

This is about 30 ft left from the point where the wall changes from east-facing to north-facing.  &lt;p&gt;  &lt;b&gt;Pitch #1:&lt;/b&gt; Head up just left of the arete and climb over a roof (5.6). Stay near the arete and a belay ledge is reached beneath another roof.

Another belay ledge directly on the arete is reached after bypassing a smooth slab to the left.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;  &lt;b&gt;Pitch #3:&lt;/b&gt; This last pitch climbs right on the arete straight to the top. Part of the pitch is runout, with a lone bolt in the middle of some smooth quartzite climbing for protection.

The largest and highest of these is the southernmost one, which is climbed via the main trail, and the 5 northern summit pinnacles can be &lt;a href=\"http://www.summitpost.org/show/route_link.pl/route_id/4488/object_id/1396\"&gt;bypassed&lt;/a&gt; to the west. But all of the summits can be climbed while staying fairly true to the ridge crest linking them.  That is this route.&lt;br&gt;&lt;a name=\"goddess\"&gt;&lt;br&gt;As far as I can determine by looking in guidebooks and asking around at the local climbing shops, these summits don\'t have official names. I felt giving them names would make them more interesting than merely referring to them as North Summit #1, #2, etc.  In Andrew McLean\'s extreme skiing guide, &lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0962193577/qid=1118083833/sr=8-1/ref=sr_8_xs_ap_i1_xgl14/102-8978518-8291349?v=glance&amp;amp;s=books&amp;amp;n=507846\"&gt;Chuting Gallery&lt;/a&gt;, the couloirs are named after some of the male Greek gods, in keeping with the \'mountain of the gods\' theme for Mount Olympus. I\'m following that spirit by referring to the summits by the names of the female goddesses of Mt Olympus (there just happens to be 6 goddesses and 6 summits!).  They are as follows:&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;font color=\"blue\"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Athena&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt; - Northermost summit &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;font color=\"blue\"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Artemis&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt; - Highest of the northern summits group. The summit block is shaped like a diamond. The block is a good place to wave to tourists on the main summit. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;font color=\"blue\"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Aphrodite&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt; - The next north summit aftter Artemis. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; &lt;font color=\"blue\"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Demeter&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt; - The next summit after Aphrodite. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;font color=\"blue\"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Hestia&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt; - the southermost of the northern summits. You look down on its south face from the main summit. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;font color=\"blue\"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Hera&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt; - Zeus\'s wife, head Goddess, and the largest and highest of all of Mt Olympus\' summits. The main trail ascends the south side of the summit.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;br&gt;The route bags all 5 summits, and it is characterized by solid rock and airy exposure, but the route is more like exposed class 3-4 scrambling with an occasional 5th class boulder move. It is also fairly non-committing as you can descend the chutes to the west down to the &lt;a href=\"http://www.summitpost.org/show/route_link.pl/route_id/4488/object_id/1396\"&gt;North Summits Bypass&lt;/a&gt; route. This can be done between Athena and Artemis, down the summit ridge of Artemis, and &lt;i&gt;possibly&lt;/i&gt; between Artemis &amp;amp; Aphrodite, and Aphrodite &amp;amp; Demeter.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://www.summitpost.org/mountains/photo_link.pl?photo_id=139918&amp;amp;object_id=1396&amp;amp;type=mountain&amp;amp;mountain_id=1396&amp;amp;route_id=4488\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"http://www.summitpost.org/images/original/94071.jpg\" width=\"80%\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_2\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Approach&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;br&gt;Begin from the Mount Olympus Trailhead or the \'Cove\' suburb north of the mountain and climb either the &lt;a href=\"http://www.summitpost.org/show/route_link.pl/route_id/1055/object_id/1396\"&gt;Mount Olympus Trail&lt;/a&gt; to Hera (the main summit), or climb Athena (the northernmost summit) via the &lt;a href=\"http://www.summitpost.org/show/route_link.pl/route_id/4489/object_id/1396\"&gt;West Ridge&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"http://www.summitpost.org/show/route_link.pl/route_id/1517/object_id/1396\"&gt;North Face Trail&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href=\"http://www.summitpost.org/show/route_link.pl/route_id/1528/object_id/1396\"&gt;West Slabs&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The route goes from the summit of Athena to the summit of Hera.&lt;br&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_3\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Route Description&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;br&gt;This route will be described heading from Athena to Hera, as this is the easiest direction to do it in.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;From Athena, descend down to the saddle and climb the northern wall of Artemis via a &lt;a href=\"http://www.summitpost.org/mountains/photo_link.pl?photo_id=159420&amp;amp;object_id=1396&amp;amp;type=mountain&amp;amp;mountain_id=1396&amp;amp;route_id=\"&gt;class 4 chimney&lt;/a&gt;. From the top of this, traverse around the south side of the ridge to gain the diamond-shaped summit (cl 3).  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;From Artemis, scramble directly south and slightly west to an &lt;a href=\"http://www.summitpost.org/mountains/photo_link.pl?photo_id=159422&amp;amp;object_id=1396&amp;amp;type=mountain&amp;amp;mountain_id=1396&amp;amp;route_id=\"&gt;off-width chimney&lt;/a&gt; (cl. 4) squeeze/lower yourself down this, and downclimb (cl. 3) to a saddle. The next summit is Aphrodite, which can be climbed by two variations. Traverse along a ledge on the west side of the summit rib.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Variation 1:&lt;/b&gt; As you reach the rib, climb an exposed crack (cl. 4 to low 5th) to the airy ridge above the ledge. From here scramble to the summit (cl. 3). Then do a class 3 downclimb to the next saddle south.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Variaton 2:&lt;/b&gt; Traverse around to the south side of the summit. From here a &lt;a href=\"http://www.summitpost.org/mountains/photo_link.pl?photo_id=159423&amp;amp;object_id=1396&amp;amp;type=mountain&amp;amp;mountain_id=1396&amp;amp;route_id=\"&gt;sidewalk-width ledge&lt;/a&gt; takes you out onto the south face, with a 40 or 50 ft drop below. At one point you must step across a gap while reaching across for handholds, which is a dicey, but secure, move.  Shortly beyond this the prominent ledge is &lt;a href=\"http://www.summitpost.org/mountains/photo_link.pl?photo_id=159426&amp;amp;object_id=1396&amp;amp;type=mountain&amp;amp;mountain_id=1396&amp;amp;route_id=\"&gt;absorbed into the wall&lt;/a&gt;, but you can keep traversing on a steeply sloped ledge, using solid holds and edging (low 5th), and eventually the saddle between Aphrodite and Demeter is reached. It is then a class 3 scramble to the summit of Aphrodite.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The north side of Demeter looks as impassable as that of Aphrodite, but upon closer inspection a large crack just to the left of the saddle provides solid climbing (cl. 4) with good and easy to find holds.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;From Demeter, traverse along the east side of a rocky spur (cl. 2-3) to the next saddle, and climb the low rise to the summit of Hestia. From here you have an unobstructed view of the highest summit of Mt Olympus, Hera. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Next to Hestia\'s summit are some rap slings. You can either rap from here (lazy), downclimb on belay and then belay the second throught he rap slings from below (safe), or just free-solo climb down a &lt;a href=\"http://www.summitpost.org/mountains/photo_link.pl?photo_id=159432&amp;amp;object_id=1396&amp;amp;type=mountain&amp;amp;mountain_id=1396&amp;amp;route_id=\"&gt;broken face&lt;/a&gt;, staying along a broken crack (cl. 3-4). Soon you reach a large ledge of smooth quartzite with more rap slings. You can rap off the overhanging roofs directly south if you wish (I imagine that there are more rapps needed after this, with slings in place, but I didn\'t go this way)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;An alternative is to follow ledges to the west, downclimbing to the south where it looks feasible. One crux reached is a steep chimney with a prominent ridge (low 5th). Beyond this, scramble down and around a large overhanging wall. At the base of it you can see the downclimb is almost over, but the &lt;a href=\"http://www.summitpost.org/mountains/photo_link.pl?photo_id=159429&amp;amp;object_id=1396&amp;amp;type=mountain&amp;amp;mountain_id=1396&amp;amp;route_id=\"&gt;crux&lt;/a&gt; of the entire route is next.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As you downclimb south, a dropoff is reached. Luckily, there are good solid holds at the top of the dropoff. Grip these and carefully lower yourself over the overhanging roof (5.6) ! If you stretch your arms as far as you can you may just barely be able to put your feet on the ground (depending on body height). You can also drop the last bit, or make use of the footholds on the underside of the roof to counterthrust as you work your hands down to lower handholds (which is more in tune with the motions you would probably need to climb &lt;i&gt;up&lt;/i&gt; the overhang. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Once past the overhang, scramble down a class 3 crack. For those climbing the route in reverse, the downclimb exits between the south face of Hestia and a truck-sized boulder perched on a ledge to the west.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;From here walk along the large saddle toward Hera. A large chute ascends directly from here. Climb up this &lt;a href=\"http://www.summitpost.org/mountains/photo_link.pl?photo_id=159427&amp;amp;object_id=1396&amp;amp;type=mountain&amp;amp;mountain_id=1396&amp;amp;route_id=\"&gt;chute&lt;/a&gt;, which is filled with snow until late in the year. At the top, work your way east (left) along easy class 3 ledges to the summit ridge. From here it is a class 2 boulder-hop to the summit. An alternative is to climb the broken face to the left of the chute (cl. 3-4). &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If you\'re descending the main trail, read the &lt;a href=\"http://www.summitpost.org/show/route_link.pl/route_id/1055/object_id/1396\"&gt;Mount Olympus Trail&lt;/a&gt; route page.&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;table class=\"inline_image_thumbs\"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=108748\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/108748.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=108758\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/108758.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=108751\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/108751.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=108754\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/108754.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=108756\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/108756.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_4\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Essential Gear&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;br&gt;A rope and a light rack might be useful if you want to protect sections, although the exposed sections are short.

You can either park on one of the pullouts on the right side of the road, or park in the Storm Mountain picnic ground ($4.00) on the left side of the road. The entrance says that it costs $2 to use the area for any reason, but I\'m not sure if this applies to climbers rather than just picnickers. The host has never said anything as I\'ve walked by, and I\'ve never seen climbers paying fees.   &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;  Once in the picnic ground, cross the bridge and follow the asphalt paths to the right to reach a playground at the edge of a large field. Follow a climbers trail throught the grasses across the field to the wall, which is NW from the playground. Enter the trees and scramble up a ledge system angling left (cl. 4) to reach the base of the main wall.    &lt;br&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_2\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Route Description&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;br&gt;This wall provides opportunities for some long single-pitch top-roping and some long 2-pitch trad climbs. The wall is deceptively difficult and provides steep climbing, generally following the rock strata diagonally to the left. The main wall has bomber &amp;amp; clean rock, but the rock quality reportedly varies from route to route.  &lt;p&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;table border=\"1\" cellspacing=\"0\"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;  &lt;table border=\"0\" cellspacing=\"2\" cellpadding=\"2\"&gt;    &lt;tr bgcolor=\"#c0c0c0\"&gt;&lt;td colspan=\"5\"&gt;&lt;font style=\"font-weight:bold;\"&gt;ROUTES OVERVIEW&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;  &lt;tr&gt;  &lt;td align=\"center\"&gt;&lt;font style=\"font-weight:bold;\"&gt;Route&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/td&gt;  &lt;td align=\"center\"&gt;&lt;font style=\"font-weight:bold;\"&gt;Difficulty&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/td&gt;  &lt;td align=\"center\"&gt;&lt;font style=\"font-weight:bold;\"&gt;Rating&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/td&gt;  &lt;td align=\"center\"&gt;&lt;font style=\"font-weight:bold;\"&gt;FA&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/td&gt;  &lt;td align=\"center\"&gt;&lt;font style=\"font-weight:bold;\"&gt;Trad/Sport&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/td&gt;    &lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;  &lt;td&gt;Trick of the Light&lt;/td&gt;  &lt;td align=\"center\"&gt;5.11d&lt;/td&gt;  &lt;td align=\"center\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"http://www.summitpost.org/images/stara.gif\"&gt;&lt;/td&gt;  &lt;td&gt;1987, Paul Lanz&lt;/td&gt;  &lt;td align=\"center\"&gt;Sp&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;    &lt;tr&gt;  &lt;td bgcolor=\"#e0e0e0\"&gt;Winter in Waimea&lt;/td&gt;  &lt;td bgcolor=\"#e0e0e0\" align=\"center\"&gt;5.11d&lt;/td&gt;  &lt;td bgcolor=\"#e0e0e0\" align=\"center\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"http://www.summitpost.org/images/stara.gif\"&gt;&lt;/td&gt;  &lt;td bgcolor=\"#e0e0e0\"&gt;1987, Paul Lanz&lt;/td&gt;  &lt;td bgcolor=\"#e0e0e0\" align=\"center\"&gt;Sp&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;    &lt;tr&gt;  &lt;td&gt;Mercy Street&lt;/td&gt;  &lt;td align=\"center\"&gt;5.7+&lt;/td&gt;  &lt;td align=\"center\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"http://www.summitpost.org/images/stara.gif\"&gt;&lt;/td&gt;  &lt;td&gt;Unknown&lt;/td&gt;  &lt;td align=\"center\"&gt;Tr&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;    &lt;tr&gt;  &lt;td bgcolor=\"#e0e0e0\"&gt;Merci-Buckets&lt;/td&gt;  &lt;td bgcolor=\"#e0e0e0\" align=\"center\"&gt;5.11b&lt;/td&gt;  &lt;td bgcolor=\"#e0e0e0\" align=\"center\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"http://www.summitpost.org/images/stara.gif\"&gt;&lt;/td&gt;  &lt;td bgcolor=\"#e0e0e0\"&gt;1990, Stuart &amp;amp; Bret Ruckman&lt;/td&gt;  &lt;td bgcolor=\"#e0e0e0\" align=\"center\"&gt;Sp&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;    &lt;tr&gt;  &lt;td&gt;Charlie\'s Traverse&lt;/td&gt;  &lt;td align=\"center\"&gt;5.6&lt;/td&gt;  &lt;td align=\"center\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"http://www.summitpost.org/images/stara.gif\"&gt;&lt;/td&gt;  &lt;td&gt;early 60s, Dick Bell, Ben Peterson &amp;amp; John Paup&lt;/td&gt;  &lt;td align=\"center\"&gt;Tr&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;    &lt;tr&gt;  &lt;td bgcolor=\"#e0e0e0\"&gt;Mercy Me&lt;/td&gt;  &lt;td bgcolor=\"#e0e0e0\" align=\"center\"&gt;5.9&lt;/td&gt;  &lt;td bgcolor=\"#e0e0e0\" align=\"center\"&gt;&lt;/td&gt;  &lt;td bgcolor=\"#e0e0e0\"&gt;Unknown&lt;/td&gt;  &lt;td bgcolor=\"#e0e0e0\" align=\"center\"&gt;Tr&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;    &lt;tr&gt;  &lt;td&gt;Upchuck&lt;/td&gt;  &lt;td align=\"center\"&gt;5.10a&lt;/td&gt;  &lt;td align=\"center\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"http://www.summitpost.org/images/stara.gif\"&gt;&lt;/td&gt;  &lt;td&gt;Unknown&lt;/td&gt;  &lt;td align=\"center\"&gt;Tr&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;    &lt;tr&gt;  &lt;td bgcolor=\"#e0e0e0\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"#eight\"&gt;Fowl Play&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;  &lt;td bgcolor=\"#e0e0e0\" align=\"center\"&gt;5.9+&lt;/td&gt;  &lt;td bgcolor=\"#e0e0e0\" align=\"center\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"http://www.summitpost.org/images/stara.gif\"&gt;&lt;/td&gt;  &lt;td bgcolor=\"#e0e0e0\"&gt;1995, Brian Smoot &amp;amp; Glen Henshaw&lt;/td&gt;  &lt;td bgcolor=\"#e0e0e0\" align=\"center\"&gt;Sp&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;    &lt;tr&gt;  &lt;td&gt;Check Point Charlie&lt;/td&gt;  &lt;td align=\"center\"&gt;5.9+&lt;/td&gt;  &lt;td align=\"center\"&gt;&lt;/td&gt;  &lt;td&gt;Unknown&lt;/td&gt;  &lt;td align=\"center\"&gt;Tr&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;    &lt;tr&gt;  &lt;td bgcolor=\"#e0e0e0\"&gt;The Bee Pitch&lt;/td&gt;  &lt;td bgcolor=\"#e0e0e0\" align=\"center\"&gt;5.8&lt;/td&gt;  &lt;td bgcolor=\"#e0e0e0\" align=\"center\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"http://www.summitpost.org/images/stara.gif\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"http://www.summitpost.org/images/stara.gif\"&gt;&lt;/td&gt;  &lt;td bgcolor=\"#e0e0e0\"&gt;1961, Dave Wood &amp;amp; Bob Irvine&lt;/td&gt;  &lt;td bgcolor=\"#e0e0e0\" align=\"center\"&gt;Tr&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;    &lt;tr&gt;  &lt;td&gt;Sin Nombre&lt;/td&gt;  &lt;td align=\"center\"&gt;5.9+&lt;/td&gt;  &lt;td align=\"center\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"http://www.summitpost.org/images/stara.gif\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"http://www.summitpost.org/images/stara.gif\"&gt;&lt;/td&gt;  &lt;td&gt;Unknown&lt;/td&gt;  &lt;td align=\"center\"&gt;Tr&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;    &lt;tr&gt;  &lt;td bgcolor=\"#e0e0e0\"&gt;Rotten Roost&lt;/td&gt;  &lt;td bgcolor=\"#e0e0e0\" align=\"center\"&gt;5.8?

It begins from where you reach the large ledge, and gradually works left. This route is well protected by closely spaced bolts.  &lt;p&gt;  There are two cruxes, the hardest being at the 2nd bolt where one must climb over a vertical smooth wall with jugs at the top (5.9+?). You can rest on a narrow ledge at the top of this. If you want to cheat, you can climb around the left edge of the slab (5.8?). The top third of the route is much easier. From the anchor chains, it is a vertical 80 ft rap.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;  The upper part of the route introduces enough rope drag that if top-roping the route, the belayer may want to stand up, take in rope, and sit down to make sure that all the slack is taken in.&lt;br&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_4\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Essential Gear&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;br&gt;I\'ve only climbed on a sport route, where your standard rack of quickdraws &amp;amp; some runners for the anchor are fine. I don\'t know what would be needed for the trad routes. While helmets are usually a good idea, the rock here is solid and pretty well cleaned out.&lt;br&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_5\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Other Info&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;br&gt;If you have additional info for routes described or have done a route not described in depth, please put the info here and I\'ll integrate it into the page!&lt;br&gt;&lt;/article&gt;date:'),(292,165728,'/narcolepsy-area/165728','/big-cottonwood-canyon/154148','Narcolepsy Area','','','5.8 - 5.11a','','',4799,40.6194,-111.787,'Utah, United States, North America','','',154148,'Big Cottonwood Canyon','','1.0','Sport,Trad - Single Pitch','','Less than two hours','Route','content: &lt;article&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_1\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2 id=\"first_h2\"&gt;Approach&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;br&gt;Park at the turnouts 2.4 miles up the canyon from the neon sign or the Park N\' Ride. The turnouts are just past JHCOB wall on the south side of the road.  &lt;p&gt;  If you look at the cliffs high above the scree slopes, you can pick out a large rock wall with a red oxidized stain on it - this is the Narcolepsy Area. A rough climbers trail heads into a grove of pine trees from the turnout.    &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;  While some may disagree, due to dead-fall and the VERY loose rock at the end of the climber\'s trail that stays in the trees, I\'d recommend  following the climbers trail that turns out from the grove of pines (heading east) and ascends the scree slope directly. This is still loose, and has a longer stretch of loose rock, but for me it still seemed to be less of a pain.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;  If you stay on the climbers trail, eventually it reaches the end of the pine grove and heads uphill, traversing along the base of the Narcolepsy area.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;  From here, there is a rock outcropping, with two prominent cracks splitting one large wall. This is the bottom of the Narcolepsy area, but most of the routes are found along the higher, shady, 100 ft wide wall. Just walk around the east (up canyon) side of the rock outcrops to reach the flat shady areas at the base of the wall.   &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;  Overall, one ascends some 150 ft over loose rock to reach the wall,  which should take about 5-10 minutes.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;table class=\"inline_image_thumbs\"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=113714\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/113714.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=113715\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/113715.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=113720\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/113720.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_2\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Route Description&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;br&gt;Narcolepsy Wall is a great climbing area just a short ways above the loose slopes south of the Big Cottonwood Canyon road, just downhill from the Storm Mountain Picnic Ground. It is mostly hidden by pines, so it is hard to see from the road, but these pines keep the wall shady for most of the day.  &lt;p&gt;  The wall is vertical or slightly less than vertical and sports a number of quality face and crack climbs, all of which can be top-roped if desired. The rock is solid and clean, and the relative isolation of this crag keeps many of the evening crowds away.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;table border=\"1\" cellspacing=\"0\"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;

A gear anchor can be made here, and there is a SLCD left in one of the cracks.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;  To set up anchors for the rest of the routes, follow a climber trail up and around to the left of the wall.This eventually doubles back on a ledge, which takes you to a large, sloping ledge atop the wall. It has some loose flakey rock, but it is easy to scramble down to reach the anchors.   &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;  The top of Narcosis is easy to locate because of the large chock-stone at the top. Walk around the left of this to reach a 5 ft wide ledge. From here there are bolts on the end that can be used for Suture Fancy and Involuntary Release. If you reach over the edge of the ledge, you can reach the bolts atop Dreamscape. The bolt anchors for Narcosis are inconveniently far below the ledge, and one should probably clip a sling into the bolts for Involuntary Release before downclimbing to these bolts. It is easier to downclimb partway down the arete and reach back over to the chains.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;  For the routes further to the right of Suture Fancy, the scrambling to reach the anchors is exposed and a fall could be fatal. This is especially the case for the bolts above Dream Slate.  To minimize the hazard, the anchor setter can downclimb to these from the ledge atop Dreamscape Wall while on belay from the bolts on this ledge. I found it awkward to throw the rope down from these anchors and still return to the ledge atop Dreamscape Wall while on belay. DO NOT climb back up and throw the ropes from Dreamscape Wall - there are two large horns jutting out near the bolted anchors for Dream Slate that &lt;i&gt;will&lt;/i&gt; snag your rope! Perhaps the best way to top rope these routes is to have two ropes, one to descend to the anchors on, and another to thread through the anchor and throw off.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;  Any route that ends on the main wall can be walked off via the way described for reaching the anchors.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_4\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Narcosis - 5.8&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;br&gt;This is the large chimney between Dreamscape Wall and the Prow. It starts out as an easy crack climb (5.5), with a break in the middle before the chimney, topping out after 60 ft of climbing.    &lt;p&gt;  The chimney was fun, fast, and easy climbing, but I was a little disappointed - I had been expecting a more difficult squeeze chimney, but in fact, when the chimney gets tight, one merely needs to climb near the ouside edges and there face climbing moves allow you to bypass the more difficult chimney moves.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;  I didn\'t really see any places where pro can be placed in the chimney, although I wasn\'t looking terribly hard for placements as I was on top rope.   &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;  If top-roping this route, the anchor possibilities at the top are lousy (I slung two small horns, a bunch of bushes, and had a small nut in a crack directly more to the side than along the direction of pull) and the rope drag is high. The best option is to belay from above. Here you can do a braced belay  behind a ledge a little below the top of the route, and sling yourself to a small tree for added security. The rope drag is minimal belaying from above. Also, the top has long, narrow cracks that will eat the rope - it is recommended that you place a scured backpack or rope bag across this gap to keep the rope out of it!  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;  &lt;b&gt;Descent:&lt;/b&gt; Lower or walk off (walk off is probably more pleasant)  &lt;br&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_5\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Dreamscape - 5.9+&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;br&gt;This route was really fun. The wall started steep with juggy holds, but as one climbs higher, a featureless bulge is approached. Climb to the left of this and traverse back over higher up on fingertip holds.  &lt;p&gt;  At the top of the bulge one must mantle a 2-6 inch wide flake, as there are no holds above it, and then tip-toe along the flake before the final climb to the top.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;  This wall is steep, the rock is bomber, and the bolts are widely spaced along this 60 ft route. The route ascends Dreamscape Wall, which stays shaded throughout the entire day. The bolted anchors can easily be reached from the large ledge above the wall (see &lt;i&gt;Anchors and Walk Offs&lt;/i&gt; for details).  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;  &lt;b&gt;Descent:&lt;/b&gt; Lower or walk off  &lt;br&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_6\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Narcolepsy - 5.8 R&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;br&gt;This is a really fun sport climb ascending the right side of Dreamscape Wall near the arete. Climb up the steep rock - as it gets steeper hold disapper. Watch out for a loose flake. When upward progress becomes too difficult, step over to the arete and climb up it, occasionally working back onto the wall.  &lt;p&gt;  &lt;b&gt;Descent:&lt;/b&gt; Lower or walk off&lt;br&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_7\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Involuntary Release - 5.10a&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;br&gt;Involuntary Release ascends the first crack to the right of the Dreamscape Wall arete.  &lt;p&gt;  This is a great route requiring a mixture of crack and face climbing. The climb begins with a 20 ft finger crack, which is conducive to laybacking. This crack dead-ends into a roof, which is bypassed to the left by reaching across polished quartzite, laybacking on the arete of Dreamscape Wall, and then traversing back to the continuation of the crack above the roof on smooth squared finger-holds.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;  About 10 ft before the top a large ledge is reached. The final wall is a fun 5.9-5.10? climb, although it looks difficult to protect, so lead climbers beware falling onto the ledge!  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;  This route can be top-roped a bolted anchor on top of a wide ledge above Dreamscape Wall (see &lt;i&gt;Anchors and Walk Offs&lt;/i&gt; for details).  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;  This route has thin cracks, so micro-nuts are key to protection on lead.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;  &lt;b&gt;Descent:&lt;/b&gt; Lower or walk off  &lt;br&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_8\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Suture Fancy - 5.8-5.9&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;br&gt;Suture Fancy ascends the next crack to the right of Involuntary Release.  &lt;p&gt;  This route is fun and interesting, although it is also a little dirty and brushy. To be frank, I found the route and its rating confusing, which I will discuss below.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;  The route starts with a nice crack climb, but is interrupted by some unpleasant brush in the crack midway up. The &lt;i&gt;Rock Climbing the Wasatch Range&lt;/i&gt;\'s topo shows this section as being 5.9, but I\'d say it is more like 5.7 to 5.8.  The crack turns into a notch cutting through a roof, and this is where the confusion begins.   &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;  The notch itself looks unpleasant, being small enough to get a climber stuck. You can ascend some smaller cracks a couple of feet to the left over the roof (5.9), or you can climb out of the notch onto an overhanging face (5.8) a couple of feet to the right. As the routes on either side of this one are 5.10a, neither variation could be ascending an easier route, so I can only assume that either one is \'legal\' for staying on route.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;  Above the roof is a large ledge covered in talus with a bit of brush. The route topo shows the route ascending this ledge to the right, with a little more climbing before reaching the top (which is very easy and burshy), where a gear anchor can be made or you can clip into the chains for Dream Slate.  I top-roped this route from the bolts for Involuntary Release, and it is nicer and more direct to climb to the left, reaching the large ledge and final 5.9-5.10? headwall below the bolted anchors.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;  &lt;b&gt;Descent:&lt;/b&gt; Lower or walk off&lt;br&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_9\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Turn of the Sentry - 5.8&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;br&gt;This is the rightmost route on the north west wall of the Narcolepsy Area. Ascend wide cracks between the wall and some large, disconnected blocks. Climb along a large crack, with some face climbing moves. It is helpful to shove your leg in the crack for climbing. At the top of the crack, traverse to the right to a pair of finger cracks. Ascend these up a smooth face to a ledge. From here climb around the backside of a wall to your left to reach the sloping rock ramps where you can make a gear anchor. This route can also be top roped from the chains for Dream Slate.    &lt;b&gt;Descent:&lt;/b&gt; Lower or walk off if you don\'t mind lethal exposure.&lt;br&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_10\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Anuresis - 5.9&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;br&gt;Coming Soon&lt;br&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_11\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Don\'t Jump Back Crack - 5.9+&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;br&gt;Coming Soon . . . &lt;br&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_12\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Solitary Confinement - 5.9+&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;br&gt;Coming Soon . . .&lt;br&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_13\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Essential Gear&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;br&gt;Essential gear should be described on a route by route basis. In general, all of these routes can be top-roped, although a number of the routes require trad anchors. While the rock at the base of the wall is somewhat loose, it is clean higher up, so helmets are probably not needed unless you\'re leading.&lt;br&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_14\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Other Info&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;br&gt;If you have additional info for routes described or have done a route not described in depth, please put the info here and I\'ll integrate it into the page!&lt;br&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_15\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Images&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div align=\"center\"&gt;&lt;table id=\"my_images\"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/june-29th-2005-the-rock/113714/c-165728\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"June 29th, 2005 - The rock...\" src=\"/images/square/113714.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/june-29th-2005-the-rock/113715/c-165728\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"June 29th, 2005 - The rock...\" src=\"/images/square/113715.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/june-29th-2005-narcolepsy/113720/c-165728\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"June 29th, 2005 - Narcolepsy...\" src=\"/images/square/113720.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/article&gt;date:'),(293,165734,'/north-ridge/165734','/broads-fork-twin-peaks/150522','North Ridge','','','II, cl. 3, Moderate Snow','','',4427,40.5939,-111.72,'Utah, United States, North America','','',150522,'Broads Fork Twin Peaks','','1.0','Scramble, Snow Climb','','Most of a day','Route','content: &lt;article&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_1\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2 id=\"first_h2\"&gt;Approach&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;br&gt;This is the ridge that divides &lt;a href=\"http://www.summitpost.org/show/route_link.pl/route_id/5670/object_id/390\"&gt;Stairs Gulch&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"http://www.summitpost.org/show/route_link.pl/route_id/189/object_id/390\"&gt;Broads Fork&lt;/a&gt;.

Apart from the secenery, the route has some interesting scrambling and is a little shorter and less tedious than the &lt;a href=\"http://www.summitpost.org/show/route_link.pl/route_id/3913/object_id/390\"&gt;Storm Mountain/BF Twins Traverse&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Another reason is that this may possibly be an even better route than the &lt;a href=\"http://www.summitpost.org/show/route_link.pl/route_id/1955/object_id/390\"&gt;Hounds Tooth Ridge&lt;/a&gt; for safe winter ascents, as the approach and ridge are free of avalanche danger. The route does cross some large slabs above Broads Fork, where glide avalanches may occur in springtime, but the Hounds Tooth also crosses similar slabs above Stairs Gulch. Although both of these routes are relatively safe winter routes for the BF Twins, use caution regarding cornices on the ridge and glide avalanching during the spring-time thaws.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Drive 4.2 miles up the canyon from the neon sign at the mouth of BCC. Park at the Broads Fork/Mill Fork B trailhead and head up Broads Fork trail, which heads to the west (near end of the parking lot).&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;table class=\"inline_image_thumbs\"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=106599\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/106599.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=106595\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/106595.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=106598\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/106598.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=106597\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/106597.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=113665\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/113665.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_2\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Route Description&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;br&gt;Follow the trail as it traverses into Broads Fork and crosses a stream on a bridge. From here, you will gain the ridge in different ways depending on the conditions.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When there is more snow on the ground, cut right and up towards the ridge whenever a good clearing presents itself, starting around 7,000 ft. In the summer this approach is very brushy, but if you hike up the trail until a small meadow is reached (ca. 7,300 ft), one can hike cross-country to the ridgeline with a little easy bushwacking.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Once on the ridge, stay on it as you climb higher. At 8,880 there is a flat spot on the ridge that could make a decent campsite. At 9,240 ft, there is a slight bowl in a flat area that would make a great winter campsite.  Just above this the slabs are reache at ca. 9,600 ft.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The slabs are polished quartzite, and as a result, can be very slippery, so be careful! In the winter you can probably just continue up the ridge as it is covered in a deep snowpack. In the summer, once the glide avalanches have fully uncovered the slabs, you can just traverse around about 80 ft below the ridge top. Climbing this route when only part of the snowpack has avalanched could be dangerous, and the climing difficulty to get around the remaining walls of snow likely exceed class 3.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As you traverse, the slab ends in a sudden 20 ft dropoff. Scramble back up to the ridgeline and downclimb a chimney (cl. 3) to get off the slab. From here one scrambles along the knife-edge ridge crest (cl. 2-3) until 10,000 ft. Here the ridge merges with the Robinson variation and the Storm Mountain/BF Twins Traverse. Ascend the 500 ft headwall, which is about 25-30 degrees and is still a slightly rounded ridge. This puts you on the Traverse from Storm Mountain, and past the crux of the route.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;At the top of the headwall, follow the ridgeline south east (left) for another 0.25 miles and 1,000 ft gain toward the Broads Fork Twins Summit.&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;table class=\"inline_image_thumbs\"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=113669\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/113669.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=113671\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/113671.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=113672\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/113672.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=113677\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/113677.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_3\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Essential Gear&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;br&gt;During the summer months, a pair of trail running shoes can work just fine.

While hidden from most views, it is very prominent from Hidden Peak. I assume this couloir is named after a short line of pipe encountered at the top of the couloir.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This couloir, which ascends at about 42&deg;-50&deg; for 1,000 ft, is popular for ski mountaineers in the winter. According to &lt;a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1585920606/summitpost-20\"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Ice Climbing Utah&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, by Dave Black, it is also a popular mid to late summer snow climb or alpine ice climb, depending on timing. If you include the bowl below, it ascends for about 1,400 vertical feet. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Some things to note about this couloir - first, it is very narrow and there is a lot of loose rock at the top (mostly in the pebble to foot size), so watch out for moutain goats above, and stay out of the runnel as much as possible (although routefinding will require many crossings). Second, I found that it had formed moats almost continuously along its sides. Some of these were rather deep and all had snow that was much softer than in the rest of the couloir. Finally, the snow in the couloir seems to form cracks across the width of the couloir that require climbing over snow bridges or around the side near the rock. Once again, the snow here is likely to be much softer than the surrounding snow, and the cracks are often too deep to climb through. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Technically the couloirs in Utah don\'t have the altitude, steepness, and shading needed to retain year-round every year, but snow in these couloirs often last until late summer, when it has settled into harder neve with occasional spatterings of ice. That pretty well describes this route. The &lt;i&gt;Ice Climbing Utah&lt;/i&gt; guidebook lists this as an AI 2 route. Personally, when I climbed it it was more like a neve climb - ice screws wouldn\'t have been very useful, but I often had to use the front points of my campons as steps couldn\'t be kick very deep.&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;table class=\"inline_image_thumbs\"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=116716\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/116716.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=115909\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/115909.JPG\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_2\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Approach&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;br&gt;Park at the Snowbird Mountain Resort parking lot, just before the lodge. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Continue walking toward the lodge and walk across a bridge that forks off the road to the right. Follow the dirt road past two junctures (the second having a paved trail). Take the third juncture, which is marked as the Gad Valley trail.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Follow the trail as it enters the next drainage and meets up with another track. Go left and stay on this track as it switchbacks up the drainage, past a ski lift. Stay on trails, and always take the left option when the trail forks. Eventually you will start to enter a large bowl beneath the American Fork Twin Peaks (on the right) and Hidden Peak (on the left). The route begins here.&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;table class=\"inline_image_thumbs\"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=116975\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/116975.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=116976\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/116976.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_3\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Route Description&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Gad Valley Trail begins to splinter here. Take a trail that heads west (right) toward another bowl beneath the American Fork Twins. As you head this way, a hidden couloir will slowly come into view. After passing the base of a small ridge, cut across the next bowl toward the base of the couloir. The snow slopes here are about 30&deg;-35&deg;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The couloir is fairly narrow (about 15-20 ft wide) with vertical rocks on the sides. This requires you to constantly cross the runnel in the center as you find the best route up the chute. Once in the chute the angle increases. The snow is supposed to be around 42&deg; in steepness when smooth, but later in the year as it develops depressions, it is mostly headwalls of 45&deg;-50&deg; with regular small easings of the slope.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The couloir gets steeper as you climb higher, and several cracks in the snow may form across the couloir, requiring crossing snowbridges. Be mindful of soft snow around these and the moats lining the side of the couloir.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Don\'t be tempted to leave the couloir when the rock on the left becomes more broken. Stay in the chute all the way to the top, where you will exit either onto steep rock (left) or loose gravel (right) before reaching the very top. From here it is an easy class 2-3 scramble up a 50 ft headwall and then class 1 walking across the final 50 ft slope above to the summit. A snowfield often blocks this final slope for most of the year. This can be avoided by walking around it on class 1 slabs to the west.&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;table class=\"inline_image_thumbs\"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=116977\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/116977.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=116978\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/116978.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=116979\" rel=\"no_follow\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/thumb/116979.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_4\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Essential Gear&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;br&gt;Crampons, helmet, ice axe (possibly two). Some parties may want to use belays - in this case, pickets and flukes are more likely to be useful than ice screws. I wouldn\'t recommend making gear anchors on the rock as it is often loose and the couloir seems to form nasty moats along the edges.&lt;br&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_5\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Images&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div align=\"center\"&gt;&lt;table id=\"my_images\"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/the-crest-of-the-pipeline-couloir/721086/c-165992\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"The crest of the Pipeline Couloir\" src=\"/images/square/721086.JPG\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/the-pipeline-couloir/512390/c-165992\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"The Pipeline Couloir\" src=\"/images/square/512390.JPG\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/the-pipeline-couloir-to-af-twin-west/721090/c-165992\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"The Pipeline Couloir to AF Twin (west)\" src=\"/images/square/721090.JPG\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/july-25th-2005-approaching/116976/c-165992\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"July 25th, 2005 - Approaching...\" src=\"/images/square/116976.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/the-pipeline-couloir/517443/c-165992\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"The Pipeline Couloir\" src=\"/images/square/517443.JPG\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/july-25th-2005-entering/116977/c-165992\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"July 25th, 2005 - Entering...\" src=\"/images/square/116977.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/july-25th-2005-about-1-3rd/116978/c-165992\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"July 25th, 2005 - About 1/3rd...\" src=\"/images/square/116978.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/pipeline-aka-the-easy-way-up/116716/c-165992\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Pipeline, aka the easy way up...\" src=\"/images/square/116716.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/july-25th-2005-looking/116979/c-165992\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"July 25th, 2005 - Looking...\" src=\"/images/square/116979.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/caption-under-construction/115909/c-165992\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Caption under construction ....\" src=\"/images/square/115909.JPG\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/july-25th-2005-approaching/116975/c-165992\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"July 25th, 2005 - Approaching...\" src=\"/images/square/116975.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/article&gt;date:'),(295,283772,'/selaginella/283772','/yosemite-valley-logistical-center/150992','Selaginella','','','II 5.8','','II',4570,37.74,-119.58,'California, United States, North America','','4',150992,'Yosemite Valley - Logistical Center','5.8 (YDS)','0.8','Trad Climbing','Spring, Summer, Fall','Half a day','Route','content: &lt;article&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_1\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2 id=\"first_h2\"&gt;Overview&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;i&gt;Selaginella&lt;/i&gt; ascends the 2nd tier of cliffs in the Five Open Books area just left of Yosemite Falls.

Gear belay.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Pitch 4:&lt;/b&gt; 5.8, 160 feet.  Move up the obvious right-facing dihedral with a hand crack.  Continue up a series of intermittent small dihedrals with thin cracks.  Eventually reach a narrow ledge.  Traverse left to a 15 foot flake.

Agassiz that I climbed with Vladimir Sofiyev in 2006. I suspect it\'s new because not only is there nothing in that area listed in Secor, but the rock was incredibly loose and there were no signs of anyone else having climbed the line. In fact, I don\'t really recommend this route, except perhaps in winter when much of the loose rock is covered in snow and frozen together.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The route has two 5.8+ offwidth cruxes. The route may be harder now, as the second crux turned out to be a gap between a large detached block and the main face. The detached block peeled off as I finished the section.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So why did I put up this route?  When the loose rock is covered in snow it might actually be nice. Also, it can serve as a warning of what line NOT to take if you\'re climbing the NE Face route!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div align=\"center\" class=\"image\" style=\"width: 506px;\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"/mt-agassiz-rolling-stones-map/636969\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Mt Agassiz: Rolling Stones Map\" height=\"472\" width=\"500\" src=\"/images/medium/636969.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=\"caption\"&gt;A topographic map showing the Rolling Stones route on Mt Agassiz from the common approach via Sam Mack Meadows.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;noformat&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;table border=\"1\" cellspacing=\"0\"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt; &lt;table border=\"0\" cellspacing=\"2\" cellpadding=\"2\"&gt;&lt;tr bgcolor=\"#c0c0c0\"&gt;&lt;td colspan=\"7\"&gt;&lt;font style=\"font-weight:bold;\"&gt; &lt;/font&gt;&lt;center&gt;Mt Agassiz - Rolling Stones: Route Stats&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td align=\"center\"&gt;&lt;font style=\"font-weight:bold;\"&gt;RT Total&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td align=\"center\"&gt;&lt;font style=\"font-weight:bold;\"&gt;Total to Summit&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td align=\"center\"&gt;&lt;i&gt;TH to Sam Mack Meadows&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td align=\"center\"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Approach&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td align=\"center\"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Route&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td align=\"center\"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Descent&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;b&gt;Distance (miles)&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td align=\"center\"&gt;18.47&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td align=\"center\"&gt;9.06&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td align=\"center\"&gt;&lt;i&gt;6.93&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td align=\"center\"&gt;&lt;i&gt;1.77&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td align=\"center\"&gt;&lt;i&gt;0.36&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td align=\"center\"&gt;&lt;i&gt;2.48&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr bgcolor=\"#e0e0e0\"&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;b&gt;Elevation Gain (ft)&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td align=\"center\"&gt;6,944&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td align=\"center\"&gt;6,377&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td align=\"center\"&gt;&lt;i&gt;3,565&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td align=\"center\"&gt;&lt;i&gt;1,962&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td align=\"center\"&gt;&lt;i&gt;850&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td align=\"center\"&gt;&lt;i&gt;325&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;b&gt;Elevation Loss (ft)&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td align=\"center\"&gt;6,944&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td align=\"center\"&gt;502&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td align=\"center\"&gt;&lt;i&gt;242&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td align=\"center\"&gt;&lt;i&gt;211&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td align=\"center\"&gt;&lt;i&gt;49&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td align=\"center\"&gt;&lt;i&gt;2,877&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td colspan=\"7\"&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;i&gt;Estimates from Topo!, which tends to slightly overestimate elevation, underestimate mileage, and ignores small-scale additions to mileage and elevation changes.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/noformat&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_2\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Getting There&lt;/h2&gt;Approach via North Fork of Big Pine from the Glacier Lodge trailhead. Take the trail to Sam Mack Meadows and climb the right-hand chute (cl. 2-3), bypassing a large boulder on the right. This section can have a lot of water and some ice buildup in later season, and sometimes the easier variations involve climbing through spaces in the rocks. Next, follow the series of slabs in the drainage as you make your way to the Thunderbolt Glacier. When you reach the first lake at 11,790\', ascend towards the right, passing another lake on your right as you aim for the saddle between the E Ridge of Mt. Agassiz and the W Ridge of Mt. Robinson. From there, head towards the prominent couloir that cuts up the right side of the NE Face of Mt. Agassiz.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Another option could be to hike to 5th Lake and then head cross-country up the drainage that empties there. This may be a bit more distance, but not as steep. This might not be as good as it looks to require a lot more boulder-hopping, while the former approach has a lot of nice travel on slabs and meadow.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;noformat&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;table&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;div align=\"center\" class=\"image\" style=\"width: 206px;\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"/winchell-agassiz-col/633887\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Winchell-Agassiz Col\" height=\"71\" width=\"200\" src=\"/images/small/633887.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=\"caption\"&gt;Agassiz Col&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;div align=\"center\" class=\"image\" style=\"width: 206px;\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"/loose-rock-city-on-agassiz/633886\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Loose Rock City on Agassiz\" height=\"150\" width=\"200\" src=\"/images/small/633886.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=\"caption\"&gt;SE Face &amp;amp; E Ridge of Mt.

After ascending about 100 ft, climb out of the couloir to the left, following a series of sloping ledges with lots of scree and sand. The ledges ascend at an angle in a series of 4th class steps as you angle up and left into the NE Face. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The first third of the route (300 vertical feet) has a lot of loose rock but goes at 3rd to low 5th class. We simul-climbed it. One problem is that the follower cannot stay out of the fall line and the leader will probably knock down a lot of small rocks.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;After the first third the terrain steepens for the next third (300 vertical feet) and the climbing becomes much cleaner. A thin ledge traverse leads over to a series of wide chimneys and left-facing corners, which go up to 5.8. The terrain here is still broken so we continued simul-climbing for most of it. The final \"chimney\", which transitioned to a mantle to a ledge on the left turned out to be a detached block that fell off as I finished it, so that section might be an easier or more difficult face climb.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For the last third of the route (300 vertical feet), you reach a broad ledge and the terrain above becomes vertical to overhanging. Here we traversed right through a notch and a short 4th-5th class downclimb to another ledge system. This ledge system wraps around and joins the upper section of the NE Face route, which is a nice 5.2 ridge. This ridge is clean and enjoyable to climb, leading all the way to the summit.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div align=\"center\" class=\"image\" style=\"width: 506px;\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"/rolling-stones-on-mt-agassiz/633884\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Rolling Stones, on Mt Agassiz\" height=\"375\" width=\"500\" src=\"/images/medium/633884.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=\"caption\"&gt;Routes on the NE Side of Mt Agassiz.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_4\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Descent&lt;/h2&gt;From the summit the best descent is to downclimb the &lt;a href=\"http://www.summitpost.org/route/159004/southeast-side-via-agassiz-col.html\"&gt;SE Ridge to Agassiz Col&lt;/a&gt;. This route is class 3, but snowfields linger late into the year, so bring crampons. If you descend this on a cold day or at night, the snow might be frozen and you will have to downclimb closer to the crest, which is broken cl. 5.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div align=\"center\" class=\"image\" style=\"width: 506px;\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"/descent-routes-from-mt-agassiz/633892\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Descent Routes from Mt Agassiz\" height=\"369\" width=\"500\" src=\"/images/medium/633892.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=\"caption\"&gt;The SE Ridge of Mt.

Featuring over 200 manmade routes ranging from WI2-WI6 and M4 - M9, this park has more climbing than anyone can fit in over several weekend trips. Easy access, and plentiful natural and man-made anchors make setting up climbs fast and easy, and climbers can switch to new routes with minimal effort, allowing for much more time to climb! The Park is located in the stunning Uncompahgre River Gorge, just outside the historic town of &lt;a href=\"http://www.ouraycolorado.com/\"&gt;Ouray&lt;/a&gt;. The length of the gorge that encompasses the Ice Park is roughly one mile long. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Ice Park is owned by the town of Ouray, and only a small portion lies on private property, owned by Eric Jacobsen, owner and operator of Ouray Hydroelectric. He was kind enough to let some local ice climbing entrepeneurs harvest some of the water to create the spectacular walls and pillars of ice that comprise the park.  A volunteer force set up a system of hoses and pipes, with spigots that shot streams of water over the walls (AKA Ice Farming), which then froze up into different routes. As the park increases in popularity, this pipeline has been extended to create new climbing areas. The Park and its infrastructure are jointly owned and managed by the City of Ouray as mentioned above, the nonprofit &lt;a href=\"http://www.ouraycolorado.com/listing/icepark\"&gt;Ouray Ice Park, Inc. (OIPI)&lt;/a&gt;. There are no permits needed to be signed (&lt;a href=\"http://www.summitpost.org/lake-city-ice-park/837806\"&gt;Lake City Ice park&lt;/a&gt; asks you to sign a waiver). Each winter, OIPI hosts the Ouray Ice Festival to celebrate the Park. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;To this day the park has been built and maintained entirely by enthusiastic volunteers, as well as donated materials and capital. The park also receives income from members and donations, which can be given at the main entrance at the Upper Bridge, or you can buy voluntary &lt;a href=\"http://ourayicepark.com/about/membership/\"&gt;membership&lt;/a&gt; on-line. Because of this, &lt;i&gt;admission to the park is free for everyone &lt;/i&gt;despite the high cost of its maintenance.&lt;i&gt; &lt;/i&gt;In nearly 20 years of operation, it has become one of the premier ice climbing venues in the world.&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;You can read about history of the park in this &lt;a href=\"http://www.summitpost.org/view_object.php?object_id=768804&amp;amp;confirm_post=7\"&gt;article&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_2\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How To Get There&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;u&gt;The Ouray Ice Park&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/b&gt; is located in the historic mining town of Ouray, Colorado in the southwestern corner of the state. It is surrounded by &lt;a href=\"http://www.summitpost.org/san-juan-range/171122\"&gt;San Juan Mountain&lt;/a&gt; range. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;You can travel to Ouray by automobile or fly into one of several nearby locations. The closest regional airport is located in Montrose (about 45 minutes away), Grand Junction (2 hrs), or Durango (2 hrs). Driving from Denver takes approximately 6 hrs. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;blockquote style=\"margin: 0 0 0 40px; border: none; padding: 0px;\"&gt;&lt;blockquote style=\"margin: 0

You can either drive there and park at the turn off for Camp Bird Road (it is well signed), or you can walk from town via the backroad accessed from the end of 3rd Avenue. I like to hike in - you get to see the less often visited parts of the climb and hike along the Gazebo, Shithouse Wall, and Five Fingers area. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;b style=\"text-decoration: underline; \"&gt;Parking &lt;/b&gt;- there is a large parking area on the east side of the Hwy 550 (just south of town). You can see the Ice Park from this parking area. Parking is free. There is a closer and much smaller parking lot on Camp Bird Road - this one gets typically filled very on. If you continue on Camp Bird Road, you can drive up all the way to the Senator Gulch parking area ~ 4 miles and access many &lt;a href=\"http://www.summitpost.org/ouray-colorado-camp-bird-road/168218\"&gt;backcountry climbs&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_3\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Park Rules and Etiquette&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div align=\"center\" class=\"image-left\" style=\"width: 281px; \"&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=831888\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/medium/831888.JPG\" alt=\"Ice farming\" style=\"width: 275px; height: 182.60000000000002px; \"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=\"caption\"&gt;Ice farming = spraying water into the gorge&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div align=\"center\" class=\"image-right\" style=\"width: 281px; \"&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=601378\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/medium/601378.jpg\" alt=\"Ouray Ice  Climbing\" style=\"width: 275px; height: 183.15px; \"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=\"caption\"&gt;Ouray Ice Park&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;1. Crampons and helmets are required for ALL persons (climbers or otherwise) in the established and posted \"Climbers Only\" areas. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;2. All persons under the age of 18 must be accompanied by an adult&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;3. Dogs must be leashed and attended while in the Ouray Ice Park and no dogs are allowed in the bottom of the gorge. You must also pick up after your pet. (I have seen dogs in South Park area, although against the rules).&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;4. All climbing in the \"School Room\" area must be on fixed, numbered  and defined anchors only.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;5. Hours of operation are sunup to sundown - sorry, no night time climbing! The water is dripping during that time.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;6. Do not anchor to any man-made structures, including the rail or walkway above the School Room, nor to the pipe line, or any other ice producing fixtures or equipment.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;7. Do not redirect shower heads, turn off valves, or otherwise tramper with any ice making equipment. Doing so may cause the system to freeze up. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;u&gt;Etiquette:&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;1. Consider supporting the park by purchasing an annual membership. You can buy it on-line. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;2. Leave gear on the anchor before you begin a climb, if you are leading a route. It will prevent someone from rappelling onto you. If you find gear on an anchor, leave it there. Somebody will come back for it. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;3. Whenever possible, use the walk down path to get to the base of the route you intend to climb. Please avoid rappelling into the gorge unless you have visually inspected the area to ensure no one will be hit with falling ice. Numerous injuries have been caused while rappelling. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;4. Yell \"ROPE\" loudly before throwing your rope into the gorge. Better yet get a visual to ensure that no one is below or leading the route. It is very difficult to hear people in the gorge from above. It is also advised, when top-ropping, to have your partner at the bottom to retrieve the rope if it falls in the river. Frozen ropes are not fun to handle. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;5. Do not take gear of a route. If there is a quickdraw left on a route, then someone is working on red pointing that route. Quick draws left on bolts are not abandoned gear and should be left in place. They may have been left for competition as well. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;6. Be aware of people climbing above you if you are climbing or belaying at the base of a route. Ice can fall a long way and cause serious injury. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;7. Learn how to belay safely from the top of a route. Belay off the anchor rather than your harness.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;8. The Ice Park gets a lot of climbing traffic, so please be gentle and precise with the ice. Don\'t purposefully bash or knock off the ice unless it poses a safety hazard. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;9. The water is turned on the Park most weekday evenings in the winter at 4:00 PM. The Park \"Ice Meister\" begins turning the spigots on in the South Park and moves north. Please be respectful of the Park workers and exit the climbing areas during this time to allow for the new ice to be formed. (I have done it - left the South Park when the worker started to turn on water and still had enough time to do a couple of climbs in the Scottish Gullies area). &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_4\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The Ouray Ice Festival&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div align=\"center\" class=\"image-left\" style=\"width: 156px; \"&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=835088\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/medium/835088.jpg\" alt=\"Great performance\" style=\"width: 150px; height: 238.5px;\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=\"caption\"&gt;Great competition&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div align=\"center\" class=\"image-right\" style=\"width: 156px; \"&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=835099\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/medium/835099.jpg\" alt=\"another competitor\" style=\"width: 150px; height: 223.7142857142857px; \"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=\"caption\"&gt;Mixed Elite Comp&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;The Ouray Ice Festival, held each January is an eclectic gathering of ice climbers, gear manufacturers, and ice climbing enthusiasts. The international Festival was first held in January 1996 and now is widely recognized as the premier event of its kind. The competition is really for professional climbers and watching these elite athletes push themselves on the wild and difficult routes is both thrilling and awe inspiring. There are also numerous interactive clinics held during the festival taught by various climbers (e.g. Steve House), guides, and many of the competitors. Attending a clinic is a great opportunity to get to know and learn from these pros, as well as meet other climbers. Most manufacturers of anything related to the sport of ice climbing are also present, displaying their latest and greatest new toys for participants to demo. The festivities continue into the evenings with dinner buffets, sideshows and movie presentations by numerous famous climbers, as well as gear auctions and lively dance parties. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;There are family activities as well. The festival provides free training for youngsters via the Kid\'s College. There is also a zip line across the gorge, and sometimes a hot tub. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;u&gt;2013&lt;/u&gt; Competition Album &lt;a href=\"http://www.summitpost.org/ouray-ice-festival-2013/835075\"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_5\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Climbing in the Ice Park&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;div align=\"center\" class=\"image-left\" style=\"width: 456px; \"&gt;&lt;a href=\"/february-11th-2005-a/97742\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"February 11th, 2005 - A...\" height=\"650\" width=\"488\" src=\"/images/original/97742.jpg\" style=\"width: 450px; height: 599.3852459016393px;\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=\"caption\"&gt;Rapelling into the gorge&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;The typical &lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;climbing season&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt; in the Park runs from mid-December through April 1, but can very by season. Check out park information on current conditions. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;The Ice Park is popular and some climbing areas are crowded, especially on weekends and holidays. It is a park rule that you always wear a helmet and crampons when in the Ice Park. Walking around the top of the climbs can be especially hazardous, as well, so you should aways wear crampons whenever near the rim. Free soloing can be fun and spiritually enriching, but you will put yourself at much greater risk by doing so in the Park. You never know when somebody may knock down a piece of ice or snow or even throw a rope down on you while climbing. It is best to solo using some form of self belaying device (several different ones available at Ouray Mountain Sports). &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;The gorge was created by water and water still runs through it, even in the winter. Be aware that the river is not always well frozen, and this can be hard to tell after fresh snow have covered the canyon floor, hiding potential weak spots. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Anchors and belaying&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;: most accidents happen as a results of human error, which include rappelling and anchoring. Make sure you create good anchors. Many areas have built in chains (Fiver Fingers), bolts (marked with orange poles), and chain anchors (School Room Area). Some areas require to create anchors from trees, so bring adequate equipment (long slings, webbing, cord - it is recommended to have about 20 to 30 feet long webbing/cord for some of the areas , extra biners etc). &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;When belaying at the bottom of the gorge, it is often hard to stand right at the base of the climb - there is a hazard of falling ice from above. It is safer to move away from the ice wall, perhaps to the far side of the gorge. Bring a longer rope - 70 meter much better - to make this more possible. Belayer may consider anchoring himself since he has to belay far away from the climb. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;b style=\"font-style: italic; \"&gt;Equipment: &lt;/b&gt;All climbs are single pitch, although some areas require 70 meter rope and belaying from the top of the climb (Upper Bridge area). &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Ice Axes - Leashless ice climbing tools are the standard at the Park. It does make switching the tools and hanging tools over your shoulder while using a hand etc. much easier. If you happen to drop your ice tool into the river, ask at Ouray Mountain Sports for their ice retrieval magnet apparatus. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Crampons and Footwear - many professionals use fruit boots (boots with integrated crampons), most climbers use crampon compatible boots. If you have any questions about your gear, ask experts at &lt;a href=\"http://ouraysports.com/\"&gt;Ouray Mountain Sports&lt;/a&gt; for their advice. They have very large selection of gear, and they also have a rental equipment. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;i&gt;Useful Information&lt;/i&gt;: First Aid Kit with some Band-Aids, Steri-strips, gauze is very handy. Ice chips tend to cause a lot of facial cuts. The closest hospital would be in Montrose. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;There is a cellular coverage throughout the park. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;b style=\"font-style: italic; \"&gt;Getting Around the Park &lt;/b&gt;is easy. The Ice Park and Uncompahgre Gorge run in a generally Southern to Northern direction. The various climbing areas are all located in and along the Western side of the gorge. The South Park and New Funtier are well signed, Gazebo Wall is the most northern one, closest to the town and there is a Gazebo above it. Shithouse Wall has restrooms above it. Five Fingers area - directly across from parking area off Hwy 550 has long chains running across the dirt snow covered road. Then there is Lower Bridge area and Upper Bridge area. Scottish Gullies are between Five Fingers and Lower bridge. Upper Bridge area continues into Alcove, and then into School Room area, which has a nice walkway above it. The approaches are short and take less than 10 minutes. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;All climbs are accessed from the top (exception Kid\'s Wall), and most areas (exception Upper Bridge) can also be accesses via some form of walk-down descent path. Most areas can be easily viewed from the bridges (except South Park and New Funtier). &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_6\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;South Park&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;u&gt;South Park&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/b&gt; is the furthest upstream and southernmost climbing area in the Ice Park. It was named after the popular adult TV cartoon series and the route names were selected from different episodes. It is popular with mountain guides and beginners/intermediates. It is a large area, and can get pretty crowded. The approach takes about 10 minutes, and is well marked. The Gorge is wider and sunnier here. Most routes have trees for anchoring, but they are quite a distance from the rim, so bring long webbing (20 to 30 feet, rope, or cordelette for constructing and extending anchors). A couple of routes have bolts for anchors. There are 2 walk down, descent paths, one on each end. Both path are equipped with hand lines to assist on the steep, icy walk. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;There are 32 routes in South Park, ranging from WI2-WI5.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;noformat&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;table border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"3\" bgcolor=\"lightgrey\"&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;div align=\"center\" class=\"image\" style=\"width: 206px;\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"/south-park-pillar/772497\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"South Park pillar\" height=\"133\" width=\"200\" src=\"/images/small/772497.JPG\" style=\"\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span class=\"caption\"&gt;South Park Pilar&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;div align=\"center\" class=\"image\" style=\"width: 156px;\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"/feb-2006-ouray-ice-park-me/149441\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Feb 2006: Ouray Ice Park - me...\" height=\"200\" width=\"150\" src=\"/images/small/149441.jpg\" style=\"\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span class=\"caption\"&gt;South Park&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;div align=\"center\" class=\"image\" style=\"width: 206px;\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"/south-park/597395\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"south park\" height=\"150\" width=\"200\" src=\"/images/small/597395.JPG\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span class=\"caption\"&gt;Leading in South Park&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;div align=\"center\" class=\"image\" style=\"width: 139px;\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"/fun-in-the-south-park/835803\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Fun in the South Park\" height=\"200\" width=\"133\" src=\"/images/small/835803.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span class=\"caption\"&gt;Fun in the South Park&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;div align=\"center\" class=\"image\" style=\"width: 139px;\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"/practicing-leading/768813\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Practicing leading\" height=\"200\" width=\"133\" src=\"/images/small/768813.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span class=\"caption\"&gt;Practicing leading&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;div align=\"center\" class=\"image\" style=\"width: 139px;\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"/go-charlotte-go/835804\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Go Charlotte, go...\" height=\"200\" width=\"133\" src=\"/images/small/835804.jpg\" style=\"\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span class=\"caption\"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;div align=\"center\" class=\"image\" style=\"width: 139px;\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"/south-park-gorge-from-the-top/699736\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"South Park Gorge from the top\" height=\"200\" width=\"133\" src=\"/images/small/699736.jpg\" style=\"\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span class=\"caption\"&gt;View into South Park&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;div align=\"center\" class=\"image\" style=\"width: 156px;\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"/february-11-2005-wynn/97714\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"February 11, 2005 - Wynn...\" height=\"200\" width=\"150\" src=\"/images/small/97714.jpg\" style=\"\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span class=\"caption\"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;div align=\"center\" class=\"image\" style=\"width: 139px;\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"/south-park-gorge/699735\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"South Park Gorge\" height=\"200\" width=\"133\" src=\"/images/small/699735.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span class=\"caption\"&gt;Inside the gorge&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;div align=\"center\" class=\"image\" style=\"width: 135px;\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"/southpark-wi-3/768406\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Southpark, WI 3\" height=\"200\" width=\"129\" src=\"/images/small/768406.JPG\" style=\"\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span class=\"caption\"&gt;Dow leading&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/noformat&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_7\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;New Funtier&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;b&gt;The New Funtier&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/u&gt; is a smaller area when compared to South Park and you will see a sing posting for turn off from the main path towards the South Park. It is suitable for beginners and intermediate climbers. There is a steep walk-down path equipped with a hand line on the upstream end of the area. It is hard to walk inside the gorge between the South Park and New Funtier - tons of rocks, trees, and not recommended. It is slightly less crowded area. The approach takes about 5 minutes. Use trees for anchoring.&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;There are 19 routes here ranging from WI2 to WI4, and M6&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;noformat&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;table border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"3\" bgcolor=\"lightgrey\"&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;div align=\"center\" class=\"image\" style=\"width: 206px;\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"/new-funtier/831524\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"New Funtier\" height=\"133\" width=\"200\" src=\"/images/small/831524.JPG\" style=\"\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span class=\"caption\"&gt;Pocahontas WI4&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;div align=\"center\" class=\"image\" style=\"width: 139px;\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"/new-funtier/831525\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"New Funtier\" height=\"200\" width=\"133\" src=\"/images/small/831525.jpg\" style=\"\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span class=\"caption\"&gt;New Funtier&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;div align=\"center\" class=\"image\" style=\"width: 156px;\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"/new-funtier-route/477879\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"new funtier route\" height=\"200\" width=\"150\" src=\"/images/small/477879.JPG\" style=\"\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span class=\"caption\"&gt;New Funtier&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;div align=\"center\" class=\"image\" style=\"width: 206px;\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"/set-up-for-soloing/831523\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Set up for soloing\" height=\"133\" width=\"200\" src=\"/images/small/831523.JPG\" style=\"\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span class=\"caption\"&gt;Rope soloing in New Funtier&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;div align=\"center\" class=\"image\" style=\"width: 139px;\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"/new-funtier/831522\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"New Funtier\" height=\"200\" width=\"133\" src=\"/images/small/831522.jpg\" style=\"\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span class=\"caption\"&gt;New Funtier&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;div align=\"center\" class=\"image\" style=\"width: 139px;\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"/my-little-route-in-new-funtier/834485\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"My little route in New Funtier\" height=\"200\" width=\"133\" src=\"/images/small/834485.jpg\" style=\"\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span class=\"caption\"&gt;My little route&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;div align=\"center\" class=\"image\" style=\"width: 206px;\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"/ryan-on-the-cook-wi3/832827\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Ryan on The Cook (WI3)\" height=\"150\" width=\"200\" src=\"/images/small/832827.JPG\" style=\"\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span class=\"caption\"&gt;The Cook WI3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;div align=\"center\" class=\"image\" style=\"width: 156px;\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"/soloing-jimmy-cracked-corner-wi2/832844\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Soloing Jimmy Cracked Corner (WI2-)\" height=\"200\" width=\"150\" src=\"/images/small/832844.JPG\" style=\"\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span class=\"caption\"&gt;Jimmy Cracked Corner WI2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;div align=\"center\" class=\"image\" style=\"width: 206px;\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"/colorful-anchors-in-the-ice-park/834484\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Colorful anchors in the ice park\" height=\"133\" width=\"200\" src=\"/images/small/834484.JPG\" style=\"\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span class=\"caption\"&gt;Colorful anchors&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;div align=\"center\" class=\"image\" style=\"width: 156px;\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"/captain-goddamnit-in-the-new-funtier/589334\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Captain Goddamnit in the New Funtier\" height=\"200\" width=\"150\" src=\"/images/small/589334.jpg\" style=\"\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span class=\"caption\"&gt;Captain Goddamnit WI3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/noformat&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_8\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Graduate School&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;u&gt;The Graduate School&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/b&gt; is located just upstream from the School Room area. The gorge is taller here, so the routes are longer (two ropes are needed if you want to top rope from the bottom), and a few of the climbs often do not touch down to the bottom. As such, this area is best suited to belay from the top. Use trees as anchors. It is usually not crowded. I climbed there only with my soloist device. The routes started steeper and got pretty mellow higher up. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;There are 5 routes here, ranging from WI2 to WI4&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;. Approach is via the path to South Park (but you turn off before New Funtier and before the South Park areas), or just continuing past School Room area. The climbs are just upstream of the walk down path where it crosses underneath a small pipeline trestle. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;noformat&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;table border=\"1\" cellpading=\"3\" bgcolor=\"lightgrey\"&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;div align=\"center\" class=\"image\" style=\"width: 206px;\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"/climbing-with-ushba-ascender/771721\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Climbing with Ushba ascender\" height=\"150\" width=\"200\" src=\"/images/small/771721.JPG\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span class=\"caption\"&gt;Master\'s Degree WI3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;div align=\"center\" class=\"image\" style=\"width: 156px;\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view-into-school-room/842357\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"View into School Room\" height=\"200\" width=\"150\" src=\"/images/small/842357.jpg\" style=\"\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span class=\"caption\"&gt;View into the School Room&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;div align=\"center\" class=\"image\" style=\"width: 156px;\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"/inside-grad-school/842358\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Inside Grad School\" height=\"200\" width=\"150\" src=\"/images/small/842358.jpg\" style=\"cursor: nw-resize; \"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span class=\"caption\"&gt;Inside Grad School&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;div align=\"center\" class=\"image\" style=\"width: 156px;\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"/organic-chemistry-wi4/842359\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Organic Chemistry WI4\" height=\"200\" width=\"150\" src=\"/images/small/842359.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span class=\"caption\"&gt;Organic Chemistry WI4&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;div align=\"center\" class=\"image\" style=\"width: 206px;\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"/my-best-ice-climbing-partner/696906\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"My best ice climbing partner\" height=\"150\" width=\"200\" src=\"/images/small/696906.JPG\" style=\"\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span class=\"caption\"&gt;My rope solo system&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/noformat&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_9\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;noformat&gt;&lt;center&gt;School Room&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/noformat&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;u&gt;The School Room&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/b&gt; is the most convenient, most popular area, and you better get there early to get your anchor. It is very popular with professional instructions. It is located just past the Upper Bridge area. It features several nice, easy and moderate  climbs all equipped with bolted anchors at the top along the boardwalk. It is popular with lessons, but there are easier climbs in South Park and New Funtier area. Do not anchor between the bolted anchors and be very aware of falling ice when at the bottom of the climbs. There is a nice descend ladder at the start of the boardwalk. 70 meter rope is recommended. &lt;br&gt;From the Upper Bridge area, walk through the \"Climbers Only\" gate towards the suspended School Room Trestle on the obvious trail. There are two descent ways - one already mentioned descend ladder before you cross the Trestle and another walk-down descent path with hand lines on the upstream end of the School Room. Make sure you set up your anchor from above before heading down, you risk having someone else throw rope down on top of you. &lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;There are 17 routes here, ranging from WI2-WI5/M4-M6&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;noformat&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;table border=\"1\" celppading=\"3\" bgcolor=\"lightgrey\"&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;div align=\"center\" class=\"image\" style=\"width: 139px;\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"/dean-s-list-ice-wi4/766103\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Dean s List Ice WI4\" height=\"200\" width=\"133\" src=\"/images/small/766103.jpg\" style=\"\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span class=\"caption\"&gt;Dean\'s List Ice WI4&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;div align=\"center\" class=\"image\" style=\"width: 206px;\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"/opening-day-in-the-ice-park/769103\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Opening Day in the Ice Park\" height=\"150\" width=\"200\" src=\"/images/small/769103.jpg\" style=\"\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span class=\"caption\"&gt;Dunce WI4&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;div align=\"center\" class=\"image\" style=\"width: 156px;\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"/february-11th-2005-wynn/97728\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"February 11th, 2005 - Wynn...\" height=\"200\" width=\"150\" src=\"/images/small/97728.jpg\" style=\"\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span class=\"caption\"&gt;Pellucid Wombat in School&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;div align=\"center\" class=\"image\" style=\"width: 139px;\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"/school-room/605220\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"School Room\" height=\"200\" width=\"133\" src=\"/images/small/605220.jpg\" style=\"cursor: nw-resize; \"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span class=\"caption\"&gt;Rappel into School&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;div align=\"center\" class=\"image\" style=\"width: 156px;\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"/february-11th-2005-wynn/97733\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"February 11th, 2005 - Wynn...\" height=\"200\" width=\"150\" src=\"/images/small/97733.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span class=\"caption\"&gt;Drytooling in School&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;div align=\"center\" class=\"image\" style=\"width: 206px;\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"/february-11th-2005-yours/97735\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"February 11th, 2005 - Yours...\" height=\"150\" width=\"200\" src=\"/images/small/97735.jpg\" style=\"\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span class=\"caption\"&gt;Pellucid Wombat on Schoolroom Pillar?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;div align=\"center\" class=\"image\" style=\"width: 156px;\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"/february-11th-2005-an-ice/97731\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"February 11th, 2005 - An ice...\" height=\"200\" width=\"150\" src=\"/images/small/97731.jpg\" style=\"\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span class=\"caption\"&gt;Ice Column&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;div align=\"center\" class=\"image\" style=\"width: 139px;\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view-into-the-school-room/834483\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"View into the School Room\" height=\"200\" width=\"133\" src=\"/images/small/834483.jpg\" style=\"\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span class=\"caption\"&gt;view into school&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;div align=\"center\" class=\"image\" style=\"width: 206px;\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"/school-room-pillar-wi5/842363\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"School Room Pillar WI5\" height=\"133\" width=\"200\" src=\"/images/small/842363.JPG\" style=\"\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span class=\"caption\"&gt;School Room Pillar WI5&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;div align=\"center\" class=\"image\" style=\"width: 139px;\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"/setting-up-the-anchor/605224\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"setting up the anchor\" height=\"200\" width=\"133\" src=\"/images/small/605224.jpg\" style=\"\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span class=\"caption\"&gt;Anchors School Rm&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/noformat&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_10\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Alcove&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div&gt;Just downstream from School Room is the&lt;b&gt;&lt;u&gt; Alcove&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/b&gt; offering more difficult climbing and less crowds. It is also home to some of the finest mixed climbs in the Ice Park. On the downstream end, the Alcove ends and the entry into the Upper Bridge area is blocked by a small waterfall and large boulders. You can walk freely between School Room area and the Alcove, and you access the Alcove area via the same ladder as the School Room area. The upper section (closer to School Room) area has several moderate ice climbs that can easily be top roped. The lower section of the gorge is more difficult to top rope and most climbs are lead (they are some nice overhanging mixed routes there). &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;There are 14 routes ranging from WI3 to WI4 and mixed climbs ranging from M4 to M8.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;noformat&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;table border=\"1\" cellpadding bgcolor=\"lightgrey\"&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;div align=\"center\" class=\"image\" style=\"width: 206px;\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"/checking-in-to-the-alcove/699269\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Checking in to the Alcove\" height=\"151\" width=\"200\" src=\"/images/small/699269.jpg\" style=\"\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span class=\"caption\"&gt;SKI in Alcove area&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;div align=\"center\" class=\"image\" style=\"width: 139px;\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"/alcove-area/766107\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Alcove area\" height=\"200\" width=\"133\" src=\"/images/small/766107.jpg\" style=\"\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span class=\"caption\"&gt;Alcove area&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;div align=\"center\" class=\"image\" style=\"width: 139px;\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view-into-the-school-room/834483\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"View into the School Room\" height=\"200\" width=\"133\" src=\"/images/small/834483.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span class=\"caption\"&gt;School from Alcove&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;div align=\"center\" class=\"image\" style=\"width: 139px;\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"/alcove/699723\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Alcove\" height=\"200\" width=\"133\" src=\"/images/small/699723.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span class=\"caption\"&gt;Alcove from School&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;div align=\"center\" class=\"image\" style=\"width: 139px;\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"/easter-rising-m8/842368\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Easter Rising M8\" height=\"200\" width=\"133\" src=\"/images/small/842368.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span class=\"caption\"&gt;Easter Rising M8&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;div align=\"center\" class=\"image\" style=\"width: 139px;\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"/flamenco-wi4/842367\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Flamenco WI4\" height=\"200\" width=\"133\" src=\"/images/small/842367.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span class=\"caption\"&gt;Flamenco WI4&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/noformat&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_11\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Upper Bridge&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;u&gt;The Upper Bridge&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/b&gt; hosts some of the most steep and longest climbs in the gorge. Viewers can follow progress of climbers from the Upper Bridge. There are no easy routes there, and there is no walk off! Make sure you can climb up. The climbs adjacent to the bridge and underneath it are reserved for lead climbing only. This area is well marked and should not be used for top roping. All climbs are long (roughly 40 meters), and best suited to belay from the top. Most routes here either anchor to a tree or to one of the many large, steel posts in the ground designated as an anchor (these posts do not look like much, but do hold). It is cold inside the gorge here, narrow and dark. &lt;span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;There are about 24 routes here ranging from WI4 to WI6, and M7-M9. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;noformat&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;table border=\"1\" cellpaddign=\"3\" bgcolor=\"lightgrey\"&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;div align=\"center\" class=\"image\" style=\"width: 206px;\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"/entry-to-ice-park/606876\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Entry to Ice Park\" height=\"133\" width=\"200\" src=\"/images/small/606876.jpg\" style=\"\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span class=\"caption\"&gt;Upper Bridge climbs&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;div align=\"center\" class=\"image\" style=\"width: 156px;\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"/february-11-2005-looking/97709\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"February 11, 2005 - Looking...\" height=\"200\" width=\"150\" src=\"/images/small/97709.jpg\" style=\"\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span class=\"caption\"&gt;PellucidWombat looking into Upper Bridge&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;div align=\"center\" class=\"image\" style=\"width: 139px;\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"/the-lower-and-upper-bridge-area/833116\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"The Lower and Upper Bridge area\" height=\"200\" width=\"133\" src=\"/images/small/833116.jpg\" style=\"\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span class=\"caption\"&gt;Both Bridges- lower and upper&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;div align=\"center\" class=\"image\" style=\"width: 156px;\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"/will-gadd-on-pic-of-the-vic/589237\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Will Gadd on Pic of the Vic\" height=\"200\" width=\"150\" src=\"/images/small/589237.jpg\" style=\"\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span class=\"caption\"&gt;Pic O\'the Vic WI4&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;div align=\"center\" class=\"image\" style=\"width: 206px;\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"/upper-bridge-climbs/480990\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Upper Bridge Climbs\" height=\"150\" width=\"200\" src=\"/images/small/480990.jpg\" style=\"\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span class=\"caption\"&gt;Upper Bridge Climbs&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/noformat&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_12\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Kids Climbing Wall&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div align=\"center\" class=\"image-left\" style=\"width: 206px; \"&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=842370\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/medium/842370.JPG\" alt=\"Kids Wall\" style=\"width: 200px; height: 133.20000000000002px; \"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=\"caption\"&gt;Kids Climbing Wall at Ouray Ice Park.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div align=\"center\" class=\"image-right\" style=\"width: 146px; \"&gt;&lt;a href=\"/view_object.php?object_id=606877\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"/images/medium/606877.jpg\" alt=\"Memorial\" style=\"width: 140px; height: 210px; \"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=\"caption\"&gt;Memorial to fallen friends&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;The &lt;b&gt;&lt;u&gt;Kid\'s Climbing Wall&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/b&gt; is not inside the gorge, and is located just by Upper Bridge area, off Camp Bird Road. It is a beginner climbing area that was created by money donated during the 2007 Ouray Ice Festival in memory of fallen female alpinists Sue Nott and Karen McNeil who were lost on Mount Foraker after summiting in May 2006 and other fallen friends of Ouray Ice Park. It was designated with the goal of bringing young climbers into the sport. Although adults are allowed access to this area, please give priority to children. The routes are about 20 meter long, mostly WI2s, and there is an walk up path for top roping. It is easily accessible for non-climbers (parents can watch closely). &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;This is the only wall in the park I have not climbed on. They provide free instructions here for children during the Ice Festival. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;There are 9 routes, all rated as WI2.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_13\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Lower Bridge&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;u&gt;The Lower Bridge area&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/b&gt; is as the names says located just below the Lower Bridge. (This bridge is closed to traffic, you can drive over the upper bridge, which provides access to climbs in Camp Bird area). The Lower Bridge area has a very short approach, and there is a walk-down path near the Lower Bridge viewing stand that is equipped with a hand line. On the west side of the bridge is an old, stone building with a rounded roof and a faded mural painted on the side. It is called the Powderhouse and formerly housed explosive powder for area mines. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;The gorge is quiet narrow underneath this bridge. The climbs near here have a more confining and isolated feel. This area is used for competitions during the Ice Festival, and there are numerous mixed climbs here. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;The Lower Bridge area features 18 routes, ranging from WI3 to WI5 and M6 to M9. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;noformat&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;table border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"3\" bgcolor=\"lightgrey\"&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;div align=\"center\" class=\"image\" style=\"width: 138px;\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"/detailed-mixed-climbing/835079\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Detailed mixed climbing\" height=\"200\" width=\"132\" src=\"/images/small/835079.jpg\" style=\"\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span class=\"caption\"&gt;Mighty Aphrodite M9&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;div align=\"center\" class=\"image\" style=\"width: 133.68px; \"&gt;&lt;a href=\"/culminator-wi5/698442\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Culminator WI5\" height=\"200\" width=\"133\" src=\"/images/small/698442.jpg\" style=\"width: 127.68px; height: 192px; \"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span class=\"caption\"&gt;Culminator WI5&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;div align=\"center\" class=\"image\" style=\"width: 156px;\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"/culminator-wi4-5/180005\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Culminator WI4/5\" height=\"200\" width=\"150\" src=\"/images/small/180005.jpg\" style=\"\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span class=\"caption\"&gt;Culminator again&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;div align=\"center\" class=\"image\" style=\"width: 175.5px; \"&gt;&lt;a href=\"/lower-bridge-area/833115\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Lower Bridge area\" height=\"133\" width=\"200\" src=\"/images/small/833115.JPG\" style=\"width: 169.5px; height: 113px; \"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span class=\"caption\"&gt;2007 Qualifying Route&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;div align=\"center\" class=\"image\" style=\"width: 206px;\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"/pemba-sherpa-at-ouray/180309\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Pemba Sherpa at Ouray\" height=\"133\" width=\"200\" src=\"/images/small/180309.jpg\" style=\"\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span class=\"caption\"&gt;Pemba Sherpa&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;div align=\"center\" class=\"image\" style=\"width: 206px;\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"/lower-bridge-area/833125\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Lower Bridge Area\" height=\"133\" width=\"200\" src=\"/images/small/833125.JPG\" style=\"\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span class=\"caption\"&gt;Lower Bridge area&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/noformat&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_14\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Scottish Gullies&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div&gt;The &lt;b&gt;&lt;u&gt;Scottish Gullies&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/b&gt; area is named after two prominent gullies - By Gully and Ach Mon, and includes surrounding climbs. The Lower Bridge area gradually goes into Scottish Gullies, and both areas use the same descent path. The Scottish Gullies has something for everyone. It is a great place for total beginners, intermediates, looking to practice leading or top roping, and for experts looking for good, challenging mixed climbs. Most routes are about 25 to 30 meters long.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;There are numerous mixes routes there, including the most popular one in the Ice Park: Tic Tac. An easy walk-down descent path with a hand line is located opposite the climbs on the East side of the gorge, just below the Lower Bridge viewing platform. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;There are 23 routes here ranging from WI2 to WI5, and M5-M9.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;noformat&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;table border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"3\" bgcolor=\"lightgrey\"&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;div align=\"center\" class=\"image\" style=\"width: 139px;\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"/scottish-gullies/699721\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Scottish Gullies\" height=\"200\" width=\"133\" src=\"/images/small/699721.jpg\" style=\"\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span class=\"caption\"&gt;Scottish Gullies&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;div align=\"center\" class=\"image\" style=\"width: 206px;\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"/dizzy-curtain-wi4/833118\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Dizzy Curtain WI4\" height=\"133\" width=\"200\" src=\"/images/small/833118.JPG\" style=\"\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span class=\"caption\"&gt;Dizzy Curtain WI4&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;div align=\"center\" class=\"image\" style=\"width: 156px;\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"/ach-mon-wi4/841081\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Ach Mon WI4\" height=\"200\" width=\"150\" src=\"/images/small/841081.JPG\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span class=\"caption\"&gt;Ach Mon WI4&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;div align=\"center\" class=\"image\" style=\"width: 206px;\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"/popstar/696914\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Popstar\" height=\"150\" width=\"200\" src=\"/images/small/696914.JPG\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span class=\"caption\"&gt;Popstar WI3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;div align=\"center\" class=\"image\" style=\"width: 139px;\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"/action-in-the-park/833126\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Action in the park\" height=\"200\" width=\"133\" src=\"/images/small/833126.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span class=\"caption\"&gt;Le Saucisson and Ach Mon&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;div align=\"center\" class=\"image\" style=\"width: 206px;\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"/scottish-gullies/697131\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Scottish gullies\" height=\"150\" width=\"200\" src=\"/images/small/697131.jpg\" style=\"\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span class=\"caption\"&gt;Popstar WI3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;div align=\"center\" class=\"image\" style=\"width: 139px;\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"/by-gully/842373\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"By Gully\" height=\"200\" width=\"133\" src=\"/images/small/842373.jpg\" style=\"\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span class=\"caption\"&gt;By Gully early season&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;div align=\"center\" class=\"image\" style=\"width: 206px;\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"/dizzy-curtain-and-aye-laddy/833120\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Dizzy Curtain and Aye Laddy!!\" height=\"133\" width=\"200\" src=\"/images/small/833120.JPG\" style=\"\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span class=\"caption\"&gt;Dizzy Curtain and Aye Laddy!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;div align=\"center\" class=\"image\" style=\"width: 139px;\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"/tic-tac-m6/833124\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Tic Tac M6\" height=\"200\" width=\"133\" src=\"/images/small/833124.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span class=\"caption\"&gt;Tic Tac M6&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;div align=\"center\" class=\"image\" style=\"width: 206px;\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"/anchors/697133\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"anchors\" height=\"150\" width=\"200\" src=\"/images/small/697133.jpg\" style=\"\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span class=\"caption\"&gt;Oranged flagged anchors&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/noformat&gt;                                                               &lt;a name=\"chapter_15\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Five Fingers&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div&gt;The&lt;b&gt;&lt;u&gt; Fiver Fingers area&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/b&gt; is located further downstream of the Lower Bridge and past Scottish Gullies. It is closer to town, and if you plan to climb over there, it is probably easier to walk from town rather than to park. It is easily visible from the large switchback on Hwy 550 when driving to the Ice Park. It appears like several distinct columns - fingers of ice, but I think there are 6 or 7, instead of 5. Most of the climbs are steep, and suited for intermediate to advanced climbers. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;All the climbs are located below the service road and the anchors are chains extending from bolts in the rock wall on the opposite side of the road from the ice (vehicle would drive over these chains). The chains are long enough to reach across the road, so don\'t belay or leave your gear right on the road as other visitors and climbers need to access this road. The routes are 35 to 40 meters long, and most people belay from the road. There is a walk down descent path equipped with a hand line in the gully located just below the picnic area where the wall turns sharply to the East. Look for the ladder over the fence. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;There are 12 routes here, ranging from WI4 to WI5, and M7.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;noformat&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;table border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"3\" bgcolor=\"lightgrey\"&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;div align=\"center\" class=\"image\" style=\"width: 206px;\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"/five-fingers-area/696911\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Five Fingers area\" height=\"150\" width=\"200\" src=\"/images/small/696911.JPG\" style=\"\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span class=\"caption\"&gt;We are #1 WI4&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;div align=\"center\" class=\"image\" style=\"width: 156px;\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"/the-fingers-part-ii/253390\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"The Fingers part II\" height=\"200\" width=\"150\" src=\"/images/small/253390.jpg\" style=\"\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span class=\"caption\"&gt;Ice columns at Fingers area&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;div align=\"center\" class=\"image\" style=\"width: 206px;\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"/five-fingers-area/838494\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Five Fingers area\" height=\"133\" width=\"200\" src=\"/images/small/838494.JPG\" style=\"\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span class=\"caption\"&gt;Playing Hooky and We are #1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;div align=\"center\" class=\"image\" style=\"width: 156px;\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"/five-fingers-area/696908\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Five Fingers area\" height=\"200\" width=\"150\" src=\"/images/small/696908.JPG\" style=\"cursor: nw-resize; \"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span class=\"caption\"&gt;Five Fingers area&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;div align=\"center\" class=\"image\" style=\"width: 156px;\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"/the-fingers-part-i/253387\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"The Fingers part I\" height=\"200\" width=\"150\" src=\"/images/small/253387.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span class=\"caption\"&gt;Fingers by Flex&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/noformat&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_16\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Shithouse and Gazebo Wall&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;u&gt;The Shithouse and Gazebo Wall&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/b&gt; are the furthest downstream, closest to town. If you choose to climb here, it is definitively easier just to walk in from the end of 3rd Avenue (near Victorian Inn and Box Canyon Lodge) rather than driving. &lt;br&gt;The sunny Shithouse is named for the brick outhouse located right above the climbs and next to the open picnic area at the top. The climbs can melt out if it has been warm, so be careful to check conditions before venturing out there. The climbs here are similar to Five Fingers area but are a bit more moderate. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;u&gt;The Gazebo Wall&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/b&gt; is just downstream next to Shithouse Wall and right below the covered picnic gazebo at the canyon\'s rim. Like the Shithouse Wall, this area also gets a lot of sun and the climbs can melt out. There is a walk down descent path equipped with hand lines in between Five Fingers and the Shithouse Wall in a gully.

Shasta.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;I&rsquo;ve attempted to find fault with myself in hopes of learning for the future, but after much reflection and research, I have yet to find any &lsquo;mistakes&rsquo; we made that could have been foreseen as such, which is why I\'ve chosen to continue climbing and am doing so with a clean conscience. It&rsquo;s much easier to judge than to understand, it&rsquo;s easier to spout vitriol than to sympathize, hindsight is 20/20, and I could care less about pandering to those who choose to take these easy attitudes at the expense of other people.  So this article is not for them. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div align=\"center\" class=\"image\" style=\"width: 506px;\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"/mt-foraker-sunset-at-17k/475857\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Mt Foraker Sunset at 17k\" height=\"332\" width=\"500\" src=\"/images/medium/475857.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=\"caption\"&gt;Mt. Foraker Sunset at 17,000 ft.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Alpinism is inherently dangerous, but that doesn\'t mean that it is &lt;i&gt;always&lt;/i&gt; so. Much of alpinism is about training and strategizing to mitigate risk to the level where one can go into the mountains to commune with nature, test himself, &lt;i&gt;and&lt;/i&gt; return safely. During my time climbing I haven\'t met many (if any) adrenaline junkies. They usually don\'t last, either due to the hazard or due to the effort and diligence required to reap the real rewards of alpinism. As the saying goes for inherently risky activities, \"there are old climbers and there are bold climbers, but there are no old bold climbers.\" Serious mountaineering for the long-term requires sustained education, practice, commitment, and incredibly hard work.  This is one of the aspects that draw me to climbing.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div align=\"center\" class=\"image\" style=\"width: 506px;\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"/drytooling-above-berkeley/607556\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Drytooling above Berkeley\" height=\"253\" width=\"500\" src=\"/images/medium/607556.JPG\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=\"caption\"&gt;Practicing dry-tooling in the San Francisco Bay Area, far from the mountains.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Tom and I climbed mountains in the winter despite the increase in risk for the increased challenge and experience, both for the enjoyment of the challenge and also as training so that we could more safely attempt harder and more serious climbs on other peaks in other parts of the world. Although we enjoyed the physical, technical, and intellectual challenges of alpinism, that is only one part of it, despite the clich&eacute; that seems to be most prominent in the public imagination. I want to emphasize some of the more personal reasons as well, as for me they are what make it worth taking on the risk.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div align=\"center\" class=\"image\" style=\"width: 334px;\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"/rime-on-sargents-ridge/598673\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Rime on Sargents Ridge\" height=\"500\" width=\"328\" src=\"/images/medium/598673.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=\"caption\"&gt;Ice forms that you don\'t see unless you venture into the high mountains in the middle of winter. Tom and I enjoyed these together on Sargents Ridge in January.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;One is &lt;i&gt;partnership&lt;/i&gt;. I&rsquo;ve forged intensely strong partnerships with my climbing partners through shared experiences, dedication, risk, and trusting our lives to one another. This &lt;i&gt;&ldquo;Brotherhood of the Rope&rdquo;&lt;/i&gt; is a unique bond that I have been unable to find in any other type of relationship.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div align=\"center\" class=\"image\" style=\"width: 338px;\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"/wind-scoured-snow-on-the-bolam-glacier/618757\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Wind Scoured Snow on the Bolam Glacier\" height=\"500\" width=\"332\" src=\"/images/medium/618757.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=\"caption\"&gt;Windscoured snow that Tom and I appreciated together on the Bolam Glacier.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Another reason I climb, which Tom shared, was our &lt;i&gt;love for nature&lt;/i&gt;. I&rsquo;m not religious, but I do find spirituality in the mountains, and I find bliss and wonder in these extreme environments. In some ways the word &lsquo;extreme&rsquo; is crucial because it keeps me humble before the raw power of nature. Seeing the immense scale of the glaciers and mountains in Alaska was the first time that I could ever begin to appreciate the idea of infinity.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div align=\"center\" class=\"image\" style=\"width: 506px;\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"/ice-in-the-2nd-icefall-on-the-whitney-glacier/618800\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Ice in the 2nd Icefall on the Whitney Glacier\" height=\"332\" width=\"500\" src=\"/images/medium/618800.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=\"caption\"&gt;Modern art found in the Whitney Glacier.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Even the smallest of details in nature can be incredibly beautiful, and I often delight in discovering striking forms in the world of ice and snow. I love the beauty found in features such as the patterns of wind-scoured snow, color and texture of glacial ice, or the bizarre formations of rime ice. Even for the rare mountain traveler in winter, these can easily be missed. Taking the time to stop and appreciate these subtle wonders of the mountains was a trait that I shared with Tom, and it made us closer in our experiences in the mountains together. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div align=\"center\" class=\"image\" style=\"width: 506px;\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"/snow-form/475758\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Snow Form\" height=\"347\" width=\"500\" src=\"/images/medium/475758.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=\"caption\"&gt;Beauty of Winter Climbing.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Winter is an especially appealing time for me to venture into the mountains despite the greater risk and discomfort &ndash; to me, the winter landscape in the high mountains is ethereal.  For those that ask why I venture into the mountains, if they had ever experienced the fiery red and orange Alpenglow on expansive snow slopes or white granite palisades, or if they had ever experienced the deep blue glow of the moon on icy snow slopes with no sound but for the crunch of one&rsquo;s footsteps, they wouldn&rsquo;t have to ask.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div align=\"center\" class=\"image\" style=\"width: 506px;\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"/wind-scoured-snow-near-the-bolam-glacier/618738\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Wind Scoured Snow Near the Bolam Glacier\" height=\"356\" width=\"500\" src=\"/images/medium/618738.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=\"caption\"&gt;Wind-scoured snow that Tom and I traveled across on the north side of Mt Shasta in March.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Regarding taking on increased risk for mountaineering, there is also something to be said about taking on more risk. Many people are reticent of the idea, yet people do it all the time whether they realize it or not. Yes, mountaineering can lead to my injury or death in a variety of ways, but my choice to drive also heightens this risk. So does choosing to get around by bicycle in an urban area such as the San Francisco Bay Area. I have had many close calls on my bicycle and I nearly died once on a trip to Mt. Shasta, not on the climb, but on the drive home when someone came barreling down the I-5 against my direction of traffic, straddling both lanes. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;People choose to live in flood-prone, hurricane-prone, and earthquake-prone areas with little thought given as to the real risk and whether it is worth it. Why is climbing perceived to be so much more dangerous than other activities?  Perhaps one is that in many aspects of our lives we take on risk out of convenience (driving, eating poorly, talking on cell phones in dangerous situations, etc.) while in climbing the risk is taken on with active effort. Maybe another reason is that the risk in climbing is much more salient, so it is harder to ignore.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;table&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;div align=\"center\" class=\"image\" style=\"width: 156px;\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"/sargents-traverse/598593\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Sargents Traverse\" height=\"200\" width=\"150\" src=\"/images/small/598593.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=\"caption\"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;vs.&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;img class=\"alignleft size-full wp-image-32\" title=\"cartexting\" src=\"http://www.connect2mersenne.net/330_blog/digital/Joelle/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/cartexting.jpg\" alt=\"cartexting\" width=\"252\" height=\"193\"&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;b&gt;Which form of risk is more reasonable to you? At least Guy is paying attention to what he is doing, and he can only hurt himself here. Yet why does no one bother asking \"Why do you text and drive?\" and \"Is it worth it?\"&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So my point is that you cannot avoid risk, you can only try to be aware and decide what risks are worth the benefits. While it may seem shallow to say climbing is worth the risk for the reasons that I hold, I&rsquo;d sure rather have my demise be climbing in the mountains than being run over on my way to work.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div align=\"center\" class=\"image\" style=\"width: 506px;\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"/kahiltna-pass/475840\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Kahiltna Pass\" height=\"328\" width=\"500\" src=\"/images/medium/475840.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=\"caption\"&gt;Sunset at Kahiltna Pass on Denali.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As sad and traumatic as my experience was on Mount Shasta, I intend to continue climbing. I know Tom would want nothing less. This tragedy was the result of incredibly bad luck with a rare and serious development of HACE. Coming off the mountain as well as I did was testament to how well prepared I was, and Tom was equally well prepared. Even in ideal conditions I don&rsquo;t think the outcome would have been different, so I can only view this experience as a part of life, but not something to run from. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div align=\"center\" class=\"image\" style=\"width: 361px;\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"/tom-bennett/612631\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Tom Bennett\" height=\"500\" width=\"355\" src=\"/images/medium/612631.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=\"caption\"&gt;Tom Bennett, living life to its fullest inside a Giant Sequoia.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In closing, I want to share a similar sentiment about climbing that one of Tom&rsquo;s closest friends shared with me after Tom&rsquo;s death.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;'),(300,624046,'/reflections-and-lessons-from-mt-shasta/624046','/against-all-hope-life-partnership-and-loss-on-mt-shasta/626323','Reflections and Lessons from Mt.

Shasta tragedy in hopes that others can take away some valuable lessons, or offer further insight. Much of this has come from personal reflection, discussion with &lt;i&gt;MANY&lt;/i&gt; people, and additional research into the topics, both for my peace of mind and in an attempt to understand and learn.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I&rsquo;ve attempted to find fault with myself in hopes of learning for the future, but after much reflection and research, I have yet to find any &lsquo;mistakes&rsquo; we made that could have been foreseen as such, which is why I\'ve chosen to continue climbing and am doing so with a clean conscience. It&rsquo;s much easier to judge than to understand, it&rsquo;s easier to spout vitriol than to sympathize, hindsight is 20/20, and I could care less about pandering to those who choose to take these easy attitudes at the expense of other people.  So this article is not for them. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There are lessons to be learned, though, and I&rsquo;m writing about them in the spirit of education and safety that Tom and I shared. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div align=\"center\" class=\"image\" style=\"width: 506px;\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"/tom-bennett/612623\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Tom Bennett\" height=\"375\" width=\"500\" src=\"/images/medium/612623.JPG\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=\"caption\"&gt;Tom practicing construction of a V-Thread anchor.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_2\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Altitude Illness&lt;/h2&gt;There wasn&rsquo;t much for me to learn here, as later research revealed that I did everything right and had a full awareness of what was happening and what to do. Still, many people have asked me about the &lsquo;what ifs&rsquo; for Tom&rsquo;s HACE and whether any actions could prevent such an outcome in the future. Sadly, my answer would be a resounding &ldquo;no&rdquo;, but I&rsquo;ll address the points here.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For those that aren&rsquo;t familiar with high altitude ailments such as High Altitude Pulmonary Edema (HAPE) or High Altitude Cerebral Edema (HACE), &lt;a href=\"http://www.altitude.org/altitude_sickness.php\"&gt;Altitude.org&lt;/a&gt; has a good summary.&lt;br&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_3\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h3&gt;HACE Prevention &lt;/h3&gt;&lt;br&gt;HACE can occur at elevations as low as 6,500 ft, only 1% of people who ascend above 9,000 ft get HACE, and the vast majority of those cases occur above 16,000 ft. It is almost always preceded by symptoms of Acute Mountain Sickness (AMS). Tom never reported any symptoms and I never saw any expressed. By Tom&rsquo;s reports and behavior, he showed signs of acclimatizing. If there were any signs, they developed overnight and were subtle enough that Tom couldn&rsquo;t feel anything wrong until he stood up. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Over-hydration can be a cause of HACE, but although Tom hydrated a lot on Saturday, by Sunday morning he was more likely to be mildly dehydrated.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The probability of Tom developing HACE at 14,000 ft was extremely small, especially considering that the previous two days we slept at 5,000 ft &amp;amp; 10,000 ft, and had ascended to nearly 14,000 ft or higher twice. He had been getting up high regularly the past few months and never showed any susceptibility to altitude. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;About all that can be learned here is that even those who don&rsquo;t appear to suffer from altitude can still develop HACE, people that seem to perform well at altitude can still develop HACE at moderately high altitudes, and that one is never completely safe from this sickness when entering the mountains.&lt;br&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_4\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h3&gt;HACE Treatment &lt;/h3&gt;&lt;br&gt;The only permanent treatment for HACE is immediate descent. That is why instead of calling 911 immediately, I attempted to get Tom down until it was evident that this was impossible to do. He was so far gone that even in good weather, without a sled it would have required a team of people to carry him down.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There are three treatments that can aid in descent while suffering from HACE that people have asked me about. One is administering oxygen directly, another is the hyperbaric or Gamow &lt;i&gt;(pronounced &lsquo;gamov&rsquo;)&lt;/i&gt; bag, which simulates lower altitude, and still another is administering an injection of dexamethasone. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;First, for both of these I&rsquo;d have to say that the winds blowing over Avalanche Gulch were so strong, and the rest of our descent options technical enough, that I doubt either of these could have improved Tom&rsquo;s condition well enough for him to descend.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Gamow bags are large enough, expensive enough, and heavy enough that only expeditions to the high altitudes of the Andes and Himalayas can justify bringing them. Similarly for bottled oxygen, so carrying such things to the summit of Mt. Shasta is impractical and unrealistic considering how unlikely the need is compared to other first-aid needs.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Dexamethasone is the only thing that one could feasibly carry to Mt. Shasta&rsquo;s summit, but it is not necessarily a viable solution.  It requires a prescription and not everyone can get it. For example, I tried to get some for myself when I was procuring prescription drugs for altitude ailments from physicians for my climb to the summit of Denali (Mt. McKinley), the highest summit of North America where HACE and HAPE are common. Though I could get some prescription drugs, I was unable to get this drug from my doctor for 20,320&rsquo; Denali, so I suspect that many people could not get it for 14,162&rsquo; Mt. Shasta.&lt;a name=\"chapter_5\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Mountain Search-and-Rescue Calls&lt;/h2&gt;During this ordeal, I saw a number of problems with communicating important details to Mountain Search-and-Rescue (MSAR) that resulted from both ends of the phone line. Making a call for a rescue and communicating vital information seems simple enough, but in reality there are a number of factors that make this very difficult to achieve, thereby delaying rescue and increasing confusion in rescue attempts.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I want to emphasize, though, that none of these improvements to my communication with 911 &amp;amp; SAR would have changed the outcome on Mt. Shasta.&lt;br&gt;When making a call for an MSAR, a few factors may make it difficult to properly get across the necessary information to those on the ground who are knowledgeable about the mountain and can make use of it:&lt;br&gt;&lt;ul type=\"&rdquo;disc&rdquo;\"&gt;&lt;li&gt;Low battery power.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;li&gt;Bad reception (and an inability to know what the operator could actually make out from your garbled call). &lt;/li&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;li&gt;Short periods of reception. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;li&gt;Transferring details from 911 to SAR to the field commander to the climbing rangers. It seemed to me that some details that were important were not delivered to the rangers because they were given trimmed down information from people higher up in command who didn&rsquo;t know the mountain as well or what information was important. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In light of these problems and after talking with others about them, I&rsquo;ve boiled down some possible solutions unique to calling in an MSAR that could be useful individually or in combination:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_6\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Personal Locator Beacons (PLB)&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Purpose:&lt;/b&gt; Communicating your exact position and requesting a rescue to that location.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Pros:&lt;/b&gt; Unit is left off until needed. Message is sent out quickly, with no garbled transmission, and the location can be seen on a digital map such as Google Maps or entered into a GPS unit. Vital information for locating the rescue location is directly communicated to the rescuers without need for knowledge of the area. There is no need for cell phone reception as the units use satellite reception and are as such more reliable in getting a message out. The units are about as small and light as an avalanche beacon and are inexpensive, with the main cost being the annual subscription to the service provider. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Cons:&lt;/b&gt; Cannot specify the needs of the rescue call or the urgency of the rescue. Cannot receive instructions from rescuers. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Comments:&lt;/b&gt;  In the case of Mt. Shasta, I had one on the mountain for sending position locations to family and friends for fun. I left it in the tent, but in the long run this oversight was inconsequential. The only way a PLB would have been helpful here was that if I didn&rsquo;t make it off the mountain alive, rescuers could at least locate Tom&rsquo;s body, and if I perished on the descent, they might have been able to locate my body if I sent out another distress signal from my final location. Still, in light of the difficulties in communicating our position to 911, I\'ll be more likely to carry one with me in the future.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;table&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src=\"http://lh4.ggpht.com/_or_7Q5ytcj4/S_ufacGTgoI/AAAAAAAAA9s/h-CFfm6kuD0/s512/DSC_0398-a.jpg\" align=\"&rdquo;center&rdquo;\" width=\"240\"&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;b&gt;SPOT is a small, lightweight, and easy to use personal locator beacon.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_7\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Texting &lt;/h3&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Purpose:&lt;/b&gt; Getting information across intact when the phone is low on battery power or reception is a problem. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Pros:&lt;/b&gt; Requires less battery power to write and send a message. You are more likely to get out a text message than to get a call connection, and you need less time to send the message so are less likely to get cut off. The information won&rsquo;t come through garbled. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Cons:&lt;/b&gt; 911 and MSAR probably isn&rsquo;t set up to receive these sort of calls in many areas. With regular cell phones, texting a message takes a while so back-and-forth communication would be difficult in extreme environments. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Comments:&lt;/b&gt; This could be an excellent way to get out a &lsquo;first&rsquo; call, with location, names, rescue needs and urgency. I&rsquo;ve found texting to be more reliable than phone calls in brief communications with climbing partners in the mountains. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src=\"http://lh3.ggpht.com/_or_7Q5ytcj4/S_udHmFJQKI/AAAAAAAAA9I/ZWRs6lAIiNg/s512/DSC_0408-a.jpg\" width=\"240\"&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_8\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Emergency Contact as an Agent &lt;/h3&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Purpose:&lt;/b&gt; To have someone pre-briefed such that they can act in your behalf in making an MSAR call. You call them with the most pertinent information and let them call the local MSAR to provide most of the rest of the information. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Pros:&lt;/b&gt; The person already knows your itinerary, ascent route, car location, name of party members, and possibly even the area based on a pre-trip briefing. All that you need to do when calling in a rescue through them is to tell them your location (which they should be able to make sense of easily since they are familiar with your route), and needs specific to the rescue. They can provide MSAR with your phone number if they want to attempt to talk with you directly, but this is less critical than if you&rsquo;re the only one calling in. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Cons:&lt;/b&gt; Hard to see any except there is a 3rd person involved in the communication. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_9\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Agent (Digital Style) &lt;/h3&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Purpose:&lt;/b&gt; Same as the regular &ldquo;agent&rdquo; solution except your contact can provide MSAR directly with your itinerary in written and map form. If your emergency contact has digital copies of your route itinerary and map, they can deliver these directly to MSAR. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Pros:&lt;/b&gt; MSAR has much better information about your whereabouts and kicks the pants off of any wilderness permit used for such rescues. Rescuers can have a map showing your exact intended routes and camps, in addition to any other trip information that you left with your emergency contact. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Cons:&lt;/b&gt; There is no system set up for this to my knowledge, so you&rsquo;d need to do some work ahead of time, such as finding out where to send the information, and how to make sure it is received. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Comments:&lt;/b&gt; I shared a typed itinerary and annotated map of our travel plans with friends via Google Docs, which was easily shared by e-mailing a link. Once my community of friends became aware of Tom\'s plight, someone thought to attempt to e-mail this to the local authorities. It never got anywhere, but it could have been useful to the rescuers if it had. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;table&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src=\"http://lh4.ggpht.com/_or_7Q5ytcj4/S_ufoT9fLUI/AAAAAAAAA90/7gcEdEfNzYw/s800/Digital%20Agent.jpg\" width=\"640\"&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;b&gt; A Google Docs folder, which can be used to easily share maps and itineraries amongst many people. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_10\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Electronics and Cold Weather&lt;/h2&gt;One thing that greatly hampered communication was my cell phone running out of batteries. Although I had charged the batteries just before the trip, temperatures were cold enough that even with the phone stored inside my pack, temperatures left me with only a few minutes worth of battery life. However, I was able to milk juice from the battery throughout the next two days by storing the phone inside my jacket, warming it with body heat.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Cell phone batteries can behave drastically different in the cold (e.g. Tom\'s I-Phone never had battery problems, but it had reception issues), so for cold winter climbs either make sure you know at about what temperatures it keeps power when stored inside your pack, or keep it inside your clothes if you want the batteries fresh and ready for an emergency call.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Also, my altimeter stopped working on my descent on account of the cold and rime build-up, leaving me with only a map and compass to navigate. This is an example where I would have been in big trouble if I were &lt;i&gt;dependent&lt;/i&gt; on a GPS.&lt;a name=\"chapter_11\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Unknown Unknowables and Wind on Mt. Shasta&lt;/h2&gt;When dealing with risk, it is helpful to break down some of the hazards into the categories of: &lt;br&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Known knowables&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;li&gt;Known unknowables&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;li&gt;Unknown knowables&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;li&gt;Unknown unknowables&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br&gt;These are common labels used in risk assessment, and I&rsquo;ve incorporated much of what I have learned in risk assessment and crisis management to climbing:  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Known knowables&lt;/b&gt; are things such as what one learns from an avalanche safety course. For example, slopes that can potentially slide, and whether you are on or beneath one. These tend to be factors in accidents when people ignore warning signs as they are rushed to get down, focused on the summit, overconfident, etc.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Known unknowables&lt;/b&gt; are things that one can never know, but they can at least be aware of them. For example, where the trigger points are for an avalanche. These play into one&rsquo;s uncertainty in assessing risk.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Unknown knowables&lt;/b&gt; are bad, as these are basically things you could have known, had you taken the time to investigate and learn. These lead to &lt;i&gt;preventable&lt;/i&gt; accidents. Reactive approaches to preventing future accidents also deal with these.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Unknown unknowables&lt;/b&gt; are things that one can never know that the one is unaware of. These are often things that become known only through a creatively morbid imagination, a near-miss, or an accident, and these are a common source of accidents.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In retrospect, I&rsquo;ve learned some things about the wind on Mt. Shasta, turning some unknowns into knowns for me, which I&rsquo;ll elaborate on here.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_12\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Weather Forecasts&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;br&gt;Apparently, the NOAA forecast, when predicting winds, uses models for predicting typical surface winds from incoming weather. Mt. Shasta, due to its prominence, and due to the lack of drag in early season when snow coats the mountain, creates much stronger winds and venturi effects, leading to forecasts underestimating wind speeds. It has been suggested that NOAA forecasts for the mountain use wind-speed models for the winds several thousand feet above the ground. So forecasted wind speeds are a much greater unknowable than I had realized.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;(The Thursday forecast that I had last checked forecasted calm to moderate winds on the mountain.)&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I&rsquo;ve long feared bad weather on Mt. Shasta &ndash; especially the wind &ndash; and I treat the mountain with respect. Knowing this detail about the forecasts will cause me to assume greater wind speeds than forecasted, and that such forecasted wind speeds are likely to be much less accurate than even the highly inaccurate general weather forecasts for the mountain. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_13\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Localized Winds&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;br&gt;I figured that high winds on the mountain would be obvious, either in terms of snow plumes, lenticular or lee-wave clouds, or increasing winds as one climbed higher. It never occurred to me that the winds on the mountain could be so localized that you could be in calm weather at one location, only to turn a corner or gain or lose a few dozen feet only to be buffeted by +70 mph winds. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div align=\"center\" class=\"image\" style=\"width: 385px;\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"/mt-shasta-tragedy-day-2-winds/625817\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Mt Shasta Tragedy - Day 2 Winds \" height=\"500\" width=\"379\" src=\"/images/medium/625817.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=\"caption\"&gt;Distribution of winds encountered on day 2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Now I know that despite weather forecasts indicating lower wind speeds, and all signs showing nothing but, that you can still have nasty surprises like this hidden from view &ndash; a particularly nasty known unknowable. Also, beware loose snow, as then it can be difficult to tell the snow plumes from lower-speed winds from the higher-speed winds. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div align=\"center\" class=\"image\" style=\"width: 385px;\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"/mt-shasta-tragedy-day-3-winds/625818\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Mt Shasta Tragedy - Day 3 Winds \" height=\"500\" width=\"379\" src=\"/images/medium/625818.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=\"caption\"&gt;Distribution of winds encountered on day 3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The only takeaway lesson that I see from this is the increased importance on being prepared for adverse weather on the mountain (such as those things listed in the next section), and realizing the greater uncertainty in reading wind signs on the mountain.&lt;a name=\"chapter_14\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What Made the Difference&lt;/h2&gt;One thing worth pointing out from the Mt. Shasta tragedy is that it came out as well as it did. Tom was in a good shelter and quickly found. I made it down alive, and with little more than some mild frostbite and cold injuries to my fingers and toes.  I could have easily developed serious frostbite all over my face and hands, or this easily could have been one of those mountaineering accidents where we both disappeared on the mountain. I didn&rsquo;t think much of my actions at the time, but others have pointed out how unusual or unique some of the important actions were, and that I should point them out for the benefit of other climbers.&lt;br&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_15\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Snow Shovels &amp;amp; Snow Shelters &lt;/h3&gt;&lt;br&gt;How many climbers are proficient at constructing a variety of snow shelters? Especially snow caves? How many of those carry a shovel in situations like a day climb to the summit of Mt. Shasta?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;After talking with a number of climbing friends, the impression I&rsquo;ve gotten is that not a lot of people can answer &lsquo;yes&rsquo; to &lt;i&gt;all&lt;/i&gt; of these questions. Yet, my being proficient at building snowcaves and having the means to do so was critical in the outcome on the mountain.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;table&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src=\"http://lh3.ggpht.com/_or_7Q5ytcj4/S_ugDl-FQ9I/AAAAAAAAA-A/9h-dx84q8KM/s640/Snow%20Cave%20Construction.jpg\" width=\"420\"&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;b&gt;The ideal snow cave &amp;amp; its construction sequence.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Snowcaves are much more difficult to construct in practice than in theory. Finding sufficiently deep snow is difficult, and digging one quickly, without burning out, and without getting drenched, is very difficult. I try to dig at least one snowcave every season, if not more. If I don&rsquo;t find an opportunity on a climbing trip, I make an outing to the mountains specifically to practice this skill (among others). I attribute this &lt;i&gt;regular&lt;/i&gt; practice with my ability to construct two snowcaves in one &lt;i&gt;long day&lt;/i&gt; under very difficult conditions. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If I hadn&rsquo;t tried making snowcaves in such differing conditions, I might not have had the quick-thinking to figure out where to look for a site under the high winds that were scouring most of the snow away. There were very few places from the summit to the base where one could have been constructed, especially in low visibility and with the wind limiting mobility.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;table&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src=\"http://lh4.ggpht.com/_or_7Q5ytcj4/S_udoI0cJKI/AAAAAAAAA9Q/ptich9UPXow/s800/DSC_0405-a.jpg\" width=\"420\"&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;b&gt; Portable snow shovel. A broad, metal blade is best for shoveling large amounts of snow and cutting through hard layers.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br&gt;I often bring a snow shovel to summits that are in exposed areas prone to bad weather precisely for the purpose of being able to construct a snow shelter, and without the shovel, I wouldn&rsquo;t have been able to dig either snowcave. Climbers should consider this use beyond just the extreme conditions that I ended up in. For example, what if you&rsquo;re climbing Mt. Shasta or some other peak that requires a large effort to descend, and someone in your party experiences an injury, such as a broken bone or a tweaked muscle? What if you got lost in the dark coming down? You might have to spend the night, and being able to make a snow shelter would make this much safer.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_16\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Orienteering Skills (without a GPS) &lt;/h3&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;table&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src=\"http://lh3.ggpht.com/_or_7Q5ytcj4/S_ufCc16m-I/AAAAAAAAA9g/8Fs_iZ0ykVw/s800/DSC_0400-b.jpg\" width=\"420\"&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt; &lt;center&gt;&lt;b&gt;Your best navigation friends.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br&gt;Many people like to use GPS devices. While I see the benefit when you need to be very exact in location, such as in locating caches, I emphasize the importance of using a map, compass, and altimeter first. These old-fashioned techniques, though less accurate and less convenient (or more so, depending on your satellite coverage), are much more versatile and robust. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Any climber should be proficient in orienteering and should always have a map, compass, and altimeter with them &lt;i&gt;in addition&lt;/i&gt; to a GPS device.&lt;br&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;table&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src=\"http://lh3.ggpht.com/_or_7Q5ytcj4/S_uemC_rjWI/AAAAAAAAA9Y/PrlCdV7C7rY/s640/DSC_0402-a.jpg\" width=\"240\"&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt; &lt;center&gt;&lt;b&gt;A GPS can be good to have, but it shouldn&rsquo;t be your primary navigation tool.&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br&gt;On my descent, my digital altimeter froze up and died, and if I had a GPS device, it probably would have done the same. What allowed me to stay on route and get myself off the mountain and to rescuers was having a map and compass along, and being proficient at reading them and matching the landscape to the map.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_17\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Knowledge of the Mountain (Beyond the Intended Route) &lt;/h3&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;table&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src=\"http://lh5.ggpht.com/_or_7Q5ytcj4/S_ufxw5mq7I/AAAAAAAAA94/xl11N8oFwvs/s640/Mt%20Shasta%20-%20Knowing%20the%20Terrain.jpg\" width=\"420\"&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;div align=\"center\" class=\"image\" style=\"width: 385px;\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"/mt-shasta-tragedy-descent-routes/625659\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Mt Shasta Tragedy - Descent Routes\" height=\"500\" width=\"379\" src=\"/images/medium/625659.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=\"caption\"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;b&gt;Not knowing the mountain outside your route leaves you with fewer reasonable choices for a backup route.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;b&gt;Routes considered for alternate descents when winds made our planned descent route too dangerous&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br&gt;I knew many of the alternative descent lines besides the Bolam-Whitney Ridge. This gave me options of where to descend with an ability to take the safest and easiest one available. Knowing the mountain well allowed me to pick my way down the mountain and avoid hazards. I would have been much more likely to get lost in such bad visibility if I wasn&rsquo;t so familiar with the mountain. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Even though this was my first visit to the north side of the mountain, I had familiarized myself well enough with the routes and terrain that I had a good mental map of the area. Tom had done the same, so we were able to discuss travel decisions on an equal level.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_18\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Extra Clothing &lt;/h3&gt;&lt;br&gt;Even though the sun was shining, the skies clear, and the weather seemingly better than our first day on the mountain, I brought along my down jacket with a hood, my facemask, my warmest mittens, and liners that I could wear inside of the mittens. Not only did this make bivvying far more pleasant, but it saved me from hypothermia and frostbite. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Considering that the frostbite on my fingers was limited to the tiny area where my liner had come open, I&rsquo;m sure that both my hands would have had terrible frostbite if I didn&rsquo;t have liners to wear when operating my zippers and holding the map, or if I didn&rsquo;t have such warm mittens. The same goes for wearing a facemask.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The blowing wet snow made it impossible to see with my eye protection as it fogged up and streaked with water, but the hood of my jacket provided enough cover that I could still see well enough to navigate in the white-out with my eyes exposed.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_19\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Extra Fitness &lt;/h3&gt;&lt;br&gt;I was not pushing myself to my limit to make the summit. Although I worked myself pretty hard, I&rsquo;ve had enough experience subjecting myself to endurance events that I knew how hard I could push myself while still leaving reserves of energy. For example, although it isn&rsquo;t terribly fun, about once a week I push myself to climb the Stairmaster for an hour, with 10 lb ankle weights and a 60 lb pack, with an aim for punishment and covering as much elevation as I can &ndash; then I go and climb for 2 more hours, sometimes while wearing boots and a 30 lb pack.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I always aim to push myself for power or endurance on my bike rides, runs, and swims, and I try to get out in the mountains as much as possible. When I\'m on easier climbing trips I often carry more weight, including other people\'s gear, as \'training weight\' in order to improve my climbing fitness.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It was extremely physically wearing caring for Tom, digging two snowcaves, and down climbing the full north side of Mt. Shasta in 80-100 mph winds after a long day of climbing, a night out, and insufficient food and water to be hydrated and well-nourished.  Having so much extra fitness, a trained ability to recover quickly, and a good sense of how to pace myself were critical in being able to make it through the weekend.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_20\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Decision Making &lt;/h3&gt;&lt;br&gt;There were a number of ways I dealt with the stress of the situation that made a critical difference in getting down safely and marking Tom&rsquo;s location.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In a nutshell, I&rsquo;d say that my ability to make good decisions under pressure was my ability to maintain good &lt;a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Situation_awareness\"&gt; situational awareness &lt;/a&gt;. I was constantly assessing the situation &ndash; my physical and emotional state (as well as Tom&rsquo;s), the landscape around me, the environment around me, the equipment I had, and the experience I had. I was thinking of relationships between these factors and what decisions to make in light of the full picture.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For example, in being self-aware, as I became more panicked, I managed to acknowledge these feelings, but to not be overwhelmed by them.  I would slow down, calm down, and force myself to think through the problems rather than reacting to them. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Another was my physical state, as I had to decide when to stop. If I had continued down the mountain too far, I easily could have become too exhausted and cold to dig a snowcave. I made sure to get down the mountain far enough  to be reasonably likely to make it out the following day, but once I realized that I was wearing out, I knew that it was time to recover before I was spent.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_21\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Attitude toward Climbing &lt;/h3&gt;&lt;br&gt;I seem to stand apart from my friends in how much I read up on concepts ahead of time, how hard I work to remember the concepts I&rsquo;ve studied, and how much emphasis I give to practice &ndash; not only in climbing techniques, but also in first-aid, wilderness survival, and self-rescue.  This point is underlying many of the topics already discussed, but I felt it should be called out since this attitude affects everything else, and it paid off for me big time.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;table&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src=\"http://lh5.ggpht.com/_or_7Q5ytcj4/S_ugMLlVOjI/AAAAAAAAA-E/s2uDHxYovRg/s800/IMG_0249.JPG\" width=\"420\"&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt; &lt;center&gt;&lt;b&gt;Pinar learning the value of having a climbing pack pre-rigged to jettison onto the climbing rope in the event of a crevasse fall.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br&gt;For example, having a morbid imagination is a good thing. Imagining and discussing the ways you can die, get injured, or become separated while climbing allows one to be better prepared &ndash; provided that such imaginings are given realistic weight. Such visualization helps inform me into what to bring, what to practice, and whether I really should be doing what I am doing at the time (e.g. climbing without a rope). As far as what to bring, in the past I&rsquo;ve often heard people suggest leaving a particular safety item behind because we probably won&rsquo;t need it. While this can be all right within reason as you can&rsquo;t bring everything with you, you should be wary of the pitfall of just assuming that you won&rsquo;t need the gear. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I&rsquo;m always trying to be safer and better prepared, and although it is an unobtainable goal, it is one worth striving for. To put the attitude succinctly: No one ever plans to have an accident, but they should plan to be prepared for one.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   &lt;a name=\"chapter_22\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;A Word on Why You Shouldn\'t Believe Early Media Reports on Mountaineering Accidents&lt;/h2&gt;Some people still seem to insist on believing what the media reported over what I had to say about what happened. Well, my claiming that their earlier reports are false and not to be believed is not a defensive or paranoid reaction. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I learned a lot from Mt. Shasta as to how little research is done before reporting something as fact. And once one outlet makes a claim, even if it is unfounded, many of the other news outlets then reference that claim as fact rather than checking up on it. I witnessed this first-hand as stories were first reported locally, then repeated nationally, and then repeated internationally.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Here are a few examples of the sloppiness of the earlier reports, which should cast doubt on their ability to report the finer details of a topic that they were unfamiliar with:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;1. Tom was said to be engaged to be married. He was not.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;2. I was said in the days after Shasta to have returned to Berkeley and was reunited with my father. This was news to me, since I stayed at the town of Mt. Shasta to meet the family and wait around for Tom\'s recovery. Such a reunion happened a week after the media reported it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;3. In many reports, the articles couldn\'t even keep the names \'Tom Bennett\' and \'Mark Thomas\' straight, and some articles even had \'Tom\' performing CPR on \'Mark\'.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;4. The mountain was reported as being closed to climbing. Mt. Shasta is never closed to climbing.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;5. We were reported as climbing the mountain without permits. We had all the permits that were possible for our approach.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;6. When the media couldn\'t find credible people to interview for the early stories, they went so far as to interview gym climbers and ask them to speculate on the accident.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As far as I know for how I was approached by the media, and what those involved in the rescue reported, there was virtually no fact-checking done on anything reported. The attitude of the media was that if they couldn\'t verify a fact, they would make a best guess and report that. So consider that this is how many agencies operate whenever you see a television or newspaper story.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          &lt;a name=\"chapter_23\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Images&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div align=\"center\"&gt;&lt;table id=\"my_images\"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/mt-shasta-north-side/624040/c-624046\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Mt Shasta North Side\" src=\"/images/square/624040.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/mt-shasta-tragedy-descent-routes/625659/c-624046\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Mt Shasta Tragedy - Descent Routes\" src=\"/images/square/625659.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/mt-shasta-tragedy-day-2-winds/625817/c-624046\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Mt Shasta Tragedy - Day 2 Winds \" src=\"/images/square/625817.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/mt-shasta-tragedy-day-3-winds/625818/c-624046\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Mt Shasta Tragedy - Day 3 Winds \" src=\"/images/square/625818.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/article&gt;date:difficulty:elevation:grade:'),(301,694359,'/size-matters-a-gear-comparison/694359','','Size Matters: A Gear Comparison','Mountaineering, Trad Climbing, Sport Climbing, Aid Climbing, Big Wall','','','','',56389,0,0,'','','',0,'','','','','','','Article','content: &lt;article&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_1\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2 id=\"first_h2\"&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;To me, the discussion of climbing gear is dominated by numbers. It is a quantitative topic composed of facts, figures, and specs. How much does a piece of gear weigh? How strong is it? What is the range of protection? Etcetera, etcetera. Of course, then there are the less tangible aspects of different designs that are hard to compare. All of these considerations must be brought together when deciding strategically what gear we should purchase with our limited funds, or haul up with our practical limitations outside. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And yet, all of these quantitative strategies must be brought to a far less quantifiable world. Equipment rarely breaks. It is usually the quality of the placement or the rock that fails. One rarely knows exactly what sizes are needed or how much redundancy they should have in their rack. For those that really care, there are many details to keep track of, and a lot of uncertainty.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;While I&rsquo;m often pretty meticulous in planning for climbs, I have difficulty working with these stale, lifeless numbers. I need to give meaning to them - meaning that gear catalogues never seem to provide. So that is why I made the following figures for this article. Frankly, saying that a #3 Camalot or its equivalent should be brought to a climb means nothing to me. I need a way to make these numbers more intuitive and more tangible. &lt;a name=\"chapter_2\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Relating Yourself to the Rock&lt;/h2&gt;First off, a lot of the cracks you place pro in are also used for ascending the rock. In the simpler case to consider, you might be on a crack climb. The topo will call out the width of the crack, which as a number might be hard to fully understand, but it is very important information. It tells you both the type of gear needed to protect the section and also the type of climbing to expect.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Figure 1 shows the various types of moves that work on a crack of a given size, based off of my own body measurements. Where there is overlap but one technique is probably preferred, I made the cutoff on the extreme end of the preferred technique. Later on I&rsquo;ll also consider the larger sizes.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;table style=\"width:auto;\"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/QXS_4YLmE2HvbgY20EdfWg?feat=embedwebsite\" target=\"0\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"http://lh5.ggpht.com/_or_7Q5ytcj4/TTpubM9SLJI/AAAAAAAAGWc/NU6Ga0_0rdQ/s640/%281%29-Trad%20Gear%20Specs%20-%20Body%20Ranges%20-%20Close.jpg\" width=\"800\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style=\"font-family:arial,sans-serif; font-size:18px; text-align:center\"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Figure 1&lt;/b&gt; &lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_3\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Relating Gear to the Rock&lt;/h2&gt;In the following sections I look at active pro  and passive pro. I&rsquo;ve organized the charts by gear manufacturer, first showing the range &amp;amp; distribution of ranges covered in the various sizes, and next by showing the weight of the gear in relation to the protection size covered.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;To aid in comparing between manufacturers, in most of the charts I underlay the size &amp;amp; weight distributions of Black Diamond gear as a common benchmark. I chose BD because it seems to be the most popular manufacturer and because they have the largest range of SLCD sizes available. The size charts should help you visualize the range distribution and overlap of a given piece of pro, and the amount of redundancy between cam models of the same manufacturer. The weight graphs can help in visualized what I&rsquo;ll call &ldquo;weight efficiency&rdquo;, which relates the price paid in the weight of a piece of pro to achieve a given range of protection.&lt;a name=\"chapter_4\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Active Pro &lt;/h2&gt;In this section I compare various types of active pro - mostly Spring Loaded Camming Units (SLCDs), but also Ball Nutz &amp;amp; Big Bros. Ranges are those provided by the manufacturers and might not necessarily be those that are appropriate for the gear, which I discuss in the last section of the article. One benefit of using active pro versus passive pro is that the protection range is a continuum between the maximum and minimum sizes, so you can expect a piece of pro to protect anything within that size range that the rock geometry will allow based on how the pro works.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For those not familiar with SLCDs, some of the basic differences to consider are the number of camming heads, the number of stems in the cam, and whether or not the pivot points of the cam heads are aligned or offset. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Regarding camming heads, the standard cams have 4 camming heads and the tri-cam units (TCUs) have have 3 camming heads, and therefore a narrower profile. Since TCUs have fewer heads, they exert higher stresses on the rocks since there is less bearing area to hold the cam in, but the narrower profile allows placements in narrower pockets or flares. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A basic consideration for stems is that single stems have less material in the cam and are more flexible. This means that the stem bends better over edges and that the cam is less likely to walk (move) as the rope tugs on the pro.  Double stems can be nice in that you can more easily pull the trigger to contract the cam heads for placement (try doing it with one finger on a single stem!).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Most cams have all of the camming heads rotate off of one axis, but for some specialized cams, and a prominent feature in Black Diamond&rsquo;s cams, the cam heads on one side rotate around a different axle &amp;amp; axis than the heads on the other side of the stem. This allows for a greater protection range for the cam and allows the cam to function safely as a chock/wedge/nut when the heads are fully extended.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_5\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Black Diamond&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;br&gt;Figure 2 shows the ranges for the various Black Diamond Camalot SLCDs. The C3s are tri-cam units. All Black Diamond SLCDs have single stems and offset cam axes. In general you can see that there is a lot of overlap in protection ranges between sizes. Also, the larger the cam size, the greater the protection range.  The greatest overlap in ranges is biased towards the smaller protection sizes.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;table style=\"width:auto;\"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/4Hy7bRoKzQmPFcSljPW49A?feat=embedwebsite\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"http://lh4.ggpht.com/_or_7Q5ytcj4/TTpuKVWgrPI/AAAAAAAAGT0/DBC2O1SUqj8/s912/%283%29-Trad%20Gear%20Specs%20-%20Equipment%20Ranges%20-%20Black%20Diamond.jpg\" width=\"800\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style=\"font-family:arial,sans-serif; font-size:18px; text-align:center\"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Figure 2&lt;/b&gt; &lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Figure 3 shows the weight efficiency for Black Diamond SLCDs. It&rsquo;s obvious that by eliminating the 4th camming head for the C3s, the C3 Camalots are a lot lighter for the same protection range. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;(The mid-size C4s in this graph are shown with my hand-measured protection size range so that part of the graph is shaped a little differently due to the higher protection end being truncated. I could take the time to change this to be more consistent, but I feel the basic idea gets across either way).&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;table style=\"width:auto;\"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/7aEQ0Cnkoz3DzpiZXhwxYg?feat=embedwebsite\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"http://lh4.ggpht.com/_or_7Q5ytcj4/TTpuZfGkMSI/AAAAAAAAGWM/tdUYEs1Oe5Q/s512/%284%29-Trad%20Gear%20Specs%20-%20Weight%20-%20Close%20-%20Black%20Diamond.jpg\" width=\"400\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style=\"font-family:arial,sans-serif; font-size:18px; text-align:center\"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Figure 3&lt;/b&gt; &lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_6\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h3&gt;DMM&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;br&gt;Figure 4 shows the ranges for the various DMM SLCDs. 3CUs are TCUs. The 3CU &amp;amp; 4CU Cams are double-stem cams with the heads aligned on a single axis. The Dragon Cams have a single stem and the cam head axes are offset. As can be seen here, there is more redundancy in protection sizes between the 3CU and 4CUs, while in the Black Diamond cams the 3CUs protected to a smaller size overall and only redundant in the largest 3CU size. The effect of the offset cam head axes of the Dragon cams is apparent with the larger protection range, which is similar to the Black Diamond cams of the same size.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;table style=\"width:auto;\"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/LbPSv8tyeqndfL7uaM6nnA?feat=embedwebsite\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"http://lh3.ggpht.com/_or_7Q5ytcj4/TTpuLO6oflI/AAAAAAAAGT8/wHvz-9wLrOU/s912/%285%29-Trad%20Gear%20Specs%20-%20Equipment%20Ranges%20-%20DMM%20SLCDs.jpg\" width=\"800\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style=\"font-family:arial,sans-serif; font-size:18px; text-align:center\"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Figure 4&lt;/b&gt; &lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Figure 5 shows the weight efficiency for DMM SLCDs. Surprisingly, the 3CUs aren&rsquo;t really any lighter than the 4CUs, so choosing one over the other should not take weight differences into account. The 4CU line is obviously lighter than the Black Diamond cams &ndash; especially in the larger sizes. The Dragon Cams are more similar to the Black Diamond cams in weight. It appears that although some weight is reduced by having only one stem, much more weight is added by the addition of two camming axes.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;table style=\"width:auto;\"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/heGUDWgqLWCQ9fZNrGW0Bg?feat=embedwebsite\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"http://lh4.ggpht.com/_or_7Q5ytcj4/TTpuU74GvcI/AAAAAAAAGVs/5nQ6iFvEy1w/s512/%286%29-Trad%20Gear%20Specs%20-%20Weight%20-%20Close%20-%20DMM.jpg\" width=\"400\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style=\"font-family:arial,sans-serif; font-size:18px; text-align:center\"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Figure 5&lt;/b&gt; &lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_7\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Metolius&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;br&gt;Figure 6 shows the ranges for the various Metolius SLCDs. The TCUS are, well, TCUs, and are identical in protection ranges to the other SLCDs. Master Cams have a single stem and are identical to Power Cams in the protection ranges, although the 4 cam head arrangement is built to be narrower. The TCUs, Power Cams, and Super Cams have a double-stem build. Super Cams have a unique arrangement to give them a greater protection range &ndash; differently sized camming heads, with the smaller head rotating a full 180 degrees when fully contracted. The greater range provided by this is small on the smaller size, but larger in the larger sizes.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In general, compared to the Black Diamond series, Metolius has more types of cams and less overlap of protection sizes between pieces &ndash; especially in the smaller range. There is also more redundancy between cam types, so you&rsquo;re choosing one over the other more for other features than the protection range unless you are getting the expanded range of the Super Cams.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;table style=\"width:auto;\"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/IhlYnr3xTeko_2rPIUHG5g?feat=embedwebsite\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"http://lh6.ggpht.com/_or_7Q5ytcj4/TTpuNr91VTI/AAAAAAAAGUk/wXJCDuCd1_w/s800/%287%29-Trad%20Gear%20Specs%20-%20Equipment%20Ranges%20-%20Metolius.jpg\" width=\"800\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style=\"font-family:arial,sans-serif; font-size:18px; text-align:center\"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Figure 6&lt;/b&gt; &lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Figure 7 shows the weight efficiency for Metolius SLCDs. Here the TCUs are slightly lighter than the Power Cams, but the difference is smaller than the TCUs of the Black Diamond cams. For some reason the Master Cams still weigh the most even though the only obvious design change is the elimination of one of the stems. Overall the main line of Metolius Cams is far lighter than the Black Diamond Cams. However, the Super Cams are significantly heavier than the C4s and overlapping protections sizes of the Power Cams. A great weight cost was added for the expanded range, and it is greater for this method than the offset cam head axis.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;(The Power Cams &amp;amp; Super Cams in this graph are shown with my hand-measured protection size range so those parts of the graph are shaped a little differently due to the higher protection end being truncated.

All cams are single stem. Splitter 4 Cams have the opposing cam lobes occupy the same plane of rotation, so the 4 cam lobe head is narrower like a TCU without compromising holding power. All cams are single stem with an aligned cam head axis. The Splitter 4 Cam sizes are mostly redundant with the Flex Cams, and both series have less overlap in protection ranges between sizes than Black Diamond, but not as great as Metolius. One surprising thing to note is that the protection range is really large despite any obvious change in the cam head axis alignment or any other obvious difference in cam form. Perhaps it has to do with the choice of spiral shape for the cam lobe outside edge?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;table style=\"width:auto;\"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/4R9tVpTCHwtLl371avoeUA?feat=embedwebsite\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"http://lh5.ggpht.com/_or_7Q5ytcj4/TTpuOZxdaaI/AAAAAAAAGUs/lODH6zcYebU/s912/%289%29-Trad%20Gear%20Specs%20-%20Equipment%20Ranges%20-%20Trango.jpg\" width=\"800\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style=\"font-family:arial,sans-serif; font-size:18px; text-align:center\"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Figure 8&lt;/b&gt; &lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Ball Nutz are more specialized pro and work similar to a nut (and are only manufactured by Trango &amp;amp; C.A.M.P.). They are Trango&rsquo;s answer to smaller protection sizes and fill the niche of pro that works in flaring cracks that spit out cams &amp;amp; nuts. The size range also includes smaller sizes, allowing an active protection option in cracks too small for TCUs, including parallel cracks that will not take nuts. Big Bros are specialized pro on the large end and cover the super wide ranges (and only manufactured by Trango), which is discussed in a later section. They are basically spring-loaded tubes with a beveled end and offset attachment to encourage both wedging and camming actions.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Figure 9 shows the weight efficiency for Trango active pro. The Splitter 4 Cams are lighter than the Flex Cams, but only slightly so. However, both cam lines are significantly lighter than the 3Cs &amp;amp; 4Cs. Flex cams seem to be the clear winner among manufacturers in regards to expansion range offered versus the weight cost for that protection range.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;table style=\"width:auto;\"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/L6rAkySLW8tjSs618sBmLg?feat=embedwebsite\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"http://lh6.ggpht.com/_or_7Q5ytcj4/TTpujb5OTEI/AAAAAAAAGXs/gr4upeyCLLI/s512/%2810%29-Trad%20Gear%20Specs%20-%20Weight%20-%20Close%20-%20Trango.jpg\" width=\"400\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style=\"font-family:arial,sans-serif; font-size:18px; text-align:center\"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Figure 9&lt;/b&gt; &lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Ball Nutz, while protecting a smaller size, are obviously not as efficient from a weight perspective, and Splitter 4 Cams are lighter for the same protection range. Big Bros are the clear winner in terms of weight efficiency. They blow the SLCDs out of the water! However, there are other costs in terms of performance not shown here.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_9\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Expanded Range SLCDs (Omega Pacific &amp;amp; Metolius)&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;br&gt;Figure 10 shows the ranges for the Omega Pacific Link Cams and the Metolius Super Cams. Both SLCDs are advertised specifically for the greater range they provide versus the ordinary SLCD. It is apparent that Link Cams offer a wide protection range only in the smaller sizes, while Super Cams only provide it in the larger sizes. So if you want a full set of expanded range cams, you&rsquo;d better stock up on both.  The Link Cams have much greater overlap in sizes than the Super Cams, and the relative increase in protection range provided is much greater. Finally, the Link Cam sizes differ most in their maximum protection width and are for the most part pretty similar on the smallest protection size.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;table style=\"width:auto;\"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/SD8hC1gt47CCOH3FSOx1UA?feat=embedwebsite\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"http://lh6.ggpht.com/_or_7Q5ytcj4/TTpuLhilRuI/AAAAAAAAGUE/3m23w70wwus/s912/%2811%29-Trad%20Gear%20Specs%20-%20Equipment%20Ranges%20-%20Expanded%20Range.jpg\" width=\"800\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style=\"font-family:arial,sans-serif; font-size:18px; text-align:center\"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Figure 10&lt;/b&gt; &lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In general, the Super Cams don&rsquo;t offer much of an expanded range as compared to the C4s &ndash; especially on the small size. The same can be said about the 0.5 &amp;amp; 0.75 Link Cams.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Figure 11 shows the weight efficiency for Link Cams and Super Cams. It is apparent from this graph that there is a greater cost in weight for the expanded range SLCDs. However, the smallest 2 sizes of the Link Cams are about the same weight as the C4s, although their &ldquo;expanded&rdquo; protection range is also about the same.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;table style=\"width:auto;\"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/3klKzpyisawq_yDPrZ6yIQ?feat=embedwebsite\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"http://lh4.ggpht.com/_or_7Q5ytcj4/TTpuW1i26II/AAAAAAAAGV8/JCLIqZf05qI/s512/%2812%29-Trad%20Gear%20Specs%20-%20Weight%20-%20Close%20-%20Expanded%20Range%20Cams.jpg\" width=\"400\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style=\"font-family:arial,sans-serif; font-size:18px; text-align:center\"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Figure 11&lt;/b&gt; &lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;My conclusion from this comparison with the weight and protection range criteria &ndash; only buy the size 1 &amp;amp; 2 Link Cams, and then just go with the DMM 4CUs or the Trango Flex Cams. It appears that the innovative design of the Super Cam is a bust and doesn&rsquo;t provide much real gain in overall performance versus other cams from Metolius and other manufacturers.&lt;a name=\"chapter_10\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Passive Pro&lt;/h2&gt;In this section passive pro such as nuts, hexes, &amp;amp; tri-cams are compared in a similar way as the active pro in the previous section. One thing to consider about passive pro that does not come across in the graphs is that the protection sizes are more discrete, so a given size range is likely to only protect the largest and smallest size, and little in between. It is trickier to nail down exactly what the protection sizes actually are since it depends on which way the complex geometry of the pieces is used (I counted 7 discrete ways for hexcentrics, with some continuum protection possible in the 3 camming modes!). For simplicity here, I just show the size listed by the manufacturers, which mostly relates to the measurements of the geometry of the pro, such as width and depth for nuts.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_11\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Nuts &amp;amp; Ball Nutz&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;br&gt;Nuts can be divided into two categories: micro nuts (RPs) and regular nuts. Sometimes called wedges, chocks, and stoppers, these pieces work almost purely through wedging action in the rock. Micro stoppers tend to protect the smallest sizes and are usually made of a softer metal to encourage bonding/fusing with the rock surface to hold them into place (e.g. copper heads). They also have narrower profiles to make it easier to make placements in smaller cracks, though at the cost of less variation in protection sizes. Black Diamond&rsquo;s MicroStoppers have more of a box shape to them that allows different types of placements. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As seen in Figure 12, nuts are used as protection only in the very small sizes. There is also a lot more overlap in ranges as compared to SLCDs, probably as a result of the more discrete protection dimensions actually available in between the maximum &amp;amp; minimum sizes. Note that the smallest 2 sizes are weak enough to be rated only for body weight and are not appropriate for lead falls. An interesting comparison here is that Ball Nutz active pro protect to sizes as thin as the narrowest nut, but theoretically they are all able to hold a lead climbing fall.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;table style=\"width:auto;\"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/s_euIi4yQ3NT-5knnP4XXw?feat=embedwebsite\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"http://lh3.ggpht.com/_or_7Q5ytcj4/TTpuNKIc0DI/AAAAAAAAGUc/DfDm0YoupiY/s912/%2813%29-Trad%20Gear%20Specs%20-%20Equipment%20Ranges%20-%20Nuts.jpg\" width=\"800\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style=\"font-family:arial,sans-serif; font-size:18px; text-align:center\"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Figure 12&lt;/b&gt; &lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Figure 13 shows the weight efficiency of the nuts. They are hands down much more efficient than any cam, which most of us climbers are well aware of. This nicely illustrates that weight efficiency isn&rsquo;t the only criteria one should use for gear, since cams are so much more versatile and convenient to place. However, if you&rsquo;re on a route where nuts work as well as cams, you&rsquo;re better off leaving the smaller cams at home &ndash; especially on routes where weight matters such as aid climbing and alpine climbing. Surprisingly, the RPs don&rsquo;t protect that much smaller of a size than the regular nuts, and aren&rsquo;t any lighter.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;table style=\"width:auto;\"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/Bb-35aX5Y9J2lmcy3TUX-w?feat=embedwebsite\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"http://lh5.ggpht.com/_or_7Q5ytcj4/TTpuRYJl8HI/AAAAAAAAGVM/oxeS9N6CEaY/s512/%2814%29-Trad%20Gear%20Specs%20-%20Weight%20-%20Closest%20-%20Nuts.jpg\" width=\"400\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style=\"font-family:arial,sans-serif; font-size:18px; text-align:center\"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Figure 13&lt;/b&gt; &lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_12\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Hexcentrics&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;br&gt;Hexcentrics (usually just called hexes), can work both as nuts and as camming devices. This is one answer to parallel cracks for passive pro. As seen in Figure 14, hexes have similar protection ranges and overlap to SLCDs and also protect much wider than nuts. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;table style=\"width:auto;\"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/eq5V6ZWSJCWJAMdg07Ztyw?feat=embedwebsite\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"http://lh3.ggpht.com/_or_7Q5ytcj4/TTpuMh9OAZI/AAAAAAAAGUU/1oSRsZxuPEU/s912/%2815%29-Trad%20Gear%20Specs%20-%20Equipment%20Ranges%20-%20Hexes.jpg\" width=\"800\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style=\"font-family:arial,sans-serif; font-size:18px; text-align:center\"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Figure 14&lt;/b&gt; &lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Similar to nuts, Figure 15 shows that hexes have much better weight efficiency than SLCDs as well. So, similar to nuts, hexes are a nice replacement for SLCDs on climbs where weight is important and one can expect to make pro placements from easier stances or have more options for placements. They also make nice music as they clang around on your harness.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;table style=\"width:auto;\"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/qYP6mDKUYIB5Uh7sBwslaw?feat=embedwebsite\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"http://lh6.ggpht.com/_or_7Q5ytcj4/TTpuc2c8UkI/AAAAAAAAGWs/2xQ_xeBFLFk/s512/%2816%29-Trad%20Gear%20Specs%20-%20Weight%20-%20Hexes.jpg\" width=\"400\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style=\"font-family:arial,sans-serif; font-size:18px; text-align:center\"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Figure 15&lt;/b&gt; &lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_13\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Tri-Cams&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;br&gt;Tri-Cams are similar to hexes in that they protect through camming and also have a wedging mode. While the wedging mode is more limited, the camming mode is actually continuous, like active pro, making them much more ideal for passive pro camming placements. The tether attached to them also bends nicely over edges, making them more ideal than SLCDs for placements where the stem would be pulled across a corner, such as in horizontal cracks.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;table style=\"width:auto;\"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/F-LCClZpRLLi8IBO3lXBEw?feat=embedwebsite\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"http://lh6.ggpht.com/_or_7Q5ytcj4/TTpuMNiT_jI/AAAAAAAAGUM/K46nSz6vyF8/s912/%2818%29-Trad%20Gear%20Specs%20-%20Equipment%20Ranges%20-%20Tri-Cams.jpg\" width=\"800\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style=\"font-family:arial,sans-serif; font-size:18px; text-align:center\"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Figure 16&lt;/b&gt; &lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Figure 16 shows that C.A.M.P. Tri-Cams have slightly less overlap in protection ranges than hexes but protect to a wider size. They can cover nearly the entire protection range of the Black Diamond SLCDs. Similar to other passive pro, Figure 17 shows that Tri-Cams are much more weight efficient than SLCDs. They occupy a nice niche of functional and weight efficiency differences between hexes and SLCDs.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;table style=\"width:auto;\"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/xCfIiJmDgEnItHehOg7mdQ?feat=embedwebsite\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"http://lh6.ggpht.com/_or_7Q5ytcj4/TTpuPoMRmdI/AAAAAAAAGU8/3Z1B0vVnuSk/s512/%2819%29-Trad%20Gear%20Specs%20-%20Weight%20-%20Tri-Cam.jpg\" width=\"400\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style=\"font-family:arial,sans-serif; font-size:18px; text-align:center\"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Figure 17&lt;/b&gt; &lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_14\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Comparisons&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;br&gt;Figure 18 shows all types of passive pro compared by weight efficiency. Overall Tri-Camps are the most efficient across the entire range, while nuts can protect the smallest sizes.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;table style=\"width:auto;\"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/8c6Wh8OCNnl6PeEDYkIXMA?feat=embedwebsite\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"http://lh4.ggpht.com/_or_7Q5ytcj4/TTpuTm4rEdI/AAAAAAAAGVk/NiI0H625Yd0/s512/%2820%29-Trad%20Gear%20Specs%20-%20Weight%20-%20Close%20-%20Passive%20Pro.jpg\" width=\"400\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style=\"font-family:arial,sans-serif; font-size:18px; text-align:center\"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Figure 18&lt;/b&gt; &lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_15\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The Small Sizes&lt;/h2&gt;Speaking of the smallest sizes, because there are so many types of pro that protect here, and it is harder to compare them on the larger scale size, I&rsquo;ll look specifically at them here.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Figure 19 shows the weight efficiency of all of the passive pro variations. Similar to the earlier comparison, nuts are the least efficient but protect in the smallest ranges, and Tri-Cams are the most efficient and can protect a continuum of sizes. Hexes fall somewhere in between.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;table style=\"width:auto;\"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/Tb6LtZ2BdJlNoohwR1-UAw?feat=embedwebsite\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"http://lh5.ggpht.com/_or_7Q5ytcj4/TTpuSKd6SOI/AAAAAAAAGVU/wwLx6pKD4G0/s512/%2821%29-Trad%20Gear%20Specs%20-%20Weight%20-%20Closest%20-%20Passive%20Pro.jpg\" width=\"400\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style=\"font-family:arial,sans-serif; font-size:18px; text-align:center\"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Figure 19&lt;/b&gt; &lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Figure 20 shows the weight efficiency of all of the active pro variations and nuts for comparison. Basically, nuts are the lightest option for the ultra-small sizes. Metolius TCUs are the way to go for efficiency in SLCDs, while Black Diamond&rsquo;s 3CUs are the least efficient of the bunch. Ball Nutz are heavier than either nut or SLCD option for the same protection size (unless it is compared to the 3CUs).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;table style=\"width:auto;\"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/ZPi45grMJej3OSRhFHh0Xg?feat=embedwebsite\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"http://lh3.ggpht.com/_or_7Q5ytcj4/TTpuSk2ibCI/AAAAAAAAGVc/c-wnnz2G9As/s512/%2822%29-Trad%20Gear%20Specs%20-%20Weight%20-%20Closest%20-%20Active%20%26%20Nuts.jpg\" width=\"400\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style=\"font-family:arial,sans-serif; font-size:18px; text-align:center\"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Figure 20&lt;/b&gt; &lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_16\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The Ultra-Wide&lt;/h2&gt;For those that like the wide stuff, Figure 21 shows the various types of moves that work on a crack of a given size, based off of my own body measurements, for crack all the way to chimney size. Where there is overlap but one technique is probably preferred, I made the cutoff on the extreme end of the preferred technique.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;table style=\"width:auto;\"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/9DzJAiW0d18OJTBj5m9DnA?feat=embedwebsite\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"http://lh5.ggpht.com/_or_7Q5ytcj4/TTpuJgZIXRI/AAAAAAAAGTs/wlxue3rRWaU/s912/%2823%29-Trad%20Gear%20Specs%20-%20Body%20Ranges.jpg\" width=\"800\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style=\"font-family:arial,sans-serif; font-size:18px; text-align:center\"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Figure 21&lt;/b&gt; &lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_17\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Trango&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;br&gt;Tango is the only manufacturer that makes active pro that protects from the smallest to the largest sizes. No other manufacturer of active pro comes close &ndash; especially on the larger protection sizes made available by the Big Bros (Figure 22). So if you want to protect the wider off-widths to smaller chimneys, Big Bros are the only way to go.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;table style=\"width:auto;\"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/VPEf0Y9xkXbBioN8Av5pHg?feat=embedwebsite\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"http://lh5.ggpht.com/_or_7Q5ytcj4/TTpuOw6DV4I/AAAAAAAAGU0/LdyrlBbe_bY/s912/%2824%29-Trad%20Gear%20Specs%20-%20Equipment%20Ranges%20-%20Trango%20Full.jpg\" width=\"800\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style=\"font-family:arial,sans-serif; font-size:18px; text-align:center\"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Figure 22&lt;/b&gt; &lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It is also interesting to look at Figure 23, which shows the weight efficiency of the entire line of Trango active pro. It protects smaller than Black Diamond and is more efficient across all protection sizes. The Big Bros are by far the most weight efficient design for pro.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;table style=\"width:auto;\"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/CIuR-z08iKzEjXj1rEbkrQ?feat=embedwebsite\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"http://lh5.ggpht.com/_or_7Q5ytcj4/TTpulJFqtAI/AAAAAAAAGX8/A-sOtkGYWpg/s912/%2825%29-Trad%20Gear%20Specs%20-%20Weight%20-%20Trango.jpg\" width=\"800\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style=\"font-family:arial,sans-serif; font-size:18px; text-align:center\"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Figure 23&lt;/b&gt; &lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_18\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Appendix&lt;/h2&gt;Basically, other things that people might want to consider that didn&rsquo;t quite fit the overall flow of the article.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_19\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Advertized vs. Actual Protection Ranges for Pro&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;br&gt;This final section looks specifically at SLCDs, comparing the protection size listed by the manufacturer with the actual usable protection sizes and maximum geometries that I measured off of my own cams. How wide is usable for a cam? For an easy comparison, I started with Metolius since they use a color-coded system on the cam heads to categorize the safety of cam size placements. Since they have some amount of liability in stating what is a good (green), adequate (yellow) and questionable (red) range, this is easy to measure with confidence that some thought and engineering considerations are behind the classifications. I also compared my other cams just considering the maximum geometry compared to the manufacturer&rsquo;s stated range.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In Figure 24 there are some interesting findings. For most of the cams, the stated maximum range is near the actual maximum geometry, so as a rule of thumb, remember that the range you see in the catalogues is not the actual range you&rsquo;ll be using! Metolius cams are the exception, with the maximum range for the smaller cams being at about the transition between the adequate and questionable range. However, as the cams get larger, the stated range gets deeper into the questionable range &ndash; especially with the expanded range cams.

Is it a glacier? Maybe, maybe not. Even if it has metamorphosed into ice, it still may be a permanent snowfield. The critical feature that glaciers have is movement. The glacier may start out as a permanent snowfield or icefield, but eventually the weight of the ice becomes so great compared to the friction holding it in place that the body of ice moves downhill. At the same time, enough new snow is added to the glacier to constantly replenish the ice at the top of the glacier. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The area of a glacier that retains snow year-round is called the accumulation zone, and as the ice compacts, it moves downhill to an elevation where more melting occurs on the surface and eventually the presence of ice is due solely to ice that has moved downhill rather than remaining from prior years. This area of the glacier that completely melts out is called the ablation zone. The dividing line between the accumulation zone and the ablation zone is the firn line, and in mid-latitude glaciers it is easily visible, as in the photo above, as the lingering snow stays whiter while the melted out ablation zone is left dark and dirty in late season. Can you spot these features on the Palisade Glacier, picture above?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If the glacier is in equilibrium, the head and terminus of the glacier will remain stationary as the melt at the bottom matches the addition of ice at the top. Although the glacier may appear stationary, it is still moving and eroding. Glaciers recede or grow when the formation of ice at higher altitudes becomes out of balance with the melt of the glacier at lower altitudes. The movement of the firn line is an easy way to tell if a glacier is growing or shrinking. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div align=\"center\" class=\"image\" style=\"width: 506px;\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"/diagram-of-a-glacier/700696\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Diagram of a Glacier\" height=\"384\" width=\"500\" src=\"/images/medium/700696.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=\"caption\"&gt;A diagram of what a glacier is and how it works.

(Canadian Rockies, Alberta, Canada)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_4\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Rock Glaciers&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;br&gt;Sometimes the firn line moves beyond the top of the glacier, so the entire glacier melts away. However, if enough rocks fall onto the ice, the rock will act as an insulator of the ice against the heat, preserving the ice beneath. The glacier may look like just a flowing pile of rocks, but there may still be ice flowing underneath.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_5\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Hanging Glaciers&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;br&gt;Hanging glaciers are glaciers that do not melt out at the bottom. Instead, the glacier plunges off of a cliff. The terminus is an icefall of seracs. These glaciers appear to be hanging on the mountainside, and it is generally a good idea not to linger below them, as they are always dropping massive chunks of ice off the cliff, creating devastating ice avalanches.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_6\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Miscellaneous Glacier Features&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_7\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Moulins&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;br&gt;Moulins are holes in the glacier burrowed by flowing water. During the summer months when there is a lot of melting, water may pour down the surface of a glacier like a river. If this water hits a small crevasse, the water will erode the ice and burrow down, sometimes to the bedrock, creating a subterranean river. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Moulins are very hazardous as if you fall into meltwater on a glacier, you may be swept into one of these and into the depths of the glacier and you will probably drown. They are found in ablation zones and usually form or open up in the later season when a lot of melting is occurring.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div align=\"center\" class=\"image\" style=\"width: 506px;\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"/glacial-river-moulin/700698\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Glacial River &amp;amp; Moulin\" height=\"170\" width=\"500\" src=\"/images/medium/700698.JPG\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=\"caption\"&gt;A river forms on the surface of the Athabasca Glacier during intensive summer melting (left),  disappearing into a moulin formed in the longitudinal crevasse near the glacier terminus (right).

You can clearly see the bergshrunds lining the tops of the glaciers. The white snow is the accumulation zone, and the darker ablation zone can be seen in the lower left corner. Also note the melt channels, which are a sign of snow stability, but also potentially weaker snow bridges (Wind River Range, WY) &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_8\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Bergschrunds&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;br&gt;Bergschrunds are the gaps formed by the separation of the moving glacier and any stationary ground above, which is usually a permanent snowfield or ice couloirs. They can be very wide and broad, but generally aren&rsquo;t as deep as crevasses as they tend to fill with debris falling down from above the glacier. Bergschrunds provide major barriers to exiting a glacier or entering a couloir as once snow bridges melt out, they can form continuous vertical or overhanging walls of ice.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div align=\"center\" class=\"image\" style=\"width: 206px;\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"/bob-the-bergschrund/700706\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Bob &amp;amp; the Bergschrund\" height=\"150\" width=\"200\" src=\"/images/small/700706.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=\"caption\"&gt;Bergshcrunds often make it difficult to exit a glacier (Middle Palisade Glacier, Sierra Nevada, CA)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_9\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Moats&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;br&gt;Because the darker rocks along the edge of glaciers absorb heat from sunlight, they tend to melt away the snow and ice adjacent to it. Although moats can be tens of feet deep and wide, they are generally smaller than crevasses. Still, they can pose barriers to entering or exiting a glacier, similar to bergschrunds.                                                                                      &lt;a name=\"chapter_10\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Glacial Erosion&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_11\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Plucking &amp;amp; Grinding&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;br&gt;A glacier erodes through two processes &ndash; plucking and grinding. Grinding occurs as the ice abrades rock and wears it down. Rock worn by a glacier is easily identified by the smooth glacial polish left behind from this. Contrary to popular conception, this is not the main mechanism of glacial erosion, as rocks such as granite abrade too slowly to account for the deep U-shaped valleys carved by glaciers.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Plucking is the main erosion mechanism of glaciers. All rocks have some cracks in them (also called joints). These are formed by the presence of tension. In granite and other metamorphic rocks, joints often form from the contraction of the rock as it cooled. These joints are weaknesses in the rock, and glacial ice tends to catch the edges of joints and &lsquo;pluck&rsquo; out shards of rock, peeling back the rock layer by layer. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Because of this, heavily jointed rock wears down much more quickly and dramatically than rock free of joints. This is also why although the bottoms of glacially carved valleys are smooth and rounded, the sides and headwalls of such valleys are usually very steep and often left as a continuous line of cliffs.  This is also why glacially carved canyons often have fairly flat bottoms interrupted by a series of distinct headwalls, called cirques. Parallel glacially carved valleys tend to leave knife-edge ridges with very steep rock faces on both sides. These ridges are called ar&ecirc;tes.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Alternatively, valleys eroded by water are V-shaped and twist and turn as water is deflected by various types of rock. The large mass and inertia of glaciers create straight valleys as glaciers usually ride up and over, or spill around any obstacles that aren&rsquo;t flattened by the glacier.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div align=\"center\" class=\"image\" style=\"width: 434px;\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"/diagram-of-glacial-erosion/700699\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Diagram of Glacial Erosion\" height=\"500\" width=\"428\" src=\"/images/medium/700699.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=\"caption\"&gt;Glacial erosion through grinding and plucking.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_12\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Remnants of Glacial Erosion&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_13\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Glacial Till&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;br&gt;Glacial till is the soil eroded from glaciers. Usually this till colors water, leaving runoff close to the glacier a milky white color. Depending on the type of rock eroded, this can have dramatic coloring effects further downstream, creating lakes and rivers that are unreal shades of blue, green, and turquoise.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Glacial till also makes water gathered from the toe of the glacier undesirable for dinking as it is essentially muddy water. It also is hard on water filters.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div align=\"center\" class=\"image\" style=\"width: 506px;\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"/mt-biddle-lake-mcarthur/531637\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Mt Biddle &amp;amp; Lake McArthur\" height=\"332\" width=\"500\" src=\"/images/medium/531637.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=\"caption\"&gt;Lake MacArthur and Mt Biddle.

In general there are three types of moraines &ndash; terminal, lateral, and medial. Terminal moraines mark the toe or terminus of the glacier, forming across the width of the glacier. Lateral moraines form alongside the glacier as debris is pushed out from the side of the glacier or from debris that falls onto the edge of the glacier as the glacier undercuts neighboring cliffs. As the debris piles up, it protects the snow beneath from melting, causing these sides of the glacier to remain higher than the center. Medial moraines form when two glaciers flow together, trapping lateral moraines between them. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Once a glacier melts away, moraines are often the only clue of glaciation. Often the terminal and lateral moraines trap water in the valley carved by the glacier, forming a lake where the toe of the glacier once stood. This is how many of the natural lakes and ancient moraines at the mouths of the canyons in the eastern Sierra formed.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Glaciers are always growing and receding, so there are often multiple terminal moraines as the glacier pushes one up, recedes, and then pushes up another. Meltwater from the glacier tends to pile up behind these moraines, forming lakes at the toe of the glacier, called tarns. If a glacier recedes slowly enough, it may do this in many locations along it&rsquo;s track, leaving behind a string of lakes, such as the &ldquo;Numbered&rdquo; lakes in the North Fork of Big Pine in the Palisades region of the High Sierra.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Because moraines are formed by eroded rock and mud pushed up into mounds, they are composed of rotten, friable rock and are very unstable. Not only are they formed in an unstable way, but moraines by existing glaciers are still being pushed. Climbing on moraines is unpleasant and can be dangerous due to falling rock. Take care whenever climbing on moraines and strategize ahead of time to take the line of lowest steepness as the moraine is more stable in these areas.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;On some large moraines, enough mud and soil can collect on top to support plant life, such as on the toe of the Ruth Glacier. These moraines essentially become moving meadows and forests!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div align=\"center\" class=\"image\" style=\"width: 506px;\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"/more-glacial-beauty/200295\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"More Glacial Beauty\" height=\"309\" width=\"500\" src=\"/images/medium/200295.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=\"caption\"&gt;A prominent medial moraine on the Ruth Glacier. You can see lateral moraines on the side. Also note how many of the crevasses are filled with melt water as this was taken in June. (Ruth Gorge, Alaska Range, AK)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_15\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Cleavers, Nunataks, and Roche Moutonnees&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;br&gt;A cleaver is a ridgeline of rock that remains sticking up between various flows of a glacier, like a fin. They can provide means of climbing through a glacier that has heavy crevassing or an icefall. The easiest and most popular route on Mt Rainier, Disappointment Cleaver, ascends a cleaver to pass between the icefalls of two neighboring glaciers to reach the summit. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A nunatak is an exposed rocky element of a ridge, mountain, or peak that protrudes above the ice of a glacier or icefield. A number of the peaks in the Sierra Nevada are ancient nunataks.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Roche moutonnee is a rock or hill sculpted by glacial ice flowing over the top. Usually the uphill side is scoured smooth by the grinding action of the ice, but the downhill side has a steep, fractured face that is left from glacial plucking.  Many of the domes in Tuolumne Meadows in Yosemite National Park are actually remnants of ancient roche moutonees.&lt;br&gt;&lt;div align=\"center\" class=\"image\" style=\"width: 506px;\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"/lembert-dome-overview/667405\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Lembert Dome Overview\" height=\"320\" width=\"500\" src=\"/images/medium/667405.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=\"caption\"&gt;Lembert Dome is a Roche Moutonnee. The glacier flowed from right to left (Tuolumne Meadows, Sierra Nevada, CA)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_16\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Glacial Kinematics&lt;/h2&gt;In this section I will talk briefly about the behavior of glacial ice and how it affects the form of a glacier.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_17\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Creep and Glide&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;br&gt;Glaciers move by a combination of glide and creep. Because ice is plastic when deformed slowly and under pressure, the glacial ice flows downhill like a slow river of ice. Creep is this movement by deformation. Glide is a rigid-body motion of the glacier as it slides down on a bed surface, usually lubricated by meltwater that flows between the bedrock and the underside of the glacier. Creep is what causes plucking, and glide is what causes grinding in glacial erosion.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In general glaciers move faster in the summer, both because the greater melting accelerates glide, and also the warming of the ice make it flow easier, accelerating creep. As such, icefall activity tends to increase during the summer months if it has any variation over the year. Because heat accelerates glacier motion, mid-latitude glaciers can move very fast, reach 1-3 ft of movement per day!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_18\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Kinematic Waves&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;br&gt;Because glacial ice flows, it has many characteristics of a liquid. One is the formation of kinematic waves. These waves are essentially slow-motion shockwaves in the ice that form from very heavy snow years and take years to propagate down the length of the glacier. The increase in load from the extra snow pushes the glacier down harder. When this snow melts or consolidates into the glacier, the glacier springs back up again. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This up and down motion travels down the glacier at a slow pace, but the size of the wave can be quite noticeable. The waves can reach 80 ft in height and move down the glacier faster than the flow of the ice itself, causing the terminus of the glacier to advance dramatically when it reaches the end. Keep in mind that these waves tend to accelerate the ice, which affects seracs and crevasses. At the front of the wave, crevasses tend to shrink, but may then become much larger behind the wave as the ice goes into tension. The waves would also increase the rate of serac fall as the wave passes through icefalls.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_19\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Glacier Surges&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;br&gt;Sometimes the speed of a glacier increases very suddenly, causing a surge in the ice, sometimes of up to &lt;i&gt;30 feet in a day&lt;/i&gt;. This may be from a combination of accelerated glide, creep, and kinematic waves. Critical mass of the glacier or sudden detachment from the base rock layer may be other contributing factors. These surges can completely change the nature of a glacier, making a once passable glacier completely impassable due to the spread of icefalls and crevasses. The Muldrow glacier on Denali used to be an easy walk up until it surged in 1956. Now climbers must climb around the glacier or fly over it.&lt;a name=\"chapter_20\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Crevasses&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_21\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Ice Under Tension, Compression, and Shear&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;br&gt;Ice is weak and brittle in tension, and strong and plastic in compression.  This basic tendency explains much about the formation of crevasses on glaciers, and the understanding of this behavior and where it occurs is key to understanding crevasses and knowing where to expect them. This knowledge is important in planning a route across a glacier, especially if crevasses are buried but you want to minimize the likelihood that you are crossing snow bridges. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In general, crevasses form in tension zones, where the ice undergoes tension. Compression zones on glaciers have few if any crevasses and are generally the way to go for route planning and choosing camps. These zones are formed by direct tension-compression of the ice as the glacier bends, or as a result of shear in the ice that occurs from flow differential. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The figure below shows the relationship between shear and tension. This is important as it explains why crevasses have the orientation that they do, which is also important for predicting crevasse patterns on a glacier. Basically, if a block of ice is subjected to shear (1), say from faster flowing ice, it develops an equal and opposite reaction (2), say from slower moving ice or the stationary ground. These forces would cause the ice segment to spin, except it then develops equilibrating shears (3) perpendicular to (1) and (2). These shear forces can be added up vectorially to get the resulting tension and compression forces, which are equal to [2*shear force]&lt;sup&gt;0.5&lt;/sup&gt; and occur at 45 degrees to the direction of shear.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div align=\"center\" class=\"image\" style=\"width: 506px;\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"/diagram-of-cracking-ice/700700\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Diagram of Cracking Ice\" height=\"264\" width=\"500\" src=\"/images/medium/700700.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=\"caption\"&gt;Force diagram of a square segment of ice.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_22\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Types of Crevasses&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_23\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Transverse Crevasses&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;br&gt;When a glacier travels over a convex surface, such as flat ground rolling into a steeper slope or the glacier rolling over a low bulge, the ice layer bends as the top layers are put into tension and the bottom layers are compressed. Another way to think of it is that the top layer must accelerate to keep up with the bottom layer as it sweeps over a greater distance to round the bulge. This tends to pull the ice apart. Because the tension develops along the fall line, transverse crevasses tend to form as straight crevasses across glaciers, perpendicular to the flow. Conversely, at the bottom of drops or in bowls, the ice is in a compression zone and is generally free of crevasses.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div align=\"center\" class=\"image\" style=\"width: 506px;\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"/transverse-crevasse-formation/700701\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Transverse crevasse formation..\" height=\"385\" width=\"500\" src=\"/images/medium/700701.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=\"caption\"&gt;Transverse crevasse formation.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_24\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Marginal Crevasses&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;br&gt;Marginal crevasses form along the sides of a glacier due to the differential flow of the ice. Glaciers move faster in the center than at the edges, which are restrained by the stationary rock on the sides and beneath the shallower ice. This difference in flow rate causes shear in-line with the glacier flow, which causes tension to develop along 45o angles facing into the flow.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So in general, marginal crevasses form at the edges of a glacier at 45&lt;sup&gt;o&lt;/sup&gt; angles facing &lt;i&gt;into&lt;/i&gt; the flow. They can create barriers to entering and leaving a glacier, but routes can be planned through them so long as they cut diagonally onto the glacier in line with the crevasses. It is because of the continual development of marginal crevasses that routes usually travel down the center of the glacier, because crevasses there are more intermittent. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Also, keep in mind that the ice between the crevasses is under compression (remember the ice shear figure?), but may be in slender strips. This could leave those sections of the glacier prone to buckling and crushing, making even these sections impassable.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div align=\"center\" class=\"image\" style=\"width: 506px;\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"/marginal-crevasse-formation/700702\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Marginal crevasse formation.\" height=\"420\" width=\"500\" src=\"/images/medium/700702.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=\"caption\"&gt;Marginal crevasse formation.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_25\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Transverse Crescentric Crevasses&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;br&gt;Transverse crescentric crevasses are a blend of transverse and marginal crevasses and tend to form as a glacier rolls onto a steepening slope as it passes through a constriction. This bends the glacier over the rise while shearing the sides. The combination of these effects creates arc-shaped crevasses that usually span most of the length of the constriction. The arc is convex facing uphill and concave facing downhill.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div align=\"center\" class=\"image\" style=\"width: 344px;\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"/transverse-crescentric-crevasse-formation/700703\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Transverse crescentric crevasse formation.\" height=\"500\" width=\"338\" src=\"/images/medium/700703.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=\"caption\"&gt;Transverse crescentric crevasse formation.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_26\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Radial Crevasses&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;br&gt;Radial crevasses form on the outside curve of a glacier as it rounds a corner. This outside edge travels faster to keep up with the flow, subjecting these outer regions to tension, creating straight radial crevasses, perpendicular to the flow, but radiating out from towards the center of the bend, like spokes on a wheel. Glacier routes tend to hug the inside of a bend because this region is generally free of radial crevasses and may actually be subjected to compression as the flow is slowed down here.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div align=\"center\" class=\"image\" style=\"width: 506px;\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"/radial-crevasse-formation/700704\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Radial crevasse formation.\" height=\"341\" width=\"500\" src=\"/images/medium/700704.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=\"caption\"&gt;Radial crevasse formation.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_27\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Longitudinal Crevasses&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;br&gt;Longitudinal crevasses form parallel to the flow of the glacier. They may form as a glacier passes over a bulge or ridge in line with the glacier, but they usually form near the terminus of the glacier as the ice spreads out laterally and becomes shallower, making it more sensitive to the underlying terrain. Because they form in line with the fall line, they are usually less of a barrier to travel, but it is more difficult to travel safely around them as a roped team.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div align=\"center\" class=\"image\" style=\"width: 506px;\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"/longitudinal-crevasse-formation/700705\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Longitudinal crevasse formation.\" height=\"307\" width=\"500\" src=\"/images/medium/700705.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=\"caption\"&gt;Longitudinal crevasse formation.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_28\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Seracs &amp;amp; Icefalls&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;br&gt;When a glacier flows off of a cliff or a very steep rise, transverse crevasses become so severe that the ice actually separates from the glacier, forming free-standing  blocks of ice that may be as large as office buildings. These provide barriers to travel when they form in large numbers, often requiring technical ice climbing to pass through them. These areas are called icefalls and are the ice analogy of a waterfall.Seracs pose objective hazards to climbers as they tend to topple, crushing anything in their path, or starting ice avalanches. Serac fall is often unpredictable, although it is more prevalent with faster moving glaciers. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In summer as glaciers accelerate, the rate of serac fall may also accelerate, but this isn&rsquo;t always the case. Traveling around them at night might not be any safer than traveling around them in the day. However, the rate of collapse tends to be characteristic of a glacier, so the amount of hazard or the timing of serac collapse can be deduced by watching the glacier for a day or so and keeping track of the activity.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div align=\"center\" class=\"image\" style=\"width: 506px;\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"/approaching-the-ice-arch-in-the-2nd-icefall-on-the-whitney-glacier/618791\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Approaching the Ice Arch in the 2nd Icefall on the Whitney Glacier\" height=\"332\" width=\"500\" src=\"/images/medium/618791.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=\"caption\"&gt;Seracs on the Whitney Glacier (Mt Shasta, Cascades, CA)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;                  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_29\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Identifying Crevasses &amp;amp; Icefalls from Topographic Maps&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;br&gt;For safety, ease and speed of climbing, it is important to select good routes over glaciers. In general, routes should avoid climbing below or through icefalls, should enter and exit the glacier at strategic places, and to take a path of least resistance through the crevasses. Because of this, it is a good idea to scope out the glacier from a distance on the approach. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;You can also predict ahead of time where the easy and difficult sections or safe and dangerous sections are. Based on the concepts I discussed in the previous section on crevasses, moats, and bergschrunds, you should be able to draw a rudimentary crevassing pattern on a topographic map. For example, see the figure below of the topo map, how I&rsquo;d assume the crevasses are (and therefore where the easiest route goes), and a satellite photograph showing the actual state of the glacier.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div align=\"center\" class=\"image\" style=\"width: 506px;\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"/determining-crevasses-from-a-topo-map/700707\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Determining Crevasses from a Topo Map\" height=\"319\" width=\"500\" src=\"/images/medium/700707.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=\"caption\"&gt;Locations of seracs and typical crevasse types, with a standard line of travel shown. The crevasses were drawn &amp;amp; route selection theorized based purely off of the topographic map and confirmed once overlaid on a satellite photo.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_30\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Identifying Buried Crevasses on the Glacier&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When crevasses are buried under snow, it is important to spot them as soon as possible to make optimal route adjustments and avoid hazards. There are a number of ways to spot crevasses. In winter when there are no outward signs, the lead climber should regularly probe the snow with their ice axe or pole. Beyond this, there isn&rsquo;t much one can do.&lt;br&gt;&lt;div align=\"center\" class=\"image-right\" style=\"width: 506px;\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"/failing-snowbridges-and-meltwater-channels/475637\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Failing Snowbridges and Meltwater Channels\" height=\"375\" width=\"500\" src=\"/images/medium/475637.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=\"caption\"&gt;It can be difficult to distinguish meltwater channels from crevasses.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br&gt;In later season as the glacier begins to melt out, snow bridges begin to sag. Buried crevasses can be spotted by looking for these sagging snow bridges. Linear undulations in the glacier are a sign, especially if there is cracking in the snow surface. As this layer melts out and drops down, the troughs tend to fill with dirt and dust, darkening them. This can happen in drops too subtle to see without discoloration. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;However, keep in mind that these may not actually be signs of crevasses. In addition to just being chance features in the glacier, in later seasons melt channels form on the glacier surface, which can be confused with crevasses. Windblown snow can take the form of dunes across the glacier, creating ripples with dips similar to a sagging snow bridge. So how do you tell crevasses apart from these false-positives? &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If you know where to expect them ahead of time, and what sort of orientation they should have there, then you can more easily discern the appropriate patters. For example, meltwater channels fall down the fall line, so unless you are worried about the formation of longitudinal crevasses, sagging snow in this orientation is probably not an indicator of a crevasse.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Whenever the rope team gathers together, for food breaks or for making camp, it is important to ensure that there are no buried crevasses in the area. The lead climber should probe the area around them (ideally with an avalanche probe, as ski poles and ice axes cannot probe very deep) and the campsite then belay the climbers in. Probing can be used to determine safe zone boundaries within the camp where climbers can walk around un-roped. &lt;br&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_31\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Glacier Travel &amp;amp; Rescue (Diagrams)&lt;/h2&gt;In brief, below are some graphics I made for illustrating some aspects of glacier travel and rescue.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_32\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Basic Glacier Travel Techniques&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;noformat&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;table&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;div align=\"center\" class=\"image\" style=\"width: 206px;\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"/tie-in-lengths-for-glacier-travel/700710\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Tie-In Lengths for Glacier Travel\" height=\"82\" width=\"200\" src=\"/images/small/700710.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=\"caption\"&gt;Tie-In Lengths for Glacier Travel&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;div align=\"center\" class=\"image\" style=\"width: 206px;\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"/traveling-through-parallel-crevasses/700709\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Traveling Through Parallel Crevasses\" height=\"108\" width=\"200\" src=\"/images/small/700709.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=\"caption\"&gt;Traveling en-echelon while walking parallel to crevasses.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/noformat&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div align=\"center\" class=\"image\" style=\"width: 506px;\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"/end-running-a-crevasse/700708\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"End Running a Crevasse\" height=\"478\" width=\"500\" src=\"/images/medium/700708.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=\"caption\"&gt;End Running a Crevasse&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a name=\"chapter_33\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Self-Rescue for Crevasse Rescue&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div align=\"center\" class=\"image\" style=\"width: 506px;\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"/texas-kick/700715\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Texas Kick\" height=\"252\" width=\"500\" src=\"/images/medium/700715.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=\"caption\"&gt;Texas Kick - the standard way to ascend a rope.
