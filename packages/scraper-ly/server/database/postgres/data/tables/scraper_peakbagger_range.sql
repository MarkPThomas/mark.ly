However, one interesting way to look at world\'s ranges is that most of them form a semi-continuous chain similar to the seam on a baseball, winding around across continents and oceans.  <br><br><p>Starting at the Atlas Mountains of North Africa, this large mountainous area encompasses the mountains of Spain, the Pyrenees, the Alps, the Carpathians, and then the Balkan Ranges before crossing into Asia as the mountains of Turkey, the Caucasus, the Zagros, and the Elburz.  Moving out of Iran, the master chain becomes the great central Asian complex that includes the Karakoram, Hindu Kush, and Himalaya.  Mountainous terrain then continues northeastwards across China and Siberia to the Bering Strait, where the Aleutian and Alaska Ranges then merge into the great cordilleras of western North America, such as the Rockies, Coast Mountains, Cascade Range, and Sierra Nevada.  The spine of high mountains running south through Mexico and Central America is well-known, as are the great uninterrupted wall of the Andes.  The mountains then cross to Antarctica as the ranges of the Antarctic Peninsula and the Transantarctic Mountains, ending at the north coast of Victoria Land.<br><br><p>From this huge but indistinct master chain there are two huge offshoots to the south: one starting in the eastern Mediterranean and following the great Rift Valley and Ethiopian Highlands to the Drakensberg of South Africa; the other originiaing at the east end of the Himalaya and winding down through Southeast Asia, Indonesia, and the Great Dividing Range of Australia.<br><br><p>This extremely over-simplified scheme of great range systems is kind of silly, but it does includes major mountain systems on all continents and emphasizes the global continutity of the mountains and the tectonic plate boundaries that often form them.<br><br><h2>Mountain Heights on Earth</h2><p>There are only 14 peaks over 8000 meters high, all in the Himalaya or Karakoram Ranges of Asia.  In addition, all 7000 meter peaks in the world are located in those ranges and others in the great Central Asian complex--the Pamir, Tien Shan, Hindu Kush, Kunlun, and other ranges.  Outside of this area, 6000 meter peaks of the world are found only in the Andes (including Aconcagua at 6960 meters) and at Denali in Alaska.  Lowering the bar to 5000 meters, we find peaks in the Caucasus area, Elburz range of Iran, St. Elias Range, Central Mexico, East Africa, and New Guinea, plus countless lower peaks in the higher ranges.</p><br><table width=\"95%\" align=\"center\"><br><br><br><br><br><br></table>','The Solar System','yes',NULL),(2,'1','http://peakbagger.com/range.aspx?rid=1','North America',1,'Continent',40.7,-111.867,18144,16664,'<br><br><p>North America has an incredibly wide variety of mountains, including ice-covered giants worthy of the Himalaya, huge ranges of craggy rock pinnacles, gentle, rolling, forest-covered hills, and exotic volcanoes on small tropical islands.

The Eurasian landmass is so huge and dwarfs all the other continents so much that chopping it up helps equalize things a little bit.

Even the huge expanse of Siberia, with its wide, flat basins, has a lifetime\'s worth of decent mountain ranges hidden in its vastness.<br><br><p>I think it is difficult for most Europeans and North Americans to grasp just how big Asia is and how many mountains it contains.  We grow very comfortable with the well-mapped confines of the Alps and the Rockies, totally unaware of the sheer scale and sheer number of virtually unknown and unexplored ranges that sprawl across Siberia, China, and Central Asia.  To fully grasp the mountains of Asia requires us to increase our geographic concepts an entire order of magnitude.

This limitation was rarely a problem as I divided up the world into its logical range components.  North America needed all 10 subranges to work, but most other continents divided nicely into 9 or fewer Range2s.  For Asia, though, I was forced to artificially divide it into 2 pseudo-continents, and even then I needed all 20 slots for sub ranges.  Indeed, I think that the ideal and correct number of Range2s in Asia might be between 21 and 25.  Every Range2 I created was usually the full equal of Range2s like the Rockies or Alps.<br><br><p>So, enjoy exploring Asia--in every sense of the word, the heart of the world\'s mountains.<br><br><table width=\"95%\" align=\"center\"></table>','The World','yes',NULL),(6,'6','http://peakbagger.com/range.aspx?rid=6','Africa',1,'Continent',0.716667,28.3333,4887,7496,'<br><p>Africa, after Asia the second largest continent, has surprisingly few major mountains and ranges.

The southern limit of what are usually called the Rockies is where the San Juan and Sangre de Cristo Ranges peter out in central New Mexico.<br><br><p>The Rockies are fairly high in the world scheme of things, about as high as the Alps, the Atlas Mountains of Morocco, and the Zagros Mountains of Iran and Iraq, all in the 14,000\'/4500m range.  However, the Rockies are far from any ocean, and rise from plains and deserts at elevations of about 4,000 to 8,000 feet, lowering considerably the local relief.  The Canadian Rockies are lower than the ranges south of 49°, with only three summits over 12,000\', but they are still more impressive in appearance due to more glaciation and steeper slopes.</p><p>Generally speaking, the U.S. Rockies are exceptionally gentle, rounded, easily climbed peaks, especially in light of their great height.  There are precious few Rocky Mountain summits that offer the scenic grandeur and rugged craggieness of, say, the Alps--the Teton Range in Wyoming, the Crestones in Colorado, and the Sawtooths in Idaho come to mind, but little else.  From a distance, especially from the expansive flatlands of the Great Plains, the Rockies look very impressive and pointy, but perhaps only twenty major summits in the entire range require any technical mountaineering skills or gear whatsoever.  Mount Elbert (14,433\'), the highest peak in all the Rockies, is so gentle people have ridden bicycles to its summit.</p><p>Similarly, the U.S. Rockies are not a very snowy range--there are a few small glaciers in Montana and Wyoming, and snowfields can be found on all the higher peaks at any time, but in general these are not snowcapped mountains, since from July to September virtually any peak can be climbed without having to deal with any snow.</p><p>Finally, the Rockies in the United States are not a single, uniterruppted mountain wall.  Instead, they are a collection of about a hundred separate ranges spread out over six states, often with wide gaps and plains between individual ranges.  The term \"The Rockies\" is so broad that in any local context it is virtually meaningless.  Trying to make sense of all the individual ranges can be very confusing, as they are spread out over a huge area and often are completely separated from other nearby ranges, even though they are all part of the Rockies.  Browsing through the range hierarchy on this site can help you figure it all out.</p><table width=\"95%\" align=\"center\"><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br></table>','North America','yes',NULL),(14,'15','http://peakbagger.com/range.aspx?rid=15','North America Plains',2,'Miscellaneous physical or political Feature',48.2,-95.4667,3094,3681,'<br><p>While North America has more than its share of the world\'s scenic and spectacular mountain ranges, at the same time it also holds a huge chunk of expansive plains and lowlands.  The North America Interior Range2 was created to hold together the enormous chunk of largely non-mountainous terrain between the Rocky Mountains and the Appalachians, and from the Arctic Ocean to the Gulf of Mexico.<br><br><p>Contrary to the belief of many east and west coast mountain snobs, the country between the Rockies and the Appalachians is not \"flat\".  Truly flat land--land with no topography to speak of--is not as common as most people think.  You find it on the Atlantic seaboard south from New Jersey; most of Florida; the entire Gulf Coast; and areas in the Mississippi River valley north to Cairo, IL.  Some parts of the great plains, such as the Llano Estacado in Texas and New Mexico, also qualify.  Anyone familiar with the Delmarva Peninsula, the Everglades, Louisana\'s bayous, or the Mississippi Delta country knows the real meaning of the term \"flatlands\". <br><br><p>Most of the rest of North America from the Rockies to the Appalachians can best be called hilly.  This includes most of the Midwest, from the High Plains of the Dakotas all the way to Ohio and Kentucky.  It\'s fashionable to deride the Midwest as being flat, but there are plenty of little ski areas, scenic river gorges, and rolling farmland, even in places like Iowa and Kansas.  Similarly, the vast Canadian Shield is also covered with uncountable little rocky hills.<br><br><p>While there there are no large ranges of snow-capped or jagged peaks in this huge area, there are certainly plenty of little ranges, highland areas, and hills.  The Torngat Mountains of Labrador, the Adirondacks of New York State (which are not Appalachians), the Ozark Highlands of the mid-South, the Black Hills of South Dakota, and the diseccted mesas and badlands of the High Plains are all worthy little pockets of peaks.<br><br><p>Chances are that you have not heard of <a href=\"peak.aspx?pid=6320\">Fishers Peak</a>, a 9627 feet summit in Colorado that I am calling the highest point of this area.  Conventional wisdom gives <a href=\"peak.aspx?pid=6236\">Harney Peak</a>, the 7242\' foot high point of the Black Hills, the title of highest peak east of the Rockies.  However, you can make a very logical and persuasive argument that I-25 and Raton Pass are the eastern edge of the Rocky Mountains in the Colorado-New Mexico area.  If that is the case, then the extensive highland east of Raton Pass, including Fishers Peak and several other 8000-foot summits that extend east towards Oklahoma, is part of the Interior North America Range2.<table width=\"95%\" align=\"center\"></table>','North America','yes',NULL),(15,'16','http://peakbagger.com/range.aspx?rid=16','Appalachian Mountains',2,'Mountain range with well-recognized name',37.1,-76.3,1896,2114,'<br><p>Among the world\'s great mountain ranges, the Appalachian Mountains are pretty undistinguished.  Mostly low and gentle, some would hesitate to call them \"mountains\".  They may seem high to the lowlanders who thicky populate their base, but they are no match to the lofty, snowy peaks of the Himalaya, Andes, or Alps.  Instead, the Appalachians are roughly equal in height to mountains few have heard of, such as the Yablonovy Range of eastern Siberia (high point of 8862\') or the Mtumba Range in Malawi, Africa (high point of 8071\').  And, they approximate the ruggedness of low ranges like the Russian Urals or the Ghats in India.  Those from western North America, especially those from Colorado, love to point out that most of the High Plains, at the base of the Rockies, are as high or higher than most major Appalachian summits.</p><p>Despite barely registering on any list of the major mountain ranges of the world, the Appalachians are still important for three main reasons.  First, they cover a huge, almost unbroken area, over 1500 miles long and often a couple hundred miles wide.  Second, they are the only significant topography in all of eastern North America, a huge, otherwise flat expanse.  Finally, despite large areas that are little more than gentle hills, the base-to-summit rise and ruggedness of a few sections of the Appalachians can be impressive.  For example, the vertical gain of the standard hike up New Hampshire\'s <a href=\"peak.aspx?pid=6954\">Mount Adams</a> (5798\') is greater than that for Colorado\'s <a href=\"peak.aspx?pid=5736\">Mount Elbert</a> (14,433\'), highest peak in the Rockies.  And try telling anyone who has hiked Katahdin\'s Knife Edge, the Appalachian Trail through the Mahoosucs, or the crest of Grandfather Mountain on the Blue Ridge that the Appalachians are gentle, easy, unchallenging hills.</p><p>After their relative lack of height and ruggedness, the most important characteristic of the Appalachians when compared to mountains in western North America is their extensive forest.  With only a few minor scattered exceptions, the entire range of the Appalachian Mountains is cloaked in deep, thick, dense forest.  To the north, and at higher elevations, a dark, humid evergreen forest of spruce and fir covers the mountains, while further south and lower down a more open broadleaf mix of birch, oak, and beech predominates.</p><p>There are a few places in the Appalachians not covered with trees: the high peaks of the Northern Appalachians, where the combination of both high altitude and latitude keeps a few small and widely scattered areas above timberline, and \"Balds\" in the south where, mysteriously, huge open meadows cover summits that should be forested.  These rare places, plus a bunch of open summit ledges, are the scenic gems of the entire Appalachians.</p><p>For the majority of the range, though, the extensive, thick Appalachian forest has two major consequences for people who travel in the mountains.  First, the trees are always blocking views.  Only on the rare rocky summits <br>are any wide-open views available, and often times a hiker can go all day, climbing over several peaks, without seeing much beyond the floor of the forest.  This situation improves markedly in winter, when the deciduous trees are bare, but the kind of wide open vistas that are almost constant out west are extremely rare.</p><p>Second, the forest means that hiking trails become far more important.  Bushwhacking, away from established trails, is generally miserable, slow work slogging through thick bushes and closely spaced trees.  Also, perversely, the going gets more difficult the higher up you get, since the evergreens and harsh climate of higher elevations combine to form dense, gnarled thickets that are all but impossible to penetrate without a trail or a chainsaw.  This contrasts markedly with most of the west, where the sparse forests and wide-open above-timberline terrain allow the hiker to go pretty much wherever he pleases without worrying too much about trails.</p><p>The quintessential Appalachian experience involves a trail: hiking 2000 miles from Georgia to Maine along the Appalachian Trail, the world\'s first and most famous long-distance footpath.  Every spring hundreds of people start out at Springer Mountain, and by fall considerably fewer arrive at Mount Katahdin, but those who stick with it are rewarded not only with pleasant woodsy walking for several months, but become part of a fascinating subculture, a sort of linear new-age village.  Individual through-hikers adopt nicknames, leave messages for each other at shelters, form and disband hiking parties, and share an increasing camaraderie among themselves as Katahdin draws nearer.  These hardy souls replenish their stocks of food and sometimes get an occasional motel room at small oasis villages on the A.T. that have become somewhat famous as through hiker havens--Damascus, VA and Monson, ME are among the most famous.  The truly hard core through-hikers have even done the trail two, three, or more times.</p><p>However, it should be noted that despite the popularity of through hiking, the A.T. is hardly the most scenic or spectacular place to spend several months in the mountains.  Most of the trail through the Mid-Atlantic <br>states is pretty boring, and even in the South and in New England many endless, forested, viewless miles of rocky trail can be a drag.  Also, although the A.T. does an excellent job of threading together the best of the Appalachians, some of the most spectacular peaks aren\'t even on the trail, such as Grandfather Mountain, Old Rag, the Seneca Rocks, the Adirondacks, the Catskills, Mt. Mansfield, and the Grand Monadnock.  Of course, a through-hiker might argue that the time spent slogging through hot forests only makes the trail\'s highlights--Roan Mountain, Shenandoah National Park, the Presidentials, Katahdin, and many others--seem that much better.</p><p>Books about the Appalachian Trail could fill a large bookshelf, and reading one of the many accounts of a trail journey will tell you pretty much all you need to know about this bizarre adventure unique to the Appalachians.</p><p>Dividing the Appalachians up into sections is complicated by the virtually continuous nature of the range.  The only flat route through the entire chain is via the canyon of the Hudson River, which slices right through an otherwise continuously hilly region.  The main topographic divider of the entire range is the Appalachian Valley, a 1500-mile long trench running from Canada to Alabama.  To the southeast of this valley are the Canadian Appalachians, the Northern U.S. Appalachians, and the great Blue Ridge complex.  Northwest of the Appalachian Valley we find two huge but similar areas that geologists call the Appalachian Ridges and Appalachian Plateaus.<br><br><p>Therefore the terms \"Southern Appalachians\" and \"Central Appalachians\" are somewhat imprecise, since there is no natural east-west break in the mountain mass that runs from New York to Alabama.  The Southern Appalachians are often said to begin south of the Potomac River, and the Central Appalachians could be defined as those of New York and Pennsylvania.</p><table width=\"95%\" align=\"center\"><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br></table>','North America','yes',NULL),(16,'17','http://peakbagger.com/range.aspx?rid=17','Central Mexican Ranges',2,'Bogus mountain grouping for this site',23.7167,-102.517,1114,1053,'<br><p>The Central Mexican Ranges are essentially the various Sierra Madre ranges of Mexico, the high central volcanoes, and the high plateaus they surround.

composed of two principal islands, imaginatively called the North and South Islands.  They both have impressive mountains, but the difference between the peaks on the two islands is striking.</p><h4>The North Island</h4><p>The North Island is dominated topographically by large volcanic cones looming over the landscape.  The highest is recently-erupted (1996) <a href=\"peak.aspx?pid=11667\">Mt. Ruapehu</a> (9177\'/2797m), in the center of the North Island, and two lower peaks to the north, Mt. Ngauruhoe (7516\'/2291m) and Mt. Tongariro (6457\'/1968\') are part of the same range.  All three volcanos are part of Tongariro National Park, and Ruapehu offers skiing at two areas on its slopes, as long as there is no threat of lava flowing down onto skiers.</p><p>On an bulge on the North Island\'s west coast lies another volcano, <a href=\"peak.aspx?pid=11670\">Mt. Taranaki</a> (8261\'/2518m).  Also called Mt. Egmont, it is the second highest peak on the island and an alomst perfect cone in the tradition of Mt. Fuji.</p><h4>The South Island</h4><p>In contrat to the volcanoes of the north, the South Island\'s backbone is the high and rugged Southern Alps, among the most impressive and difficult mountains in the world.  Although not high by world standards, the range rises almost from sea level and gets hammered by terrible weather all year, resulting in massive snowfalls and extensive glaciers.  The western slopes of the Southern Alps are the only place in the world where glaciers descend into the heart of temperate rainforest.</p><p>The highest point in the Southern Alps and all New Zealand is <a href=\"peak.aspx?pid=11737\">Mt. Cook</a> (12,316\'/3754m), but several other peaks nearby rise over 3000m, and Mt. Aspring, well to the south, is a <br>\"Matterhorn\"-type peak that is just as impressive.  Mountaineering in this range is in many ways as challenging as any in the world--extreme paitience is needed to wait out the terrible weather, and the steep, glacier-gouged slopes and their continuous avalanches bar easy access to any major summit.  After all, Sir Edmund Hillary learned his craft here.</p><p>The Southen Alps overshadow the other ranges in the eastern parts of the South Island, but they can still be impressive.  For example, Tapuaenuku (9465\'/2885m), in the Inland Kaikoura Range, is still higher than any peak on the North Island.  The Kaikoura Ranges, the \"Remarkables\" series of crags near Queenstown, and other ranges of the sheep-farming country of the eastern South Island are all as dry as the Southern Alps are wet--Mt. Cook and company wring all the moisture out of the wet air attacking the Westland, producing an example of a dramatic rain shadow.</p><table width=\"95%\" align=\"center\"><br><br><br><br><br><br> <br><br><br><br><br><br> <br><br> </table>','Australia-Oceania','yes',NULL),(65,'74','http://peakbagger.com/range.aspx?rid=74','Micronesia',2,'Archipelago',13.45,144.783,1850,3054,'','Australia-Oceania','yes',NULL),(66,'75','http://peakbagger.com/range.aspx?rid=75','Melanesia',2,'Archipelago',-5.21667,151.533,1476,24316,'','Australia-Oceania','yes',NULL),(67,'76','http://peakbagger.com/range.aspx?rid=76','Polynesia',2,'Archipelago',19.5833,-155.433,3443,4274,'','Australia-Oceania','yes',NULL),(68,'80','http://peakbagger.com/range.aspx?rid=80','West Antarctica Ranges',2,'Bogus mountain grouping for this site',-74.2667,-100.667,1712,2965,'','Antarctica','yes',NULL),(69,'81','http://peakbagger.com/range.aspx?rid=81','Transantarctic Mountains',2,'Mountain range with well-recognized name',-84.5,-112.383,1246,5080,'','Antarctica','yes',NULL),(70,'82','http://peakbagger.com/range.aspx?rid=82','East Antarctica Ranges',2,'Bogus mountain grouping for this site',-77.6167,0.0666667,1714,5359,'','Antarctica','yes',NULL),(71,'100','http://peakbagger.com/range.aspx?rid=100','Brooks Range',3,'Mountain range with well-recognized name',68.9333,-151.917,332,741,'','Alaska-Yukon Ranges','yes',NULL),(72,'101','http://peakbagger.com/range.aspx?rid=101','Alaska Intermountain Ranges',3,'Bogus mountain grouping for this site',62.8,-140.817,737,1098,'','Alaska-Yukon Ranges','yes',NULL),(73,'102','http://peakbagger.com/range.aspx?rid=102','Alaska Range',3,'Mountain range with well-recognized name',62.9,-149.85,276,435,'','Alaska-Yukon Ranges','yes',NULL),(74,'103','http://peakbagger.com/range.aspx?rid=103','Aleutian Ranges',3,'Mountain range with well-recognized name',58,-157.55,691,13782,'','Alaska-Yukon Ranges','yes',NULL),(75,'104','http://peakbagger.com/range.aspx?rid=104','South-Central Alaska',3,'Bogus mountain grouping for this site',61.2667,-146.233,527,571,'','Alaska-Yukon Ranges','yes',NULL),(76,'105','http://peakbagger.com/range.aspx?rid=105','Saint Elias Mountains',3,'Mountain range with well-recognized name',60.1,-139.1,263,280,'','Alaska-Yukon Ranges','yes',NULL),(77,'106','http://peakbagger.com/range.aspx?rid=106','Yukon Intermountain Ranges',3,'Bogus mountain grouping for this site',64.0333,-137.233,743,495,'','Alaska-Yukon Ranges','yes',NULL),(78,'107','http://peakbagger.com/range.aspx?rid=107','Mackenzie Mountains',3,'Mountain range with well-recognized name',63.5,-129.217,582,494,'','Alaska-Yukon Ranges','yes',NULL),(79,'110','http://peakbagger.com/range.aspx?rid=110','Queen Elizabeth Islands',3,'Archipelago',79.6167,-76.55,601,833,'','North America Arctic Islands','yes',NULL),(80,'111','http://peakbagger.com/range.aspx?rid=111','South Canadian Arctic Islands',3,'Archipelago',70.9167,-109.983,896,1359,'','North America Arctic Islands','yes',NULL),(81,'112','http://peakbagger.com/range.aspx?rid=112','Baffin Island',3,'Island',67.8667,-65.2167,867,760,'','North America Arctic Islands','yes',NULL),(82,'113','http://peakbagger.com/range.aspx?rid=113','Greenland',3,'Island',71.8,-42.1833,1647,1338,'','North America Arctic Islands','yes',NULL),(83,'120','http://peakbagger.com/range.aspx?rid=120','Northwest Coast Islands',3,'Archipelago',49.6,-125.85,733,588,'','Pacific Ranges','yes',NULL),(84,'121','http://peakbagger.com/range.aspx?rid=121','Coast Mountains',3,'Mountain range with well-recognized name',54.9833,-129.383,812,632,'','Pacific Ranges','yes',NULL),(85,'122','http://peakbagger.com/range.aspx?rid=122','Northwest U.S. Coast Ranges',3,'Bogus mountain grouping for this site',43.1,-123.9,730,163,'<br><p>The Northwest Coast Ranges have very clear boundaries.

The Colorado Mountain Club officially dubs 54 peaks as \"fourteeners\", but, as with any list of mountains, there is controversy over what sub-peaks and offshoot summits count as separate official peaks.  Some advice: decide on consistent criteria (for example, a 200-foot gain from a col with another summit) and make up your own list, or just select peaks that appeal to you in some way.</p><p>Nevertheless, the list of fourteeners is indeed an impressive catalog of summits, ranging from the famous (<a href=\"peak.aspx?pid=5689\">Pikes Peak</a>-14,410\') to the challenging (<a href=\"peak.aspx?pid=5642\">Longs <br>Peak</a>-14,256\') to the high (<a href=\"peak.aspx?pid=5689.htm\">Mount Elbert</a>-14,433\') to the obscure (<a href=\"peak.aspx?pid=5803\">Mount Sherman</a>-14,015\').  Most fourteeners are easy climbs, often just hikes.  Only about ten or so, including those in the Crestone area in the Sangre de Cristo Mountains, the Wilsons in the San Juans, and summits in the Elk Mountains, require anything more than walking to gain the summit.  The hardest don\'t even require a rope if the climbers are good and careful scamblers, and two (Pikes Peak and Mount Evans) have good auto roads to their tops.</p><p>With so much attention having been devoted to the fourteeners, more and more people are discovering the Colorado \"thirteeners\" (13,000 foot peaks), many of which offer just as much as their slightly higher but more popular and famous neighbors.  There are, by one count, 583 thirteeners spread out among the state\'s ranges, so climbing all of them is much more of a long-term, open-ended challenge than following the masses to the summits of fourteeners.  And Colorado has plenty of 12,000 footers or 11,000 footers that would be dominant and spectacular if they were located in any other state.

There may not be any timberline, but the summits of many \"Balds\" in the Blue Ridge area are open meadows with often fine views.  There are pockets of <br>rugged, challenging terrain, and even a few peaks with rocky ledges at the summits that poke above the trees and provide spectacular mountain settings--Old Rag-3268 in Virginia and Grandfather Mountain-5984 in North Carolina come to mind. <br><br><p>The lack of challenging monster mountains isn\'t necessarily a drawback, either.  The many high roads in this area, plus the gentle slopes and often short walks to summits from high trailheads, make the Blue Ridge an excellent place for mountain explorers who don\'t go for backpacking, rugged scrambling, or rock-climbing.  A family or retired couple in their car doing easy dayhikes can spend huge amounts of time in the highest country in the east without ever getting a mile away from a car.  Also, mountains need not present sheer, craggy faces to impress; the Blue Ridge charms with its endless waves of green hillsides, its incredibly diverse flora and fauna in its damp forests, its haunting blue morning mists (which gave the Blue Ridge and the Great Smokies their names), and the fascinating Appalachian culture of the long-time residents.  Some of the mountain folk, isolated in their deep mountain hollows, speak English so similar to the Elizabethan dialect of the 1600s that it has interested Shakespearean scholars.<br><br><p>The very high average height of the southern Blue Ridge region gives it a climate that most people do not associate with the south.  Winter snows can be heavy, and even spring blizzards can happen, as A.T. through-hikers getting an early start in April in Georgia sometimes find out.  The area has the greatest rainfall in the contiguous U.S. outside of the Pacific Northwest, and is also much cooler and less humid than the surrounding lowlands.  Asheville, NC, the large city in the center of the southern Blue Ridge Complex, has been rated as having one of the most pleasant climates, due to more bearable summers than in, say, Atlanta, with more bearable winters than found in places like New England.  This pattern is less true for the northern Blue Ridge in Virginia, with its much lower elevations and much narrower mountain mass.<br><br><p>North of Roanoke, VA, the Blue Ridge is pretty much a single mountain crest.  South of Roanoke, it startes expanding into a huge, wide, confusing oval of ranges and ridges that extends all the way into Georgia.  To make sense of the entire complex, it has been divided into 4 sections: first,the Northern Blue Ridge, the single ridge north of Roanoke; second, the Southern Blue Ridge Front, which forms the eastern and southern edges of the large southern oval; third, the massive Great Smoky Mountains; fourth, the Western Blue Ridge Ranges, which are the other ranges at the western edge of the oval excepting the Smokies; and fifth and finally, the Central Blue Ridge Ranges, the jumble in the middle of the oval, which includes the Black Mountains and its high point, <a href=\"peak.aspx?pid=7822\"> Mt.

Down low the nearly continuous rain supports lush temprate rain forests that blanket the western and southern slopes of the mountains, and up higher the massive amounts of snowfall create the large glaciers and snowfields that give the Olympics their awesome alpine character.</p><p>Before you write off a trip to the Olympics because you don\'t like being fogbound and miserably wet, bear in mind that although winter can sometimes mean solid months without sun, there are often week-long stretches during the summer when hot, humid weather and clear blue skies settle in.  During these times the Olympics are a delight--the views of the Pacific Ocean, the strait of Juan de Fuca, Puget Sound, Vancouver Island, and the Cascade Range are devastating.

The massive volcanos of the more southern reaches of the Cascade Range, such as Mounts Rainier, Adams, Hood, and Shasta, are far higher and have larger glaciers, but they stand alone, isolated from each other by large areas of relatively flat forest.  The North Cascades, though, are mostly non-volcanic, and form a extremely rugged, difficult, remote, and challenging mass of glaciated alpine mountains.<br><br><p>This site uses Stevens Pass and U.S. 2 as the southern border of the North Cascades, but sometimes Snoqualmie Pass and I-90 further south are used as the divider.  The Fraser River in Canada is the clear northern border, and the Columbia and Okanogan Rivers form the eastern edge of the area.  To the northeast, the North Cascades merge indistinctly into the plateaus of British Colubmia, well beyond the point where the mountains have become low and unimpressive.<br><br><p>The North Cascades get massive amounts of precipitation, giving them an abundance of crevassed glaciers and jagged, ice-carved faces, but also deep, jungly rainforest on the lower slopes.  Climbing a major North Cascades summit often means a miserable bushwhack though deep undergrowth, followed by alpine challenge on the ice above.  Good trails get hikers and climbers through the forest to timberline on most popular routes, but approaches are still long and the weather is usually unsettled.<br><br><p>Mount Baker and Glacier Peak are the only 10,000-foot summits in the North Cascades, the only volcanoes, and the most popular and easy to climb major summits.  The remainder of the range bears little resemblance to the two highest peaks; the seven or so peaks in the 9,000 to 10,000 foot range are primarily a fearsome group of jagged monsters that require solid technical climbing ability.

quite possibly the single most dominant range of the hundred or so that make up the Rockies in the United States.  Exceptionally long, wide, high, rugged, and remote, the Winds (as they are affectionately known) are little known outside of the hiking and mountaineering communities, but to many they are clearly the quintessential Rocky mountain range.</p><p>The Wind River Mountains run for 90 miles in a straight line due northwest-southeast in west-central Wyoming.  They are only connected to other mountains at their northwest end, and all along their length they rise directly from expansive flatlands.  The Continental Divide runs along the entire crest of the range.</p><p>One of the most striking thing about the Winds is their remoteness.  No roads cross the range, and in most places the crest is over twenty miles from the nearest trailhead.  There are no National Parks or famous landmarks to draw the hordes of tourists that descend on nearby Yellowstone, so even though parts of the range can be somewhat crowded with backpackers and climbers in summer, there are almost no casual tourists or R.V. campers clogging the very few roads and towns.</p><p>The Winds are also the highest range in the Rockies outside of Colorado, with about 40 peaks over 13,000 feet, including <a href=\"peak.aspx?pid=5352\">Gannett Peak</a> (13,804\'), Wyoming\'s highest.  Unlike the Colorado ranges, the Winds, owing to their more northerly location, harbor extensive glaciers, especially in the northern part of the range, where all but one of the thirteeners rise.

However, despite its official status, this name has little currency among travellers and mapmakers, probably because the Appalachian Mountains in Maine are, at best, an irregular, disconnected, random series of ranges, ridges, and peaks.  Indeed, topographically and geologically, the Longfellows are just the less concentrated northeastern extension of New Hampshire\'s White Mountains, and the boundary between the two ranges is not clear.  For example, this site considers the state line-straddling Mahoosuc Range part of the Whites, which not everybody does.</p><p>However, even though the Longfellow Mountains might not really exist, there are still some truly fantastic peaks scattered throughout northern Maine.  <a href=\"peak.aspx?pid=6820\">Katahdin</a> (5267\') is probably the most awesome single peak in the eastern United States, the ridges of <br><a href=\"peak.aspx?pid=6829\">Bigelow</a>, <br><a href=\"peak.aspx?pid=6844\">Abraham</a>, and <br><a href=\"peak.aspx?pid=6848\">Saddleback</a> are among the <br>finest in the northeast, and countless other summits lie hidden in the deep north woods that blanket the most-forested state in the nation.</p><p>The principal distinguishing feature of Maine\'s mountains is their remoteness.  Maine is as big as the rest of New England put together, and many people driving, for example, from New York to, say, Katahdin, discover that Maine is not a state that you can just buzz across in a couple hours.  You will meet plenty of other outdoorsmen here on a summer weekend, but not nearly as many as in the White Mountains or Adirondacks.</p><p>Another big difference between the Longfellows and practically every other range in the country is a relative lack of public ownership.  There is  no federal land--National Parks or Forests--to speak of here (Acadia National Park is out on Maine\'s Atlantic coast), and the only sizeable protected area is Baxter State Park surrounding Katahdin.  There are many \"Maine public reserves\" on the higher summits, but most of the gigantic Maine north woods is owned by paper companies.  Access is not really a problem, though.  As long as you stay away from logging operations and don\'t mind the occasional sound of chainsaws through the forest, an outdoorsman can pretty much go wherever he wants.  The Appalachian Trail, for example, is fairly well-protected.</p><p>Many people familiar with timberline in the Whites or Adirondacks may scoff at the elevations of some of Maine\'s mountains, but their northern position lowers timberline to sometimes as low as 3500 feet, as on <a href=\"peak.aspx?pid=6865\">Baldpate Mountain</a> (3812\'), well above timberline.  This peak, plus Katahdin, Saddleback, Abraham, and Bigelow, together have above-timberline acreage that exceeds what is found in the Adirondacks.</p><p>The views from these open summits, plus the many, many others crowned with fire towers, are unique, alluring, and one of the great attractions of Maine\'s mountains.  The incredible number of lakes of Maine\'s north woods, <br>ranging in size from huge Moosehead Lake to thousands of little ponds, all scattered on the deep evergreen forests, produce an effect that Thoreau likened to a shattered mirror as he gazed out from Katahdin.  And since many of Maine\'s peaks are isolated and not part of a range, the view from any one is often of a huge expanse of flat or rolling green countryside, dark blue lakes, and other monadnocks rising in the distance.  The view of Katahdin from nearby mountains is especailly awesome.</p><p>Maine, being deep north woods country, suffers from severe swarms of insects, especially in spring and early summer, much like in the upper Midwest.  Moose range throughout the Longfellows, and you will undoubtedly see one if you spend any time at all in these mountains.  For those willing to travel the few extra hours to seek out these outstanding peaks, the rewards are well worth the extra time.</p><p>Please note that the isolated monadnocks of the Maine lowland, including the peaks of Acadia National Park, are covered as part of the <a href=\"range.aspx?rid=1610\">New England Upland</a> range.</p><table width=\"95%\" align=\"center\"><br><br> <br><br> <br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br> <br><br> </table>','Northern U.S. Appalachians','yes',NULL),(596,'1612','http://peakbagger.com/range.aspx?rid=1612','White Mountains',4,'Mountain range with well-recognized name',44.4,-71.4333,97,66,'<br><p>Quite simply, the White Mountains of New Hampshire are the premier <br>mountain range of the eastern United States.  Katahdin may be more awesome <br>than any single White Mountain peak, the Southern Appalachians may be higher, and the Adirondacks may be wilder and more rugged, but the White Mountains alone have the combination of height, ruggedness, scenery, and especially extent that makes them the premier range of mountains east of the Rockies.<br><br><p>The most compelling attraction of the White Mountains is their large <br>areas that lie above timberline.  While high peaks in the Adirondacks, in <br>Maine, and even Vermont poke through the trees to varying extents, only in the Presidential and Franconia Ranges of the White Mountains will you find huge, wide-open areas of ridgetop above the dense canopy of trees that blankets virtually all other mountains east of the Mississippi.  The relatively low timberline in the Whites, about 4800 feet or so, is due to a combination of altitude and latitude; all higher Appalachian summits are further south, giving the Whites the highest timberline-to-summit differential in the east.<br><br><p>The Presidential Range, featuring famed Mount Washington, is hands down the highest, most scenic, most visited, and most famous of the many ranges that make up the White Mountains, but the Franconia Region is not far behind, conceding only in the category of acreage above timberline.  Surrounding these two central areas are peripheral ranges that, while lower and less interesting than the Presidentials or Franconia area, are still extremely worthwhile in the context of eastern mountains.  The Carter Range, for example, would be the dominant mountain group in Vermont if it were to be moved west fifty miles.<br><br><p>The White Mountains are a popular vacation destination for millions.  Most are content to use the campgrounds on the scenic Kancamangus Highway, ride the cog railway or drive up Mt. Washington, marvel at the geologic wonders of Franconia notch, or visit the Story Land and Six-Gun City theme parks, but the backcountry is still more crowded than most of the rest of New England.  Camping regulations are strict, and a chain of eight mountain huts operated by the Appalachian Mountain Club is wildly popular with those who don\'t bring their own tent, sleeping bag, or food.<table width=\"95%\" align=\"center\"></table>','Northern U.S. Appalachians','yes',NULL),(597,'1613','http://peakbagger.com/range.aspx?rid=1613','Green Mountains',4,'Mountain range with well-recognized name',44.1167,-73.0167,221,77,'<br><p>The Green Mountains dominate Vermont, and Vermont dominates the Green Mountains.  No other state and mountain range have such a close, symbiotic relationship--the word Vermont is even a French contraction for \"green mountain\".  A long, straight range of gentle, rounded peaks running for 155 miles from Quebec to Massachusetts, the Greens are not as high or rugged as the White Mountains to the east or the Adirondacks to the west, but no one really minds, since the Green Mountains\' rolling, forested hillsides provide the perfect backdrop for Vermont\'s picture-postcard rural villages.  They also serve as ideal terrain for easy long-distance hiking on the Long Trail, downhill skiing at a huge array of first-class resorts, and driving hundreds of miles of soothing country roads, especially in autumn when the mountain\'s namesake green turns into an incredible display of reds, oranges, and yellows.</p><p>Although basically a range of rolling swells of forest, there are a few spots in the Green Mountains where the summits rise above the trees as impressive peaks, most notaby, by far, at Mount Mansfield (4393\').  Four other mountains rise above 4000 feet, and although their above-timberline area is miniscule, they still provide fine hiking objectives and excellent scenery in the overall context of the Appalachians; compared with most of the Southern Appalachians, for example, the Greens and their relatively low timberline look pretty impressive.  And unlike the nearby Adirondacks and White Mountains, the Green Mountains remain relatively high much further south.  Killington Peak (4241\') is the southernmost 4000 footer in New England, and 3500 footers are found right up to the Vermont\'s southern boundary, a latitude at which the both the Adirondacks and Whites have disappeared entirely, making these peaks much more accessible to the huge populations in the Mid-Atlantic area.</p><p>The backbone of the Green Mountains is the Long Trail, a 270-mile footpath running the entire length of the chain from Quebec to Massachusetts, climbing over virtually every major summit.  The Appalachian Trail uses the southern half of the Long Trail before, leaving it to head towards New Hampshire just north of Killington Peak.  Hiking the entire Long Trail, a trip of about three or four weeks, is an alternative to through-hiking the A.T. for those who can\'t take off four to six months or would enjoy a slower-paced, smaller-scale, yet somewhat similar adventure.</p><p>Despite the excellent hiking and backpacking opportunities on the Long Trail, skiing is the reason most people visit the Green Mountains.  The major ski areas of the state--from north to south: Jay, Stowe, Sugarbush, Killington, Okemo, Stratton, and Mount Snow--present a formidable lineup of the finest downhilling in the east.  This is in large part due to the Greens\' mountainous yet gentle terrain, which is not as steep or craggy as in the Adirondacks or White Mountains, making it perfect for the masses seeking long but easy runs.  The southern Vermont resorts also benefit from closeness to large cities like New York, while the northern Green Mountains receive heavy \"Champlain Powder\" snowfall from clouds that have passed over the Great Lakes (Lake Champlain itself is too small to generate much lake-effect snow).  However, before any of you western skiers get too excited, please realize that Vermont skiing is still eastern, meaning that man-made snow, icy conditions, relatively narrow trails, and bitter midwinter cold are all frequent hazards.  Still, the northern Green Mountains may be your best bet in the east for western-style powder skiing.</p><p>Cross country skiing is also very popular in the rolling foothills of the Green Mountains, and the now-complete (as of 2008) Catamount Trail, roughly paralleling the Long Trail from one end of the state to the other, is perhaps the premier long-distance skiing trail on the east coast.</p><p>Car tourists will find Vermont\'s winding back roads, punctuated by quaint little towns dominated by white church steeples, a real pleasure.  VT Route 100, like the Long Trail and the Catamount Trail, runs the entire length of the Green Mountains, near their crest, and connects most major ski areas as well as providing a scenic drive.  The fall foliage in the northeastern United States is possibly the most spectacular in the world (along with that of Hokkaido, Manchuria, and southeastern Siberia in Asia) and the extensive, rounded, forested, and largely rural hills and mountains of Vermont are the ideal place to take in this spectacle.</p><table width=\"95%\" align=\"center\"> <br><br><br><br> <br><br><br><br><br>     <br><br></table>','Northern U.S. Appalachians','yes',NULL),(598,'1614','http://peakbagger.com/range.aspx?rid=1614','Taconic Range',4,'Mountain range with well-recognized name',42.3167,-73.3333,211,68,'<br><p>The Taconic Range is the low range of pleasantly wooded hills that runs along the western border of the New England States, separating them from the Hudson Valley of New York.

This elite group of ranges includes the well-known Colorado Rockies, the Sierra Nevada, and Mounts Rainier and Shasta in the Cascades.  And, also, the obscure White Mountains in the Great Basin.  Many people, even in California, think of New Hampshire\'s White Mountains when the name is mentioned, unaware of the giants hiding behind the Sierra in the desert north of Death Valley.</p><p>These are some of the driest mountains for their height in the world.  The towering wall of the Sierra Nevada just to the west blocks clouds and moisture, making the Whites the only 14,000 foot range in the U.S. in a rain shadow.  Although in winter snow does collect on the crest, and can last well into summer, in general the White Mountains are usually not that white.</p><p>These dry desert mountains support the sparsest of forests, but the White Mountains\' one true claim to fame rests in the gnarled old Bristlecone Pines found at elevations of 9000 to 11000 feet.  These trees are considered to be the oldest living things in the world: 5000 annual growth rings were counted in one core sample from an unidentified tree in the groves on the southern slopes of the White Mountains.  Even though Bristlecone Pines grow in many other Great Basin ranges, in the Whites they reach their greatest age.</p><p>Topographically, the White Mountains are not that steep, but they present simply appalling vertical rises from the surrounding valleys.  Both on the east, from the parched alkalai flats of Nevada\'s Fish Lake Valley, and on the west, from California\'s Chalfant and Owens Valleys, it\'s a devastating 9000 feet from the the flatlands to the top of White Mountain Peak. (The Owens Valley, incidentally, is one of only two in the United States with \"14ers\" on either side: The Sierra on the west, and the Whites on the east.  The other is the Arkansas Valley in Colorado.)  Despite this enormous relief, the Whites are quite gentle mountains, with a dirt road running up to its crest to a research station at 12,470 feet near <a href=\"peak.aspx?pid=3629\">Mount Barcroft</a>.  As a rough jeep trail, this road even continues all the way to the very top of White Mountain Peak.</p><p>The White Mountains begin in Nevada at Montgomery Pass on U.S. 6, and head south over low Mustang Mountain (10,320\') before rising to <href=\"peak.aspx?pid=3625\">Boundary Peak (13,143\'), the highest point in all Nevada.  <a href=\"peak.aspx?pid=3572\">Wheeler Peak</a> (13,063\'), the dominant summit of the central Great Basin, on the other side of the state, probably deserves this honor, but loses out to Boundary by a mere 77 feet.  To add insult to injury, the White Mountain crest enters California immediatly south of Boundary Peak and then rises higher to <a href=\"peak.aspx?pid=3626\">Mount Montgomery</a> (13,441\'), a much more rugged and impressive summit, leaving Nevada with a high point that isn\'t even dominant in its immediate vicinity.</href=\"peak.aspx?pid=3625\"></p><p>Although the crest of the White Mountains heading south is often gently rounded, it is quite rugged class 3, even class 4 in a few spots from Boundary Peak, over Montgomery and down to the 12,000\' pass between Montgomery and <a href=\"peak.aspx?pid=21529\">the Jumpoff</a> (13,480\').  From this pass up to the Jumpoff it\'s class 2 boulder-hopping.  The bounders end at about the summit of the Jumpoff, where the crest widens out and the substrate changes to gravel.  Next in line is the second highest peak in the range, <a href=\"peak.aspx?pid=3627\">Mount Dubois</a> (13,559\'), and then the crest descends to an expansive high area called Peeliser Flats, at about 12,500 feet. Heading south, there is an 11,000\' saddle between Mt. Hogue and Headley Peak.  This saddle is watered by Cabin Creek, flowing east into Fish Lake Valley, and by Birch Creek flowing west toward the Owens Valley, making it a logical overnight stop or base camp for exploration along the crest.</p><p>South from this saddle, the crest continues gentle class 1 until a short but rugged arete between peak 13,980 and White Mountain Peak.  This stretch has a succession of towers with at least one class 4 pitch. Traversing scree slopes below the crest may offer a class 2-3 alternative. Just beyond this arete there is a switchback on the jeep road, and from that point on it\'s all class 1 to <a href=\"peak.aspx?pid=3628\">White Mountain Peak</a> (14,246\'), third highest mountain in all California and 19th in the 48 states.  A little hut marks this rounded summit, over 9000 vertical feet up from the valley floor less than 7 miles away to the west.  The views, especially of the nearby Sierra Nevada, are predictably awesome from this desolate, dry, and windy summit.</p><p>Also worth mentioning are a series of canyons leading up into cirques on the eastern (Fish Lake Valley) side.  Many of these canyons are entered by moderate jeep roads, and the upper cirques are mostly (class 2) hikeable to the crest.  From these ad-hoc trailheads, elevation gains to the crest are about half of those from the Owens Valley to the crest and not unremittingly steep.</p><p>The White Mountains south from White Mountain Peak are no longer much of a wilderness, since a road closely follows the crest south from the Peak all the way to the end of the range, at Westgard Pass on CA 168.  The first few miles of road are extrememly rough, though, and now closed to vehicles.  Near the gentle summit of <a href=\"peak.aspx?pid=3629\">Mount Barcroft</a> (13,040\'), the first summit south from White Mountain Peak, the road becomes passable as it passes the Barcorft High-Altitude Research Laboratory of the University of California.  Although still only open to vehicles on laboratory business, this is the highest road in California, at 12,470 feet.</p><table width=\"95%\" align=\"center\"><br><br><br><br> <br><br><br><br>

However, the western slopes, falling away into Idaho, are much more gentle once below the immediate summit towers.  Either way, the Tetons make one of the classic picture-postcard views.<br><br><p>The Teton Range is mostly within Grand Teton National Park, just south of Yellowstone.  Tourists throng the Jackson Hole valley to gawk at the peaks and watch the large elk herds roaming the grasslands near the Snake River.  In winter, the Jackson Hole ski resort, on Rendevous Mountain a ways south of the Grand, attracts skiers who want to challenge the 4,100 feet of steep slopes.  Ski bums and powder hounds head over to the Idaho side of the range to ski at Grand Targhee, which often gets more snow than any other North American ski area.<br><br><p>Still, climbing is the quintessential Teton sport, and hanging out at the rustic Climber\'s Ranch campground in the shadow of the Grand for a summer is a rite of passage for many American rock climbers.

Presidential Range, stretching from US 2 north to the Candadian border, lies an enormous, wild, and little-known area of the White Mountains.  The peaks are low by White Mountain standards (only 2 break 4,000 feet), most of the land is owned by paper companies, there is no above-timberline terrain, and trails become more and more scarce as Canada gets closer.  In many ways this country is more akin to the huge wilderness tracts of Maine rather than the other, more heavily-visited ranges of the White Mountains. <br><br><p>The North Country begins in far northern New Hampshire near the sources of the Connecticut River, hard up against the border with Quebec.  The low mountains and hills here are really part of the <a href=\"reange.aspx?rid=16110\">Boundary Mountains</a>, which get higher to the northeast, in Maine.<br><br><p>The most prominent landmarks in the northern reaches of the White Mountains are: the Percy Peaks (3430\'), prominent twin cones overlooking Groveton; rugged Dixville Notch and its famous old resort hotel; <a href=\"peak.aspx?pid=6783\">Blue Mountain</a> (3780\'), the highest point in this wilderness; and the source of the Connecticut River along the New Hampshire-Quebec border, near Maine\'s Boundary Mountains.  Outdoor activities here are limited by lack of trails, private land, and general remoteness, but bushwhackers and explorers looking to loose the crowds may enjoy these almost forgotten northern reaches of the White Mountains.<br><br><p>South of NH Route 110 the North Country becomes higher, and a large but separate tract of the White Mountain National Forest covers most of the Pilot and Pliny Ranges, which together form a high, forested, and remote letter \"L\".  <a href=\"peak.aspx?pid=6877\">Mount Cabot</a> (4180\') in the Pilot Range and <a href=\"peak.aspx?pid=6882\">Mount Waumbek</a> (4005\') in the Pliny range are the only 4000 footers, and both are completeley forested, have a reputation as some of the dullest 4000 footers in the state, and feature trails mainly because of their height.

They will tell you about the constant steep ups and downs, the rough footing, and, most of all, about Mahoosuc Notch, \"the most difficult mile of the A.T.\", where it can take two hours to cross a half a mile of jumbled boulders.  However, this ruggedness, coupled with the range\'s relative remoteness and lack of visitors, make it an appealing destination for those who enjoy being off the beaten path a little bit.  The 30 mile backpack along the Mahoosuc Range Trail is especially rewarding, and even the strenuous dayhikes up from the unpaved Lake Success Road have their charms. <br><br><p>The northern sentinel of the Mahoosucs is Old Speck, the third highest peak in Maine, towering over scenic and utterly undeveloped Grafton Notch.<br><br><p>In contrast to the rugged wilderness of the main crest of the Mahoosucs is the humongous Sunday River ski area in the southeast foothills of the range, which recently became Maine\'s answer to Vermont\'s mammoth Killington resort. <table width=\"95%\" align=\"center\"></table>','White Mountains','yes',NULL),(1571,'16122','http://peakbagger.com/range.aspx?rid=16122','Western White Mountains',5,'Geographically-defined sub-range',44.1333,-71.8167,50,28,'','White Mountains','yes',NULL),(1572,'16123','http://peakbagger.com/range.aspx?rid=16123','Franconia Area',5,'Mountain range with well-recognized name',44.1333,-71.4,20,29,'<br><p>This area of the White Mountains is nowhere as near as famous as the Presidential Range, but can still hold its own against its famous neighbor in many ways.

There are numerous ranges within this huge tract, which can only be considered one logical unit because these roads serve as its boundaries.  The two highest and most prominent ranges are the Franconia Range and the Twin Range, but the Willey Range and the unnamed group of peaks around Mount Carrigain are also very prominent by White Mountain standards.<br><br><p>The Appalachian Trail runs across many of the major high peaks of the Franconia and Twin Ranges, but misses the Bonds and the Wiley Range.  Like in the Presidentials, though, there is a well-developed trail network, with the A.T. latching on to various pre-existing trails: the Franconia Ridge Trail, the Garfield Ridge Trail, the Twinway, and the Ethan Pond Trail.

In many ways, the four main summits of the Northern Peaks have much more to offer than Mount Washington <br>itself, since they cover more area, have more above timberline terrain, have no road or railway penetrating the area, and are far less crowded.  These magnificent peaks--Mounts Madison, Adams, and Jefferson--rise along a single massive ridge and are the 5th, 2nd, and 3rd highest in the northeast U.S., and together make up a huge, unbroken area of above timberline ridges, ravines, and summits.  Mount Clay, really just a northern sub-peak of Mount Washington, is the southernmost Northern Peak, just before the ridge merges with the bulk of Washington.  The Gulfisde trail runs along this entire range--in my opinion, the nicest hike in the eastern United States.<br><br><p>Mount Washington (6288\') is the central summit of the Presidental Range and the highest summit in the northeast U.S., rising over 800 miles from the nearest higher land, in North Carolina.  Its summit is almost a small city, with a museum, cafeteria, weather station, train depot, and parking lots crowding the windy and cold summit rocks.<br><br><p>Northeast from Mount Washington the massive, broad Chandler Ridge provides the ascent route for the summit auto road.  Between this ridge and the Northern Peaks is the vast chasm of the Great Gulf, the largest glacial cirque in the Appalachians.  A vast, deep valley, it has been a federally-protected wilderness area since 1964.<br><br><p>The Southern Peaks stretch southwest from Mount Washington and are not as high or massive as the Northern Peaks.  The Crawford Path, the oldest continuously used footpath in the country, traverses the range from Mount Clinton northwards to Mount Washington, an 8.5 mile trip.<br><br><p>At the base of Mount Washington is Bigelow Lawn, the largest of the level grassy areas of the Presidentials, and just south of that is twin-summited Mount Monroe (5385\'), an easy scamper from Lakes of the Clouds Hut at its base.  South from Monroe lie Mount Franklin (5001\'), a very indistinct bump on the ridge; Mount Eisenhower (4714\'), formerly Mount Pleasant, a dome-shaped peak still well above timberline; and Mount Pierce (4312\'), still often called by its old name, Mount Clinton.  The former name honors the obscure Franklin Pierce, the only president from New Hampshire, while the latter name does not honor the recent U.S. president, but DeWitt Clinton, governor of New York in the 1800s.<br><br><p>The Crawford Path leaves the main crest of the Southern Peaks at Mount Pierce to descend to Crawford Notch, while the A.T. continues on the main ridge, now below the trees, on the Webster Cliff Trail.  After passing Mizpah Spring Hut (3800\'), the newest (1964) of the AMC Huts, it crosses Mount Jackson (4052\'), a rocky cone that was not named after Andrew Jackson, but New England scientist Charles Jackson, a geologist and one of the inventors of anethesia.  Mount Webster (3910\'), really just a spur of Mount Jackson, is the the abrupt end of the Southern Peaks, featuring a huge wall of cliffs that forms the massive west wall fo Crawford Notch.  The Webster Cliff Trail follws the top of the escarpament south to the floor of the notch, offering a fantastic series of views.<br><br><p>While the Southern Peaks run southwest from Mount Washington, another long crest, the Montalban Ridge, runs southeast from the high, grassy tundra of Bigelow Lawn.  Beginning with Boott Spur (5500\'), a minor bump overlooking Tuckerman Ravine, the Montalban Ridge rapidly drops to below timberline and goes over many wooded summits: Mount Isolation-4005, Mount Davis (3820\'), and other lower summits.  The 13 mile Davis Path is the main trail, following most of the Montalbans all the way to Mount Washington.

Theoretically the Green Mountains of Vermont and even the Chic-Choc Mountains of Quebec are the same topographic feature, but here, just south of the wide Susquehanna River, mountainous terrain rises apruptly from lowlands after a long hiatus, and it continues all the way to Georgia.<br><br><p>This first, northernmost extention of Blue Ridge is South Mountain and its associated ridges, a large, very irregular mass covering big chunks of south-central Pennsylvania and central Maryland.  Although quite low and <br>hardly worthy of the term \"mountain\", for the Mid-Atlantic area South Mountain is quite impressive, and located very close to cities such as Washington, DC and Harrisburg, PA.  As a mountainous island in a sea of productive farming country, the views of the patchwork quilt of fields are nice, on those rare occasions when the trees clear out.<br><br><p>The Pennsylvania section of this mass, which includes extentions such as Piney Mountain (1890\') to the southeast and the Carlisle Prong to the north towards Dillsburg, is largely protected by Michaux State Forest and almost entirely traversed by the Appalachian Trail.  The highest point is boring Big Flat Pine Ridge (2100\'), which the A.T. grazes, but the high point in the section south of U.S. 30, Snowy Mountain (2080\'), has a fire tower providing fine views.<br><br><p>Other areas of South Mountain of special interest are the White Rocks-(1050\') in the Carlisle Prong, craggy Pole Steeple (1300\') on Piney Mountain, and the Chimney Rocks (1946\') just south of Snowy Mountain.  All are on or near the A.T., make nice, short half-day hikes, have cliffs big enough to attract rock-climbers, and provide a Pennsylvania rarity, nice views.<br><br><p>In Maryland, South Mountain is the western edge of the mountainous area, while a prominent and increasingly distinct ridge parallelling South Mountain to the east is Catoctin Mountain (1917\').  The Appalachian Trail runs along the crest of South Mountain as it gets narrower and narrower as it approaches the Potomac, missing Mt. Quirauk (2140\'), just south of the Mason-Dixon line separating Pennsylvania and Maryland, due to the presence of the Fort Ritchie Military Reservation.<br><br><p>Catoctin Mountain, which starts out as a wide plateau connected to South Mountain on the west, becomes a low and narrow ridge west of Frederick, MD before petering out into nothingness into Virginia.  In the pleasant forests of Catoctin Mountain west of Thurmont, MD is one of the few U.S. governemnt-owned areas in the mountains where visitors are not encouraged--Camp David, the rural retreat for U.S. Presidents.<br><br><p>As South Mountain and the Appalachian Trail approach the Potomac River, a parallel ridge appears to the west--the genesis of the actual Blue Ridge.  At the Potomac near Harpers Ferry, VA, where the river has carved a double water gap that has been impressing tourists since George Washington, the A.T. drops down off of South Mountain, follows the towpath of the old Chesapeake and Ohio Canal west to the historic town of Harpers Ferry, then climbs steeply up to the Blue Ridge, which it then follows for over 200 miles (see <a href=\"range.aspx?rid=16401\">the Far North Blue Ridge</a>).  Across the Potomac South Mountain becomes Short Hill Mountain, which soon disapppears.<table width=\"95%\" align=\"center\"></table>','Northern Blue Ridge','yes',NULL),(1634,'16401','http://peakbagger.com/range.aspx?rid=16401','Northern Virginia Blue Ridge',5,'Geographically-defined sub-range',38.9333,-77.65,95,66,'<br><p>The Blue Ridge from the Potomac River at scenic and historic Harpers <br>Ferry, WV south to Chester Gap near Front Royal, VA is a single, sharp, ridge, still relatively low but slightly higher than the Blue Ridge or South Mountain north of the Potomac.  It starts out by rising to about 1100 feet directly up out of the Potomac, curiously lower than parallel Short Hill Mountain (1484\') just to the east.  Short Hill Mountain soon dies down into insignificance, though, while the Blue Ridge continues south, gaining height gradually and letting no streams across its crest, despite several wind gaps where highways such as I-66 cross.  South of Ashby Gap the Blue Ridge reaches 2000 feet, and south of Manassas Gap (950\') (where I-66 crosses) <a href=\"peak.aspx?pid=7648\">High Knob</a> (2388\') is the highest point on the whole Blue Ridge north of Shenandoah National Park.  The Appalachian Trail follows the backbone of this ridge at first, but for a long stretch where the ridge is known as Mount Weather it sadly contours along the low western slopes. <br><br><p>For its first 15 miles, this low and (let\'s face it) somewhat <br>uninteresting 40-mile crest marks the Virginia-West Virginia border.  Despite John Denver\'s song \"County Roads\", in which he sings \"Almost Heaven/West Virginia/Blue Ridge Mountains/Shenandoah River\", this insignificant chunk of the massive Blue Ridge is all West Virginia can claim.  The Shenandoah River and its namesake valley, paralelling the ridge to the west, is also in West Virginia for only 15 miles.  Strangely, though, the Appalachian Trail Conference is headquartered in Harpers Ferry, WV.  This means that the umbrella organization for all hiking clubs that maintain the 2,000 mile long Appalachian Trail is in the state with by far the least amount of A.T. mileage, 15 measly miles that are shared with neighboring Virginia.<table width=\"95%\" align=\"center\"></table>','Northern Blue Ridge','yes',NULL),(1635,'16402','http://peakbagger.com/range.aspx?rid=16402','Shenandoah-North Section',5,'Geographically-defined sub-range',38.6667,-78.0667,43,49,'<br><p>Shenandoah National Park is a long, narrow strip that covers a 100 mile <br>stretch of the Blue Ridge in northern Virginia, from Chester Gap (1300\') near Front Royal south to Rockfish Gap (1900\') near Waynesboro.  Here the Blue Ridge finally gets serious, rising above 4000 feet and becoming a complex mountain range.  To the northeast, the nearest 4000 foot peaks are in New York State\'s Catskills, making the park a popular destination for those in the Mid-Atlantic seeking the high country.  Although high, the Blue Ridge here is way too far south to reach timberline--instead, the charms of the place are in its wilderness forests, several craggy summits, abundant wildlife, excellent trail networks, and a great mountain road. <br><br><p>Shenandoah has a twin backbone: the Skyline Drive for cars, and the <br>Appalacian Trail for hikers.  These two routes are never far apart as they <br>cross each other 30 times, both traversing the entire length of the park from north to south.  They are also both pure pleasures: the Skyline Drive is a gently winding, well-paved, very scenic route with many turouts and no trucks allowed, while Shenandoah\'s Appalachain Trail is a wide, easy, gentle path with a reputation as the best-maintained section of the Trail\'s 2000 mile length.  The only drawback is that both can also get very crowded--the Skyline Drive can get clogged with slow Winnebagos, while typical National Park camping rules and regulations are necessary to control the throngs of <br>backpackers in much of the park. <br><br><p>Two roads cross the park from east to west, U.S. 211 at Thornton Gap (2300\') and U.S. 33 at Swift Run Gap (2400\').  These two roads divide the park into three sections of (very) roughly equal size, a northern, central, and southern.  Some broad generalizations: the northern section is the smallest, is heavily visited due to closeness to Washington, DC, and has some fine terrain.  The central section is by far the highest, most rugged, and most visited, containing both the park\'s 4000 foot peaks as well as its most spectacular, <a href=\"peak.aspx?pid=7662\">Old Rag Mountian</a> (3268\').  The southern section is by far the least visited, on average the lowest, and a good place to loose the crowds on nice summer weekends.<br><br><p>The Northern Section: The main Blue Ridge crest and the Appalachian Trail <br>enter the park up a ways from Chester Gap, but the Skyline Drive begins at the big tourist town of Front Royal, VA, and snakes south along Dickey Ridge for a while before joining the main divide and the A.T.  This first section of the Drive is especially scenic, offering almost aerial views of Front Royal and the pleasant surrounding farms.  Further south the Blue Ridge reaches 3000 feet for the first time at <a href=\"peak.aspx?pid=7650\">North Marshall Mountain</a> (3368\'), and the first significant outlier, <a href=\"peak.aspx?pid=7652\">The Peak</a> (2925\'), is found jutting off ito the Piedmont to the east.  <br><br>The highest point in the northern section of Shenandoah National Park is <br><a href=\"peak.aspx?pid=7651\">Hogback Mountain</a> (3474\'), near Mathews Arm Campground, the main visitor facility in the section.  The highest waterfall in the park, Big Falls on Overall Run, is downhill to the west from this area.<br><br><p>The Central Section: The Blue Ridge gets even higher south of Thornton <br>Gap, rising to the <a href=\"peak.aspx?pid=7656\">Pinnacle</a> (3730\'), fourth highest peak in the park, and then to <a href=\"peak.aspx?pid=7657\">Stony Man</a> (4010\') and <a href=\"peak.aspx?pid=7661\">Hawksbill</a> (4050\'), the first 4000 footers on the Blue Ridge and the only ones for the next 70 miles to the south.  For some reason the Appalachain Trail skirts these peaks to the west, but each summit is easily reached form the Skyline Drive by short trails.  The Drive\'s high point is 3680 feet, east of Stony Man, so the vertical gain is not particularly awe-inspiring on these hikes.  Both summits provide nice views.  The two main visitor center/museum/campground complexes here are at Skylands, an old resort are that pre-dates the 1930s-era park establishment, and Big Meadows, an open, grassy saddle on the ridge some miles south of Hawksbill. <br><br><p>The most spectacular peak in the park, and perhaps all Virginia, is <a href=\"peak.aspx?pid=7662\">Old Rag</a> (3268\'), a large, solitary mountain well east of Stony Man, Hawksbill and the main Blue Ridge.  Don\'t be fooled by its embarassingly low elevation--Old Rag boasts awesome and wild summit ledges, outstanding views of the Blue Ridge and the farms of the Piedmont, and a trail running along its sheer northwest cliffs that is among the most demanding and difficult in the country, with tricky passages through narrow defiles and boulder caves.  The trailheads for Old Rag, in the deep hollows at the mountian\'s base, are less than two hours from Washington, DC, making the extraordinary loop hike over the peak very popular.  This area is connected to the Skyline Drive and A.T. in the Skylands area by Whiteoak Canyon, a wooded ravine featuring many beautiful waterfalls that only adds to the overall splendor of this very attractive region.<br><br><p>South from Hawksbill the Blue Ridge gets slightly lower, passing over <br><a href=\"peak.aspx?pid=7665\">Hazeltop</a> (3812\'), the highest point on the actual Appalachian trail in the park, then <a href=\"peak.aspx?pid=7668\">Bush Mountain</a> (3527\') before carrying the very closely parallel Skyline Drive and A.T. to Swift Run Gap at U.S. 33.<br><br><p>The Southern Section: With no especially high or spectacular mountians, <br>and far from big cities, the southern section of Shenandoah National Park is <br>in some sense the backwater of the park.  The highest point is <a href=\"peak.aspx?pid=7671\">Hightop</a> (3587\'), just south of Swift Run Gap, and <a href=\"peak.aspx?pid=7673\">Loft Mountain</a> (3300\'), Flattop (3320\') and Cedar Mountain (3330\'), all near the Loft Mountain campground, are all relatively high.  However, the Skyline Drive doesn\'t ever get aboe 3000 feet here, and the Appalachian Trail slavishly follows this road, often only a few hundred yards away for much of this section.  Perhaps the main attraction of the southern section is the large wilderness area to the west of the main crest, with many trails serving <a href=\"peak.aspx?pid=7672\">Rocky Mount</a> (2741\'), Rocky Mountain (2864\'), and Rockytop and its ridge (2856\').  This area definitely ranks high nationally in the confusing nomenclature department, too.  Don\'t go excpecting the Rockies, but it is a great place to backpack for a few days away from the much of the hordes thronging, say, Whiteoak Canyon.<br><br><p>The main part of Shenandoah National Park ends at Jarman Gap, but a <br>skinny finger of park land allows the Skyline Drive to extend south to I-64 at Rockfish Gap.

The first section of Blue Ridge traversed by the Parkway is what this site calls the Central Virginia Blue Ridge, the 115 mile stretch between Rockfish Gap and the low gap of the Roanoke River at Roanoke, VA.<br><br><p>Few people realize it, but the Blue Ridge here is higher (nine 4000 footers to Shenandoah\'s two), wilder, and much less crowded than the section in the Shenandoah National Park.  Also, the Appalachian Trail, while still paralleling the Blue Ridge Parkway, is rougher and usually well away from the road, unlike the way the well-graded A.T. closely follows the Skyline Drive.  There are no extensive side-trail networks, and no awesome Old Rag Mountain, but aside from that, this long stretch of Blue Ridge has much to offer those who don\'t need official National Park status and the accompanying visitor centers, campgrounds, and crowds to enjoy their mountains.<br><br><p>South of Rockfish Gap the Blue Ridge very quickly gets higher than any point in the whole southern section of Shenandoah National Park, at Humpback Mountain (3600\') and Devil\'s Knob (3851\'), where one of the rare visitor centers on the Blue Ridge Parkway offers a few trails.  Further south, near the small town of Montebello, VA, is the greatest concentration of high peaks in the whole Northern Blue Ridge, where the Ridge becomes a rugged highland containing seven of its eleven 4000 footers.

For example, Tobacco Row Mountain (2932\') is a significant eastern <br>outlier, well away from the main range, that provides great views of the Piedmont and the main ridge from its lookout tower, while many other foothills, spurs, and parallel wooded ridges make the Blue Ridge often over 10 miles wide.<br><br><p>This impressive range is abruptly cut by the James River near Glasgow, <br>VA, the first time the ridge is crossed by a stream south of the Potomac.  The James winds it way through a canyon with mountains rising over 2000 feet on either side, perhaps the most significant water gap in the Appalachains.  US Route 501 precariously winds through it, and the Appalachian Trail provides some views as it plunges down and then back up, but the Blue Ridge Parkway wimps out, leaving the ridge and swinging out to cross the James to the east of the heart of the gap.  The crossing is the lowest point on the whole Blue Ridge Parkway, 649 feet.<br><br><p>Just south of the James River the Northern Blue Ridge immediately rises <br>to <a href=\"peak.aspx?pid=7687\">Apple Orchard Mountain</a> (4225\'), highest point on the Blue Ridge in all Virginia, making the Parkway and A.T. awfully steep for quite a bit.  Neither, though, goes over the peak, which is the home of a radar station.  The Parkway, though, reaches 3950 feet, its Virginia high point.  Apple Orchard Falls, on the west slopes of Apple Orchard Mountain, is on a popular loop hike that uses part of the Appalachian Trail.<br><br><p><a href=\"peak.aspx?pid=7688\">The Peaks of Otter</a>, Flat Top (4004\') and Sharp Top (3852\'), are the most popular recreation area in this stretch of the Blue Ridge.  A visitor center, a road that carries shuttle buses to the summit of Sharp Top, and a good trail network are the main attractions here, all located right on the Blue Ridge Parkway, although the A.T. is far away to the west at this point.  Isolated from other high mountains, the views from these peaks are fine, especially, as one might expect, from Sharp Top.<br><br><p>The Peaks of Otter are the last gasp of the Blue Ridge before the wide, low gap at Roanoke, VA.  Not far south from that area the mountains start to peter out, the Appalachian Trail leaves the Blue Ridge to cross I-81 and the <br>(thankfully for through hikers) very narrow Valley of Virginia over into the Appalachian Ridges, and the Blue Ridge Parkway drops into the lowlands to skirt the sprawl of Roanoke to the east.

Near Potato Knob (6400\'-not Potato Hill further north) the Mount Mitchell spur road joins the Blue Ridge Parkway, which follows the crest as it suddenly turns northwest over Blackstock Knob (6320\') to Balsam Gap (5400\'), where the Black Mountains end. <br><br><p>That is a total of seven main 6000 foot peaks, sixteen including subpeaks.

not surprisingly, the highest and most important range of the vast Franconia Region.  In all the Appalachians, it ranks third behind the Presidentials and Katahdin in above timberline acerage, making its crest a popular and spectacular hike.  Mount Lafayette (5242\') is the dominant peak  at the north end of the 6-mile range, and the narrow, treeless crest then runs south over utterly minor Mount Truman (5100\'), somewhat minor Mount Lincoln (5089\'), and the open shoulder of Little Haystack (4500\').  A circut hike from U.S. 3 on the Old Bridle Path, Franconia Ridge Trail, and Falling Waters Trail, going along this crest, is one of the classics, and well worth it just for the views, even if it can get crowded. <br><br><p>South from Little Haystack the ridge becomes forested, but the fine rocky cone of Mount Liberty (4460\') rises out of the trees further south, and the impressive western cliffs of Mount Flume (4327\') mark the southern end of the impressive part of this range.  Mount Osseo (or Whaleback, 3586\') and the Coolidge Mountains (Big at 3294\' and Little at 2421\') lie to the south, trailless since the Osseo trail was re-routed several years ago.<br><br><p>The northeast extention of the Franconia Range, extending from Mount Lafayette\'s high north ridge, is the rugged Garfield Ridge.  The Garfield Ridge trail, part of the Appalachian Trail, is known as one of the rougher footpaths in the White Mountains, climbing over many forested knolls with rough footing.  Mount Garfield (4458\'), a rocky cone much like Mount Liberty, is the ridge\'s high point.<br><br><p>Another spur of the Franconia Range is the forested crest of Owls Head (4023\'), cradled in the horseshoe formed by the Franconia, Garfield, and Twin Ranges and lying in the heart of the Pemigewasset Wilderness.  Infamous as the only 4000 footer in New England without an official trail to its summit, and one of the most remote from a trailhead, it is usually ascended by means of a steep, miserable landslide path on its west flank.  Many a peakbagger has cursed his way up the crumbling rock and dirt of the slide and the steep herd path to the top to find no views for his exertions.<br><br><table width=\"95%\" align=\"center\"></table>','Franconia Area','yes',NULL),(2860,'161231','http://peakbagger.com/range.aspx?rid=161231','Twin Range',6,'Mountain range with well-recognized name',44.1833,-71.55,12,8,'<br><p>The Twin Range is a huge, sprawling, remote mass of mountains that is probably the most uncrowded yet high and scenic sub-range in all the White Mountains.  Even though it ranks third in height in the Whites, the Twin Range is far from any highways, discouraging dayhikers in favor of backpackers from the Pemigewasset Wilderness and users of the A.M.C.\'s Galehead Hut, least visited in their eight-hut chain.<br><br><p>The range begins with North Twin (4714\'), an undistinguished, forested peak, and then runs south to South Twin (4902\'), the highest in the Twin Range, its summit just barely above the trees and offering excellent views.  Next is Mount Guyot (4560\'), which although considered just a sub-peak of South Twin, is actually more interesting due to its large above-timberline area covering its flat summit.  South from Guyot lie the real gems of the Twin Range, the Bonds.  Mount Bond (4698\'), West Bond (4520\'), and the Bondcliffs (4265\') cradle remote and alluring Hellgate Ravine, and are the three most remote White Mountain 4000-footers from a road.  The Bondcliffs, a long, open, craggy crest, are especailly awsome.  The Bondcliff trail and its spurs connect all three summits to the Twinway (Appalachian trail) at Mount Guyot, but Hellgate Ravine remains one of the great bushwahcks in the Whites. <br><br><p>Three more 4000 footers are spurs from the Twin Range: Mount Galehead, a minor summit connecting with the Garfield Ridge that eventually leads to the Franconia Range; Mount Zealand, a forested knoll to the east; and, north from Mount Zealand, fine, open Mount Hale (4077\'), major summit of the ridge called the Little River Mountains.  A spur of Zealand Mountain to the east forms one wall of Zealand Notch, site of Zealand Falls A.M.C. hut beside especially scenic waterfalls.  Zealand Pond in Zealand Notch has two outlets, one flowing to the Connecticut River, the other to the <br>Merrimac, making a large chunk of New England an island of sorts--this is one of the few examples of this hydrologic phenomenon in the United States.<table width=\"95%\" align=\"center\"></table>','Franconia Area','yes',NULL),(2861,'161232','http://peakbagger.com/range.aspx?rid=161232','Willey Range',6,'Mountain range with well-recognized name',44.2,-71.4333,9,7,'<br><p>After the Franconia and Twin Ranges, the third great north-south running range in the Franconia Region is the Willey Range, forming the region\'s eastern boundary.  Mount Tom (4051\'), Mount Field (4320\', named after Darby Field, first climber of Mount Washington in 1642), and Mount Willey (4255\') are the principal summits, but perhaps more interesting are two lower spurs to the east that help form the western wall of long, deep Crawford Notch.  Mount Avalon (3440\') and especially Mount Willard (2865\') provide incredible views down the Notch, its parallel green walls running far away off to the <br>south forming one of the best views in the White Mountains.</p><p>To the west, off towards the Twin Range, trailless Whitewall Mountain (3405\') and its (not surprisingly) white slide-scarred walls provide one side of deep and scenic Zealand Notch.</p><table width=\"95%\" align=\"center\"><br><br></table>','Franconia Area','yes',NULL),(2862,'161233','http://peakbagger.com/range.aspx?rid=161233','Pemigewasset Ranges',6,'Mountain range with well-recognized name',44.1,-71.4667,11,12,'<br><p>The huge, wooded expanse to the south of the Franconia, Twin, and Wiley Ranges is the Pemigewasset Wilderness, or, affectionately, \"The Pemi\".  The entire area was part of a massive logging operation in the early part of the 1900s, but the regions\'s recovery from clear-cutting is now complete, and many of the backpackers who explore this vast woodland wouldn\'t even realize its history if most of the hiking trails of the Pemi weren\'t on old logging railroad beds, many with ties and spikes still visible. <br><br><p>The southern end of the Twin Range penetrates into the heart of the Pemi, making Mount Bond (4689\') the area\'s high point, but there are also many other peaks littering the area.  Owl\'s Head-4023, a spur of the Francoania Range, is the other major summit in the northern part of this area.<br><br><p>A wild and rugged range without a name forms the southern part of the Pemigewasset Wilderness.  Mount Carrigain-4680, an outstanding high peak with very wide-ranging views from its summit ovservation tower, is the principal summit.  Mount Hancock-4410 and South Hancock-4200 are the only other summits with trails, leaving the many high 3000 footers just east of Carrigain (Lowell at 3743\', Nancy at 3926\', Anderson at 3722\', and Bemis at 3725\') as well as the large mass of Mount Huntington (3700\') to the south of Hancock utterly trailless, wild, and rarely visited.<br><br><p>The main artery of the Pemi is the Wilderness Trail, following the East Branch of the Pemigewasset from the Kancamangus Highway almost to Mount Carrigain.  This trail and those feeding off of it are the center of excellent backpacking country, owing to the enormous size of the area, many fine peaks ringing it, the relative flatness of much of the central terrain, and the lack of dayhikers and A.M.C. hut users.  Anyone backpacking here on a crowded summer weekend, though, is apt to wonder if the Pemi really is a Wilderness.<br><br><p>The southern edge of the Franconia Region is the Kancamangus Highway (NH 112), a 34-mile road leading from North Woodstock to Conway.  Only in the central area near its 2830-foot summit at Kancamangus Pass does the road offer much in really nice mountain views, since it runs through thick forest for the most part, but it is still a very pleasant, uncommercialized drive, particularly nice in fall foliage season.  The many campgrounds along its length are very popular, and many trailheads lead to the Waterville-Sandwich area and the Pemi, including the massive Wilderness Trail parking lot.<table width=\"95%\" align=\"center\"></table>','Franconia Area','yes',NULL),(2863,'161234','http://peakbagger.com/range.aspx?rid=161234','Moat-Bear Notch Area',6,'Bogus mountain grouping for this site',44.05,-71.2667,8,16,'','Franconia Area','yes',NULL),(2864,'161240','http://peakbagger.com/range.aspx?rid=161240','Cherry-Dartmouth Range',6,'Mountain range with well-recognized name',44.3667,-71.4833,15,13,'','Presidential Range','yes',NULL),(2865,'161241','http://peakbagger.com/range.aspx?rid=161241','Northern Peaks',6,'Mountain range with well-recognized name',44.3333,-71.2833,8,11,'','Presidential Range','yes',NULL),(2866,'161242','http://peakbagger.com/range.aspx?rid=161242','Mount Washington Massif',6,'Area dominanted by a single large peak',44.2667,-71.3,5,8,'','Presidential Range','yes',NULL),(2867,'161243','http://peakbagger.com/range.aspx?rid=161243','Southern Peaks',6,'Mountain range with well-recognized name',44.2167,-71.3833,8,7,'','Presidential Range','yes',NULL),(2868,'161244','http://peakbagger.com/range.aspx?rid=161244','Montalban-Rocky Branch Ridges',6,'Bogus mountain grouping for this site',44.15,-71.2667,12,9,'','Presidential Range','yes',NULL),(2869,'161250','http://peakbagger.com/range.aspx?rid=161250','Carter Range',6,'Mountain range with well-recognized name',44.25,-71.1833,22,14,'<br><p>The Carter Range is located east of the Presidential Range, running northeast from Pinkham Notch into Maine.
