(1,'Yosemite Decimal System','YDS','YDS','United States','United States','In a nutshell, the YDS \"categorizes terrain according to the techniques and physical difficulties encountered when rock climbing.\"  The system originally considered only the technical difficulty of the hardest move on a route. For example, a route of mainly 5.7 moves but with one 5.11b move would be graded 5.11b and a climb that consisted of 5.11b moves all along its route would also be 5.11b. Modern application of climbing grades, especially on climbs at the upper end of the scale (>5.10), also consider how sustained or strenuous a climb is, in addition to the difficulty of the single hardest move. \"/\" is typically used in the letter designations to further differentiate difficulties. A \"+\" in the lower grades usually indicates the grade is sandbagged, especially for 5.9+. At 5.10 and higher, sometimes a more generic system is used where \"-\" indicates easy, \"+\" indicates hard, and lack of any letter or \"+/-\" means solid for the number grade. In places like Indian Creek you will typically see the grades as a 5.10 + or - or just the straight number because it depends quite a bit on your hand size. The cracks are so splitter that if one move is hard they all are going to be hard for you.'),
(2,'National Climbing Classification System ','NCSS','NCSS','United States','United States','The NCCS describes the overall nature of a climb in terms of time and technical difficulty taking the following into account: length of climb, number of hard pitches, difficulty of hardest pitch, average difficulty, commitment, route finding problems, and overall ascent time. It is often call the \"commitment grade.\" It is notable that the approach and remoteness of a climb might not affect the grade. This is especially relevant to the North Cascades which are known for their challenging and rigorous approaches so much so that local guidebook authors have devised their own approach ratings. An optional + or ? may be used to further differentiate difficulty. '),
(3,'International French Adjectival System','Alpine Grade','IFAS','International','French','The overall difficulty of a route, taking into consideration the length, difficulty, exposure and commitment-level of the route (i.e., how hard it may be to retreat). The overall grade combines altitude; length and difficulty of approach and descent; number of difficult pitches and how sustained they are; exposure; and quality of rock, snow and ice. This system originated with UIAA Roman numerals; it is now generally seen with French letters and is increasingly being used worldwide. Often a + (pronounced Sup for sup곩eur) or a ? (pronounced Inf for inf곩eur) is placed after the grade to indicate if a particular climb is at the lower or upper end of that grade (e.g., a climb slightly harder than \"PD+\" might be \"AD?\").'),
(4,'Alaskan Grade System','Alaskan Grade','AK','Alaska','Alaskan','The Alaskan Grading system is based on Boyd N. Everett, Jr.\'s 1966 paper \"The Organization of an Alaskan Expedition.\" He felt that a grading system unique to Alaska was needed because of the severe storms, extreme cold, and altitude. Realize that conditions can and will change daily, which accounts for wild swings in the subjective difficulty of a route. Remember, that 5.7 climb in the Valley might feel 5.10 if you are carrying a heavy pack, high on Denali during storm conditions. A plus (+) may be added to indicate somewhat higher difficulty. This rating system is typically limited to Alaska.'),
(5,'Union Internationale des Associations D\'Alpin','UIAA','UIAA','International','Europe','The UIAA grading system is mostly used for short rock routes in Germany, Austria, Switzerland, Czech Republic, Slovakia and Hungary. On long routes it is often used in the Alps and Himalaya. Using Roman numerals, it was originally intended to run from I (easiest) to VI (hardest), but as with all other grading systems, improvements to climbing standards have led to the system being open-ended after the grade VII was accepted in 1977. An optional + or ? may be used to further differentiate difficulty. '),
(6,'New Wave Aid Grade','Aid',NULL,'International','United States','New routes put-up by big-wall aficionados often are given a \"New Wave\" rating using the original symbols with new definitions. When the letter \"C\" replaces \"A\", the rating refers to \"clean\" climbingة.e., without a hammer. \"+\" indicates a tricky or strenuous section; found on either strenuous terrain (roof or deep corner) or an unusually tricky \"boulder problem\" aid move (expanding flake, huge reach). Pitches marked with a \"+\" are thought provoking and often more time consuming. \"F\" comes after a \"C\" rating and denotes a pitch that relies on fixed gear in order to go hammerless. Ninety-five percent of the time pitches marked with \"F\" go hammerless, but to be safe put a hammer and a couple of copperheads and pins in the bottom of the haulbag in case fixed gear is missing. Don\'t remove fixed heads on a trade route unless it is a timebomb that you are replacing. The process of placing and removing copperheads eventually destroys the crack. A carefully cleaned piton usually leads to a clean aid placement.'),
