There is an approach called "working backwards" that is widely used at Amazon. They work backwards from the customer, rather than starting with an idea for a product and trying to bolt customers onto it. While working backwards can be applied to any specific product decision, using this approach is especially important when developing new products or features.

For new initiatives a product manager typically starts by writing an internal press release announcing the finished product. The target audience for the press release is the new/updated product's customers, which can be retail customers or internal users of a tool or technology. Internal press releases are centered around the customer problem, how current solutions (internal or external) fail, and how the new product will blow away existing solutions.

If the benefits listed don't sound very interesting or exciting to customers, then perhaps they're not (and shouldn't be built). Instead, the product manager should keep iterating on the press release until they've come up with benefits that actually sound like benefits. Iterating on a press release is a lot less expensive than iterating on the product itself (and quicker!).

If the press release is more than a page and a half, it is probably too long. Keep it simple. 3-4 sentences for most paragraphs. Cut out the fat. Don't make it into a spec. You can accompany the press release with a FAQ that answers all of the other business or execution questions so the press release can stay focused on what the customer gets. My rule of thumb is that if the press release is hard to write, then the product is probably going to suck. Keep working at it until the outline for each paragraph flows.

Oh, and I also like to write press-releases in what I call "Oprah-speak" for mainstream consumer products. Imagine you're sitting on Oprah's couch and have just explained the product to her, and then you listen as she explains it to her audience. That's "Oprah-speak", not "Geek-speak".

Once the project moves into development, the press release can be used as a touchstone; a guiding light. The product team can ask themselves, "Are we building what is in the press release?" If they find they're spending time building things that aren't in the press release (overbuilding), they need to ask themselves why. This keeps product development focused on achieving the customer benefits and not building extraneous stuff that takes longer to build, takes resources to maintain, and doesn't provide real customer benefit (at least not enough to warrant inclusion in the press release).

## A Personalized and Dynamic Climbing Gear Planner ##
## Helping climbers pack and rack for their next big adventure. ##

![Large rack of gigantic cams](https://github.com/MarkPThomas/hr-rpp29-mvp/blob/master/rackBanner.jpeg "When you need to rack up to sack up.")

## The App ##
  Have you ever been at Indian Creek and left some badly needed cams at the car? Or how about you lugged up an enormous pack and it turned out you could have left half of the gear behind? If not, I bet you spent a LOT of time writing down the rack needed for each climb for the day, worked out Friend and Aliens sizes translated Camalots, Totems, and DMM Dragons, and tabulated the results. You sick twisted little monkey!

  Well these pains of climbing at Indian Creek are now a thing of the past! By using Rack.ly, you can update your personal rack inventory, join up with friends, select the climbs that you want to do for the day, and let the app tell YOU what you need to bring - or what you are short on. No more guessing, and more time is left for climbing!

  Future versions of the app will let YOU tell Rack.ly what rack you used to help others out. You will also be able to save plans, and have plans span multiple days out for a road trip or backpacking trip. Visit the the [GitHub Repo](https://github.com/MarkPThomas/hr-rpp29-mvp) for more information on upcoming features, and how you can get involved!

## Your Problem ##
  What is the rack that our group needs to pack for the climbing today and what we have on our agenda?

## The Solution ##
  Easy! If you have recorded the rack you and your party has on the app, just add the routes you plan to climb and the app will tell you what you need, and most importantly, what you may be lacking.

> "With this app, you can leave the kitchen sink at home."
>    - Mark P. Thomas, app developer


## How to Get Started ##
  Just start up the app, fill out the gear out own, and select the climbs you want to do. It's that easy! You can save your rack and day itinerary to visit for another time as well. If you don't have it installed, or want more documentaiton, visit the [GitHub Repo](https://github.com/MarkPThomas/hr-rpp29-mvp).
