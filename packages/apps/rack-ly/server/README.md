## The App ##
  Have you ever been at Indian Creek and left some badly needed cams at the car? Or how about you lugged up an enormous pack and it turned out you could have left half of the gear behind? If not, I bet you spent a LOT of time writing down the rack needed for each climb for the day, worked out Friend and Aliens sizes translated Camalots, Totems, and DMM Dragons, and tabulated the results. You sick twisted little monkey!

  Well these pains of climbing at Indian Creek are now a thing of the past! By using Rack.ly, you can update your personal rack inventory, join up with friends, select the climbs that you want to do for the day, and let the app tell YOU what you need to bring - or what you are short on. No more guessing, and more time is left for climbing!

  Future versions of the app will let YOU tell Rack.ly what rack you used to help others out. You will also be able to save plans, and have plans span multiple days out for a road trip or backpacking trip. Visit the the [GitHub Repo](https://github.com/MarkPThomas/hr-rpp29-mvp) for more information on upcoming features, and how you can get involved!

## Your Problem ##
  What is the rack that our group needs to pack for the climbing today and what we have on our agenda?

## The Solution ##
  Easy! If you have recorded the rack you and your party has on the app, just add the routes you plan to climb and the app will tell you what you need, and most importantly, what you may be lacking.
