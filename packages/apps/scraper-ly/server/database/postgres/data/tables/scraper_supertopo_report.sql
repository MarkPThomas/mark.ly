Despite having great weather in late June, the Pacific Northwest was suffering from lingering winter weather in mid-July, and winter conditions persisted on many routes in the Cascades. Since I was only in town for two weeks, I was willing to put up with a mediocre forecast in order to get up on the route and hopefully catch a weather window. Though we had originally planned to do the climb Thursday-Saturday, the NOAA point forecast got us to shift the climb to Friday-Sunday so that we\'d have the best weather on Sunday. Friday morning the forecast called for a good chance of rain &amp; snow the first two days, and \"Mostly Sunny\" for Sunday and beyond. Two days of putting up with rain &amp; snow until weather cleared or we popped above the clouds seemed an all right price to pay to catch the weather window Sunday. <br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\nTo be safe, we would also carry enough food &amp; fuel for 5 days for the 3 day climb in case weather delayed us on the climb. We also brought a GPS with pre-recorded waypoints for the approach, climb, and descent. This proved valuable on the climb.<br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\n<b>Friday - The Weather Ain\'t That Bad!</b><br>\r\r\nDespite the \'bad\' forecast, it was actually pretty clear on Mt Rainier. <br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\n<div class=\"photonormal\">\r\n<table valign=\"top\" border=\"0\" width=\"626\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" class=\"sdw_box\">\r\n			<tr>\r\n			  <td><img src=\"/nav_img/top_left_sdw.gif\" width=\"13\" height=\"13\"></td>\r\n			  <td class=\"sdw_top\"></td>\r\n			  <td><img src=\"/nav_img/top_right_sdw.gif\" width=\"13\" height=\"13\"></td>\r\n			</tr>\r\n			<tr>\r\n			  <td class=\"sdw_left\"></td>\r\n			  <td class=\"sdw_body\" width=\"600\"><div>\r\n<a href=\"javascript:photoZoom(\'Mjs7OjY-ISEi\')\" title=\"Click to enlarge\"><img src=\"http://www.supertopo.com/photos/9/17/213267_16227_L.jpg\" width=\"600\" height=\"399\" name=\"\" alt=\"\"></a><span class=\"small\"><div class=\"photo-credit\">Credit: PellucidWombat</div></span>\r\n</div></td>\r\n			  <td class=\"sdw_right\"></td>\r\n			</tr>\r\n			<tr>\r\n			  <td><img src=\"/nav_img/bottom_left_sdw.gif\" width=\"13\" height=\"13\"></td>\r\n			  <td class=\"sdw_bottom\"></td>\r\n			  <td><img src=\"/nav_img/bottom_right_sdw.gif\" width=\"13\" height=\"13\"></td>\r\n			</tr>\r\n		  </table>\r\n</div>We had nice views of the lower mountain on the approach to lower Curtis Camp, and visibility was not a problem on the Winthrop Glacier.<br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\n<div class=\"photonormal\">\r\n<table valign=\"top\" border=\"0\" width=\"626\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" class=\"sdw_box\">\r\n			<tr>\r\n			  <td><img src=\"/nav_img/top_left_sdw.gif\" width=\"13\" height=\"13\"></td>\r\n			  <td class=\"sdw_top\"></td>\r\n			  <td><img src=\"/nav_img/top_right_sdw.gif\" width=\"13\" height=\"13\"></td>\r\n			</tr>\r\n			<tr>\r\n			  <td class=\"sdw_left\"></td>\r\n			  <td class=\"sdw_body\" width=\"600\"><div>\r\n<a href=\"javascript:photoZoom(\'Mjs7OjY7KCQj\')\" title=\"Click to enlarge\"><img src=\"http://www.supertopo.com/photos/9/17/213268_27539_L.jpg\" width=\"600\" height=\"364\" name=\"\" alt=\"\"></a><span class=\"small\"><div class=\"photo-credit\">Credit: PellucidWombat</div></span>\r\n</div></td>\r\n			  <td class=\"sdw_right\"></td>\r\n			</tr>\r\n			<tr>\r\n			  <td><img src=\"/nav_img/bottom_left_sdw.gif\" width=\"13\" height=\"13\"></td>\r\n			  <td class=\"sdw_bottom\"></td>\r\n			  <td><img src=\"/nav_img/bottom_right_sdw.gif\" width=\"13\" height=\"13\"></td>\r\n			</tr>\r\n		  </table>\r\n</div>Little Tahoma Pk<br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\n<div class=\"photonormal\">\r\n<table valign=\"top\" border=\"0\" width=\"626\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" class=\"sdw_box\">\r\n			<tr>\r\n			  <td><img src=\"/nav_img/top_left_sdw.gif\" width=\"13\" height=\"13\"></td>\r\n			  <td class=\"sdw_top\"></td>\r\n			  <td><img src=\"/nav_img/top_right_sdw.gif\" width=\"13\" height=\"13\"></td>\r\n			</tr>\r\n			<tr>\r\n			  <td class=\"sdw_left\"></td>\r\n			  <td class=\"sdw_body\" width=\"600\"><div>\r\n<a href=\"javascript:photoZoom(\'Mjs7OjY3JiEg\')\" title=\"Click to enlarge\"><img src=\"http://www.supertopo.com/photos/9/17/213269_26576_L.jpg\" width=\"600\" height=\"305\" name=\"\" alt=\"\"></a><span class=\"small\"><div class=\"photo-credit\">Credit: PellucidWombat</div></span>\r\n</div></td>\r\n			  <td class=\"sdw_right\"></td>\r\n			</tr>\r\n			<tr>\r\n			  <td><img src=\"/nav_img/bottom_left_sdw.gif\" width=\"13\" height=\"13\"></td>\r\n			  <td class=\"sdw_bottom\"></td>\r\n			  <td><img src=\"/nav_img/bottom_right_sdw.gif\" width=\"13\" height=\"13\"></td>\r\n			</tr>\r\n		  </table>\r\n</div>\r\n<br>\r\r\nThe only source of moisture on our gear was from perspiration this day as it felt hot &amp; humid. <br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\n<div class=\"photonormal\">\r\n<table valign=\"top\" border=\"0\" width=\"626\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" class=\"sdw_box\">\r\n			<tr>\r\n			  <td><img src=\"/nav_img/top_left_sdw.gif\" width=\"13\" height=\"13\"></td>\r\n			  <td class=\"sdw_top\"></td>\r\n			  <td><img src=\"/nav_img/top_right_sdw.gif\" width=\"13\" height=\"13\"></td>\r\n			</tr>\r\n			<tr>\r\n			  <td class=\"sdw_left\"></td>\r\n			  <td class=\"sdw_body\" width=\"600\"><div>\r\n<a href=\"javascript:photoZoom(\'Mjs7Ojc9IyQh\')\" title=\"Click to enlarge\"><img src=\"http://www.supertopo.com/photos/9/17/213270_26021_L.jpg\" width=\"600\" height=\"399\" name=\"\" alt=\"\"></a><span class=\"small\"><div class=\"photo-credit\">Credit: PellucidWombat</div></span>\r\n</div></td>\r\n			  <td class=\"sdw_right\"></td>\r\n			</tr>\r\n			<tr>\r\n			  <td><img src=\"/nav_img/bottom_left_sdw.gif\" width=\"13\" height=\"13\"></td>\r\n			  <td class=\"sdw_bottom\"></td>\r\n			  <td><img src=\"/nav_img/bottom_right_sdw.gif\" width=\"13\" height=\"13\"></td>\r\n			</tr>\r\n		  </table>\r\n</div>\r\n<br>\r\r\nWe made camp at about 7,400\' on lower Curtis Ridge and enjoyed some rock slabs that were perfect for lounging and taking in the views.

Storm arrival t-minus 1 hour.<br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\nWe moved at a snail\'s pace as we tired from the elevation and soft snow, but the snow kept getting softer and deeper. As I traversed over to the bergschrund crux, I was often digging through waist deep snow, right up to the ice pitch. By this time it was snowing hard and the wind was blowing around 30-40 mph. The ice pitch had a continual dumping of windblown snow that was sluffing off the slopes above. I got thoroughly drenched from these pervasive ice crystals as I climbed 1 pitch of ice through the whiteout, stopping every time snow poured down on me to brace myself and cinch up my hood. This pitch normally would have been pretty easy but conditions definitely added to the stress factor!<br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\nEric took the next trailbreaking lead and found another nice pitch of sustained 40 degree ice. Though exhausted at this point, I welcomed the ice for the break it provided from the soft snow. Plus it was fun! I finished another pitch of ice to the top of the route.<br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\nUnfortunately here the wind gusts picked up and visibility dropped to near zero. We had difficulty reaching the top of the Cap as a large bergschrund stopped us less than 100 ft from the top. Going left, it grew larger, so we backtracked to the right and end-ran it and were shortly on top of Liberty Cap.<br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\nThe problem at this point was that we could barely see the snow 1 or 2 steps in front of us. Despite having our waypoints for descent set in the GPS, that only helped us for the larger scale routefinding. We realized that we could easily walk off a cliff or into a crevasse with the visibility as bad as it was. We were both thoroughly soaked and becoming mildly hypothermic. I was covered in rime ice, already had the \"umbles\" and was beginning to get the \"stumbles\" and both Eric and I had been shivering non-stop for the past 3 or 4 hours.<br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\nThe last forecast we had seen showed the weather to dissipate Monday, so we decided it was best to set up shelter on the Cap to get warm &amp; rested, and attempt to descend once visibility improved a bit more.<br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\nWe dug a platform into the bergschrund wall that we had end-run and I built up some hardy wind walls. Despite the howling wind, the BD First Light we were using was pretty calm, and our biggest complaint was being buried from snow drifting over our tent. Eric took initiative and shoveled snow off the tent a couple of times throughout the night. <br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\nEverything in our packs was saturated, including our sleeping bags. Luckily neither of us was using down loft!

Rainier.  The path of Ptarmigan Ridge is less direct and the position less striking, and sadly the real climbing ends at a much lower altitude than Liberty Ridge (ca. 12,200’ rather than at Liberty Cap’s lofty 14,112’.) However, Ptarmigan Ridge offers more technical climbing, with steeper slopes, more ice, and a choice of two finishes: A less popular variation that climbs through an icefall to the left, and the standard right variation that ascends a chimney system through a rock band and requires some technical rock climbing on perhaps the only good rock on the mountain.<br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\n<b>Friday – “Mostly Sunny” Approach to Observation Camp</b><br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\n<div class=\"photonormal\">\r\n<table valign=\"top\" border=\"0\" width=\"626\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" class=\"sdw_box\">\r\n			<tr>\r\n			  <td><img src=\"/nav_img/top_left_sdw.gif\" width=\"13\" height=\"13\"></td>\r\n			  <td class=\"sdw_top\"></td>\r\n			  <td><img src=\"/nav_img/top_right_sdw.gif\" width=\"13\" height=\"13\"></td>\r\n			</tr>\r\n			<tr>\r\n			  <td class=\"sdw_left\"></td>\r\n			  <td class=\"sdw_body\" width=\"600\"><div>\r\n<a href=\"javascript:photoZoom(\'Mjs7NTY5ISMq\')\" title=\"Click to enlarge\"><img src=\"http://www.supertopo.com/photos/9/18/213295_27263_L.jpg\" width=\"600\" height=\"450\" name=\"\" alt=\"\"></a><span class=\"small\"><div class=\"photo-credit\">Credit: PellucidWombat</div></span>\r\n</div></td>\r\n			  <td class=\"sdw_right\"></td>\r\n			</tr>\r\n			<tr>\r\n			  <td><img src=\"/nav_img/bottom_left_sdw.gif\" width=\"13\" height=\"13\"></td>\r\n			  <td class=\"sdw_bottom\"></td>\r\n			  <td><img src=\"/nav_img/bottom_right_sdw.gif\" width=\"13\" height=\"13\"></td>\r\n			</tr>\r\n		  </table>\r\n</div>Vital gear for an alpine climb<br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\nAlthough it seems that most climbers these days climb the ridge after a long traverse across the Winthrop and Carbon Glaciers from the White River Trailhead, we opted for the original &amp; more scenic approach from Mowich Lake.

If it were composed of dog turd it may not have been so bad, but since it was actually composed of Cascade volcanic graham cracker, this made for some interesting class 2 scrambling with a heavy pack on. Though Anastasia was native to Portland and led WI4, somehow she has thus far avoided much of the loose rock in the Cascades, as she was scared stiff on this section. I just kicked down rocks and dug into the gravel until I got some small toe prints that would hold, and delicately moved across the terrain, telling her which rocks you can lean on, and reminding her to try to stay balanced on her feet and not lean in to pull on rocks. <br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\n<div class=\"photonormal\">\r\n<table valign=\"top\" border=\"0\" width=\"626\" cellspacing=\"0\"

Can You See the Climbers Ahead?<br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\nThere was one other party on the route that day, and they were about 1 hour and 1,000 ft ahead of us. As the sun cast brilliant alpenglow on the rocks above little bits of ice trickled down the slope as we simul-soloed up slopes of continuous slopes of 40 degree neve with occasional short bits of ice. At first I thought the ice trickles were knocked down by the other climbers, but eventually the trickles grew larger and some rocks started coming down with them – the sun was reaching the plastered rime on the cliffs above!<br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\nAnastasia seemed used to this and climbed on. Coming from the more solid ranges of the Sierra and the Wasatch, I’m not used to projectiles flying at me, so now it was my turn to be the shaky-legged one. Eventually I got used to it and learned to keep my eyes &amp; ears open to the sound of falling debris, and then tuck in my tools and keep my head down when the little barrage arrived. <br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\n<div class=\"photonormal\">\r\n<table valign=\"top\" border=\"0\" width=\"476\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" class=\"sdw_box\">\r\n			<tr>\r\n			  <td><img src=\"/nav_img/top_left_sdw.gif\" width=\"13\" height=\"13\"></td>\r\n			  <td class=\"sdw_top\"></td>\r\n			  <td><img src=\"/nav_img/top_right_sdw.gif\" width=\"13\" height=\"13\"></td>\r\n			</tr>\r\n			<tr>\r\n			  <td class=\"sdw_left\"></td>\r\n			  <td class=\"sdw_body\" width=\"450\"><div>\r\n<a href=\"javascript:photoZoom(\'Mjs0PT49JCEr\')\" title=\"Click to enlarge\"><img src=\"http://www.supertopo.com/photos/9/18/213326_22598_L.jpg\" width=\"450\" height=\"600\" name=\"\" alt=\"\"></a><span class=\"small\"><div class=\"photo-credit\">Credit: PellucidWombat</div></span>\r\n</div></td>\r\n			  <td class=\"sdw_right\"></td>\r\n			</tr>\r\n			<tr>\r\n			  <td><img src=\"/nav_img/bottom_left_sdw.gif\" width=\"13\" height=\"13\"></td>\r\n			  <td class=\"sdw_bottom\"></td>\r\n			  <td><img src=\"/nav_img/bottom_right_sdw.gif\" width=\"13\" height=\"13\"></td>\r\n			</tr>\r\n		  </table>\r\n</div>Rounding the Corner, About to Start the Steep Traverse<br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\nAlthough the climbing was still easy, we did start placing screws at this point as we were more worried about a fall caused by getting hit than by lack of technique.

I front-pointed and swung tools the entire way, but fortunately the ice was easy enough if you tested placements, so I only placed one stubby every 100 ft – just enough to keep one piece between us as we simul-climbed.<br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\n<div class=\"photonormal\">\r\n<table valign=\"top\" border=\"0\" width=\"626\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" class=\"sdw_box\">\r\n			<tr>\r\n			  <td><img src=\"/nav_img/top_left_sdw.gif\" width=\"13\" height=\"13\"></td>\r\n			  <td class=\"sdw_top\"></td>\r\n			  <td><img src=\"/nav_img/top_right_sdw.gif\" width=\"13\" height=\"13\"></td>\r\n			</tr>\r\n			<tr>\r\n			  <td class=\"sdw_left\"></td>\r\n			  <td class=\"sdw_body\" width=\"600\"><div>\r\n<a href=\"javascript:photoZoom(\'Mjs0PT45ISci\')\" title=\"Click to enlarge\"><img src=\"http://www.supertopo.com/photos/9/18/213327_27651_L.jpg\" width=\"600\" height=\"450\" name=\"\" alt=\"\"></a><span class=\"small\"><div class=\"photo-credit\">Credit: PellucidWombat</div></span>\r\n</div></td>\r\n			  <td class=\"sdw_right\"></td>\r\n			</tr>\r\n			<tr>\r\n			  <td><img src=\"/nav_img/bottom_left_sdw.gif\" width=\"13\" height=\"13\"></td>\r\n			  <td class=\"sdw_bottom\"></td>\r\n			  <td><img src=\"/nav_img/bottom_right_sdw.gif\" width=\"13\" height=\"13\"></td>\r\n			</tr>\r\n		  </table>\r\n</div>First Pitch of Sustained Ice After the Steep Traverse<br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\nNow it was getting fun as the slopes got icier and stayed in the 45-55 degree range.

I placed a cam to backup the hidden piton at the crux (we brought them so I might as well use them), and after a bit of stemming &amp; mantling I was above the rock band.<br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\nWe encountered one more pitch of ice above the rock and then the climb was over. It was only about noon and now we had a little under 2,000 ft of slogging up snow slopes to reach Liberty Cap, with only 1 bergschrund crossing to keep us entertained.<br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\n<b>Liberty Cap Strikes Again</b><br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\nMy first hint that we were in trouble was when we stopped to eat a snack after the last technical pitch. I had been concerned about moving fast earlier in the day, and as we put our packs down Anastasia said<br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\n\"See Mark, we weren\'t that slow. The team ahead of us is right there.\"<br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\nThe climbers ahead of us had pulled away during the first half of the route, and I doubted that we had caught up to them.<br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\n\"Where?\" I asked.<br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\n\"Right by the seracs over there,\" she replied.<br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\nI saw the seracs about 100 ft away, but there was no one there. Only footprints.<br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\n\"Anastasia, there is no one there.\"<br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\n\"Yes there is. I can see them moving!\"<br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\nUh oh. Anastasia was hallucinating. I asked her how she was feeling and she admitted to feeling a bit tired and sick. I suspected that she had AMS and that we needed to get down ASAP. However, the route is not one that is descended, so our only option was to climb another 2,000 ft higher to Liberty Cap and make the mile traverse above 13,500 ft to the Columbia Crest before we could even being descending again.<br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\nTo make matters worse, our sunny day had deteriorated into a mostly cloudy day, and the cloud level was at about 12,500 ft. It looked like I was in for another white-out traverse of the Cap.<br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\n<div class=\"photonormal\">\r\n<table valign=\"top\" border=\"0\" width=\"626\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" class=\"sdw_box\">\r\n			<tr>\r\n			  <td><img src=\"/nav_img/top_left_sdw.gif\" width=\"13\" height=\"13\"></td>\r\n			  <td class=\"sdw_top\"></td>\r\n			  <td><img src=\"/nav_img/top_right_sdw.gif\" width=\"13\" height=\"13\"></td>\r\n			</tr>\r\n			<tr>\r\n			  <td class=\"sdw_left\"></td>\r\n			  <td class=\"sdw_body\" width=\"600\"><div>\r\n<a href=\"javascript:photoZoom(\'Mjs0PT02KSAr\')\" title=\"Click to enlarge\"><img src=\"http://www.supertopo.com/photos/9/18/213336_12022_L.jpg\" width=\"600\" height=\"220\" name=\"\" alt=\"\"></a><span class=\"small\"><div class=\"photo-credit\">Credit: PellucidWombat</div></span>\r\n</div></td>\r\n			  <td class=\"sdw_right\"></td>\r\n			</tr>\r\n			<tr>\r\n			  <td><img src=\"/nav_img/bottom_left_sdw.gif\" width=\"13\" height=\"13\"></td>\r\n			  <td class=\"sdw_bottom\"></td>\r\n			  <td><img src=\"/nav_img/bottom_right_sdw.gif\" width=\"13\" height=\"13\"></td>\r\n			</tr>\r\n		  </table>\r\n</div>Anastasia Nearing the Bergschrund Crossing After We Finished the Technical Climbing. The whiteout awaits ahead . . .<br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\nAnastasia led out as I told her my suspicions and that we needed to get up and over the mountain fast. She got noticeably slower at this point, and by the time we reached 13,000 ft she plopped down and asked me to lead on. <br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\nThe higher we got the worse she got. At about 13,500 ft Anastasia started demanding that we stop and make camp and descend the next day on account of the whiteout and her feeling sick and exhausted. Although I was willing to stop with <a href=\"http://www.supertopo.com/tripreport/tripreport.php?articleid=11118\" target=\"_blank\">Eric on Liberty Cap</a>, in that circumstance I knew that we could recover and be stronger for a continued descent. In Anastasia\'s case, I knew that if her problem was AMS, if we stopped up high we would be in even worse condition to descend the next day.<br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\nAnastasia was too tired to care much about my concern, but I got her to keep going by giving her the rest of my food and water. By the time we got to Liberty Cap we were engaged in an tough case of tug of war, and every few minutes she stopped and tried to talk me into making camp.<br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\n\"We are not making camp until we at least reach 12,000 ft on the Emmons Glacier,\" I said. That would at least put us just below the elevation where Anastasia started having problems, and it would have us on one of the major trade routes where it would be easy to get assistance for descent if her AMS got worse. I also secretly hoped that if I got her that far we could finish the final relatively straightforward 2,000 ft descent to Camp Schurman.<br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\nFor a while Anastasia agreed to go along with my demand, but as she got more tired and sick, our pace slowed, and it became increasingly difficult to keep her moving. I felt bad about being so cruel in that respect, but I felt that we would be in serious trouble if we made camp, and that if she had enough energy to complain and argue, she had enough energy to keep moving.<br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\n\"Anastasia, we can rest all you need to keep moving, but we cannot stop and make camp.\" This worked for a while, and we spent about half the time resting as she tried to eat and drink. Eventually she stopped caring about getting down and became resistant to continuing on again. I (half bluffingly) said I would only be willing to make camp sooner than the Emmons Glacier if I called for rescue with my SPOT device and cell phone. This worked for a while longer as she was not willing to call for rescue yet and the terrain had flattened. Unfortunately it only got us to the saddle between Liberty Cap &amp; Columbia Crest, when we had to gain another 200\' to bypass the seracs that I knew were waiting for us above the Winthrop Glacier.<br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\nAnastasia was getting disoriented enough at this point that she was getting lost, despite being tied into me! The clouds were so thick she couldn\'t see me at the end of the rope and couldn\'t make sense of the rope tension. She also fell into a small crevasse as she was no longer really looking out for herself. I brought in coils, increasing the danger of one of us pulling the other into a crevasse in hopes that she could better follow me and I could better point out crevasses I found probing. I knew that if I fell into one I would be on my own, so I moved very carefully. Visibility was as bad as when I had crossed the Cap with Eric the <a href=\"http://www.supertopo.com/tripreport/tripreport.php?articleid=11118\" target=\"_blank\">weekend prior</a>, and although I had our GPS track, it was still very difficult to stay on course with all of these other curve balls thrown into the scene.<br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\nAfter an interminable amount of time and bickering as she continued to resist pushing on, we finally reached the Emmons Glacier. For a while she improved as we descended. As I had hoped, we came across a climbing party, and although we seemed to be moving OK by this time, I asked them to tell the rangers at Camp Schurman about our situation, and that we might need assistance in the morning to finish descending.<br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\nWe barely made it to 12,000 ft by sunset. By this point Anastasia was deteriorating again as she began throwing up the food she was trying to eat, and was falling down uncontrollably. After hopping across one crevasse on a slope, she fell down and almost slid into the next crevasse downhill before self-arresting. I <i>REALLY</i> needed a second climber to help short-rope her! I didn\'t want to stop with her due to her condition, but between her begging to stop again, the fall and approaching darkness, I relented and chopped out a ledge with my ice tool and set up the tent.<br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\nFortunately, despite Anastasia being so uncooperative and me being so unsympathetic to her pleas, we made amends and Anastasia admitted that as much as I was being a jerk, she was being stubborn and it was good that we had pressed on to get to where we were. I had my first bit of food &amp; drink since topping out on Ptarmigan Ridge 9 hours earlier (it normally takes 3 hrs to cover the same terrain) and went to sleep.<br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\n<b>Monday – The Joys of Bottled Oxygen and Rescuers</b><br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\n\"Mark! I\'m feeling a lot worse. We have to go down now!\"<br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\nI woke to Anastasia\'s call for help at 1am. As I had feared, 12,000 ft was not low enough for her to improve, and although the initial rest had helped, now she was feeling a lot worse. At this point I knew that we were in an easy location for calling for assistance, that daylight wasn\'t too long away, and it would probably be safer at this point to hold tight until daylight and send for help instead of descending.<br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\n<div class=\"photonormal\">\r\n<table valign=\"top\" border=\"0\" width=\"626\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" class=\"sdw_box\">\r\n			<tr>\r\n			  <td><img src=\"/nav_img/top_left_sdw.gif\" width=\"13\" height=\"13\"></td>\r\n			  <td class=\"sdw_top\"></td>\r\n			  <td><img src=\"/nav_img/top_right_sdw.gif\" width=\"13\" height=\"13\"></td>\r\n			</tr>\r\n			<tr>\r\n			  <td class=\"sdw_left\"></td>\r\n			  <td class=\"sdw_body\" width=\"600\"><div>\r\n<a href=\"javascript:photoZoom(\'Mjs0PTo8JiYi\')\" title=\"Click to enlarge\"><img src=\"http://www.supertopo.com/photos/9/18/213337_10893_L.jpg\" width=\"600\" height=\"436\" name=\"\" alt=\"\"></a><span class=\"small\"><div class=\"photo-credit\">Credit: PellucidWombat</div></span>\r\n</div></td>\r\n			  <td class=\"sdw_right\"></td>\r\n			</tr>\r\n			<tr>\r\n			  <td><img src=\"/nav_img/bottom_left_sdw.gif\" width=\"13\" height=\"13\"></td>\r\n			  <td class=\"sdw_bottom\"></td>\r\n			  <td><img src=\"/nav_img/bottom_right_sdw.gif\" width=\"13\" height=\"13\"></td>\r\n			</tr>\r\n		  </table>\r\n</div>Anastasia on Oxygen During Our Assisted Descent<br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\nFortunately within an hour climbing ranger Nick Hall and 3 volunteers had arrived.

We made it to the ranger shelter without incident and spent the rest of the day eating and hydrating. Anastasia\'s dizziness and nausea dissipated and by the afternoon we were released and descended to the White River trail head.<br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\n<b>Reflections</b><br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\nI had been worried about whether I had taken the best action given our circumstances, as obviously I was pushing Anastasia very hard to keep moving, and we were at high risk for having an accident by doing so. It was relieving to hear from the rescuers that our decision to push forward up and over the Cap and to make it to where we did was probably the best one in a situation where there was no ideal solution. It was really good that we didn\'t stop higher as well because the sunny forecast for that week had changed again to a stormy one and it rained and snowed for the next several days on the mountain.<br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\nAnastasia had ascended Mt Rainier at least 4 times prior and had been above 14,000 ft on a few peaks in California, all without incident. Between her history at altitude and a moderately acclimatized ascent (one night at 8,000 ft &amp; one at 10,300 ft), Anastasia\'s sudden development of AMS was a huge surprise to everyone including her. <br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\nFortunately, we were as reasonably prepared as one could be for such an epic, we had made good decisions with what was available to us.  Although she will be more wary of ascending to high altitude as fast again and may start using some Diamox preemptively, Anastasia wasn\'t at all deterred from her alpine passions. Two weeks later she climbed the Price Glacier on Mt Shuksan (IV, AI3 cl.4-5).<br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\n<b>Gear Notes:</b><br>\r\r\nWe brought 4 stubby ice screws, 2 screamers, and 2 pickets. In icy conditions like we had, 8 screws would be better for longer simul-climbing pitches and better anchors.  Bring 1-3 cams of 0.5”-1” for the rock pitch (optional - fixed piton may suffice for many).<br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\n<b>Approach Notes:</b><br>\r\r\nWhite River Approach is preferred by many since you can do a round trip from the same trailhead. However, you have a LONG traverse crossing the Winthrop and Carbon Glaciers, requiring roped glacier travel and navigating crevasses. This approach becomes harder in later season and might be impassable as the glaciers open up.<br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\nThe Mowich Approach requires leaving a car at White River TH and then driving 2 hrs to the Mowich TH.  However, this approach is more scenic, the lower camp has running water, and you don’t need to get out the rope until you start climbing above high camp.<br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\nBoth approaches merge just before the final loose knife edge section of ridge before the high camp. This section is better earlier in the season when it still has snow cover. In later season you can drop down to the east on snow to bypass loose rock &amp; a rock step, but by late season this might be melted out.

Looking at the topo, it looked like I could link pitches 11 &amp; 12 as their length was 180 ft in total, I was partway up pitch 11, and I had a 230 ft range. <br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\nIt turns out this wasn\'t the case. Maybe it was because I did a lot of wandering back &amp; forth to avoid knocking down loose rocks onto myself or Chris belaying in the chute (beware where your belay for this pitch is set up!), but I ran out of rope at the ledge just below the \"steep and sustained 5.7\" in the topo. I didn\'t knock off any rocks myself, but apparently despite my efforts, my rope still dislodged some rocks towards Chris, but fortunately they sailed clear. <br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\n<b>Jenga Challenge</b><br>\r\r\nNear the end of the pitch I had a good scare and perhaps quintessential Temple Crag experience. I was pulling up into a groove when I hit my head on a Frisbee-sized rock, knocking it off. I pinched it against the cliffside as it landed on my leg (ouch!). <br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\nAs I struggled to get in a better jam to steady myself to deal with my latest catch, I almost pulled on a triangular flake the size of a microwave that was detached and leaning against the cliff ready to tip off on my head. I thrust my hand deeper in the corner crack and in the process knocked out a CD-sized rock, caught it in mid-air in my free lower hand, then thrust it back in the crack. It rolled into a deeper section and right back out a lower opening like stubborn quarters in a vending machine, bringing another CD-sized rock with it. This happened several times before I tried other stacking strategies. I piled these in my hand and realized that I was now holding 3 rocks from plummeting onto Chris while in a tenuous stance on a single jam, and my last piece of pro was perhaps 20 ft below.<br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\nAfter an unknown amount of strenuous time I finally got in a piece of pro at my stance, jammed the CD-sized rocks back into the hole from whence they came, and reinserted the largest Jenga piece back into the Temple Crag Puzzle as securely as I could. It still stuck out like a lever &amp; wobbled, but at least I could let go.<br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\nOnce the rope ran out, I belayed just below a very steep wall with a splitter crack and belayed Chris up. I warned her of the sketchy section and she managed to avoid the loose rock as she came up. Fortunately from here the rock got much better and the steep splitter crack turned out to be fairly easy, as the last two pitches had left me pretty tired :-)<br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\n<b>Upper Ridge</b><br>\r\r\nThe upper ridge had mostly solid rock and a lot of exposed class 4 moves along a knife-edge.<br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\n<i>Along this section we saw a team of 3 climbing on VBA, but far below the crest. As far as I could tell, they must have taken what I labeled \"False VBA\" in the route drawing, as this looked liked a good candidate from the cl. 3 ledges, they were just above where this sub-arete peters out and they seemed to be aiming for the VBA crest.</i><br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\n<div class=\"photonormal\">\r\n<table valign=\"top\" border=\"0\" width=\"626\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" class=\"sdw_box\">\r\n			<tr>\r\n			  <td><img src=\"/nav_img/top_left_sdw.gif\" width=\"13\" height=\"13\"></td>\r\n			  <td class=\"sdw_top\"></td>\r\n			  <td><img src=\"/nav_img/top_right_sdw.gif\" width=\"13\" height=\"13\"></td>\r\n			</tr>\r\n			<tr>\r\n			  <td class=\"sdw_left\"></td>\r\n			  <td class=\"sdw_body\" width=\"600\"><div>\r\n<a href=\"javascript:photoZoom(\'Mjk5Pjo4ICIh\')\" title=\"Click to enlarge\"><img src=\"http://www.supertopo.com/photos/9/64/217950_1816_L.jpg\" width=\"600\" height=\"450\" name=\"\" alt=\"Upper section of MGA, seen from VBA the following day.

Rock! Rock!\"<br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\nI\'ve learned from climbing in the Canadian Rockies that the best way to deal with rockfall when you are far below is to stand still and watch the rocks. Once they are almost at your level, you should then decide whether to stay put or run like hell to the left or right. This is because the rocks can ricochet at the last minute and if you run too soon you can\'t see what the rocks are doing and you might actually run into the line of fire.<br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\nSo I stood and watched. The basketball-sized rock seemed to be falling to the right as expected, but I kept watching. Once it was within about 50 ft of me it started curving my way and then hit a bump, bouncing over to my side of the apron crest and towards the debris chute for the ledges access that I was standing in. <br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\nRUUUUN! I sprinted to my right and out of the way, then climbed the snow as quickly as I could to get out of the way of any more potential rockfall.<br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\n<i>I found out later that the culprit was my friend Chris D and Bryan B. :-P</i><br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\nToday I climbed up the debris chute in the snow to the moat beside the ledges to gain them, and this turned out to be much easier and more secure than the direct line I took across the blank snow yesterday.

According to Ed Hartouni\'s quote from the Roper Guide, it is an acronym that stands for \"Right Of Reed Pinnacle\". The route caught my eye one day while browsing the Reid guide. According to the topo, 6 moderate pitches of mostly crack climbing would take one up the center of the cliff, just short of the top, making the route one of the longest at Reed Pinnacle. <br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\nVenturing up this route, I wasn\'t disappointed. Although it was a little dirty, the route offers burly, old-school 5.7 chimney &amp; offwidth climbing that is probably more appropriate for 5.8 leaders accustomed to wide techniques. The views are nice, and the final pitch was great (left variation) - I\'d say 4-5 stars on the Taco rating. Overall I\'d give the route 3 stars.<br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\nI first attempted to climb the route in January, choosing to try out the first 3 pitches of Flatus as a more direct start instead of climbing the easier &amp; dirtier first 2 pitches of the standard route. This start was a great route - clean rock with sustained and burly 5.9 climbing and interesting moves. The route also lived up to its name, as each pitch seemed capable of making a climber blow out some <a href=\"http://www.thefreedictionary.com/flatus\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">flatus</a>.<br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\nUnfortunately my partner was new to wide climbing, and was utterly spent after the 3 pitches. <br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\n<img src=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-kJ9Vbqz3lPQ/TxpnIUwJ_oI/AAAAAAAA7FM/Aq9xCHbLdSE/s600/2012-01-15%2520-%252021%2520-%2520Flatus%2520-%2520Hubert%2520Finishing%2520P3.jpg\"><br>\r\r\n<i>Hubert escaping the 5.7 chimney on P3 of Flatus</i><br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\nI returned another weekend with my friend Jared Wood, a partner more accustomed to wide climbing. Not wanting to take any chances, we decided to follow the standard line.<br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\n<b>Pitch 1 (5.5)</b><br>\r\r\n<img src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-xnjTjIERA1k/Ty_tj_9EYSI/AAAAAAAA8JY/yldqPB1RJXw/s600/2012-02-04%2520-%252006%2520-%2520The%2520Rorp%2520-%2520P1%2520Start.jpg\"><br>\r\r\n<i>The route gets right to business, starting with an easy chimney.</i> <br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\nDon\'t take the more inviting crack on the left. It is harder than it looks. Instead, take the dirt &amp; root-filled corner to your right. No pro is available, but the climbing is easy enough. The crux of this pitch was keeping dirt out of my eyes. <br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\n<img src=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-n1Yz79fIJFM/Ty_tkcnoSVI/AAAAAAAA8JY/aaAbgmOEasU/s600/2012-02-04%2520-%252007%2520-%2520The%2520Rorp%2520-%2520P1%2520Decision%2520Go%2520Right.jpg\"><br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\nThe topo indicates belaying above the corner, but if you\'re careful with drag, you can link both pitches. At the very least I recommend continuing up the gully to the right to the sling anchors atop P2 of Stone Groove for a sunnier belay with better views. Don\'t take the more inviting cracks to the left or directly above unless you want to go off  route.<br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\n<img src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-Cws9gSkeurA/TxpnE8DpZuI/AAAAAAAA7AI/dpcJvIEnJGc/s600/2012-01-15%2520-%252012%2520-%2520Flatus%2520-%2520P1%25262%2520of%2520the%2520Rorp.jpg\"><br>\r\r\nGulley on P2.<br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\nI had to stop at the top of P2 of Stone Groove as I had left my #5 C4 with Jared and it was obvious that I would need it to protect the next section.<br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\n<img src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-GNb_dtCn5sE/Ty_tlhWp_gI/AAAAAAAA8JY/3CkIVfxVwYg/s600/2012-02-04%2520-%252009%2520-%2520The%2520Rorp%2520-%2520P2%2520OW.jpg\"><br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\n<b>Pitch 2 (5.5?)</b><br>\r\r\nI actually thought this was one of the harder pitches of the climb, even though the topo only showed it as a 5.5 crack. Relative to the rest of the route I\'d call it 5.7 OW. Maybe I climbed it wrong? :-P<br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\nThis pitch was actually pretty fun, with clean rock and sustained climbing. I placed a #4 to start and stemmed the lower section. I climbed the upper part as an off-width, arm-barring and stacking hands as I pumped up with my feet and leapfrogged my #5 with me. Since I had 2 #5s, I left one, which made the pro pretty chill. Keep in mind that if you only bring one, the pitch might feel a little runout, and it will be one of only 3 pieces placed (1 #4, 1 #5, and 1 #2 to protect the exit). There are some nice rapp bolts to belay from at the top.<br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\n<img src=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-lQqMROFeivA/TxpnKoc0-eI/AAAAAAAA7B0/jvlWGhMVwuw/s600/2012-01-15%2520-%252026%2520-%2520P2%2520of%2520The%2520Rorp.jpg\"><br>\r\r\n<i>Upper part of P2 seen while rappelling on an earlier foray up to the big ledge.</i><br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\n<b>Pitch 3 (5.6)</b><br>\r\r\nPitch 3 is where the route really begins.

Apparently there is a 5.8 bolted face variation that bypasses the P3 5.7 chimney, but I found the chimney pretty fun&amp; secure (1 piece of pro in crack near chockstones). You still have to walk a little bit to get to the P3 start, which is accessed by walking right and then back left up a cl. 3 step with a fixed line.<br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\n<img src=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-Nvl3ed43iqg/Txpm-l3LaII/AAAAAAAA6-o/01smPLsBQl0/s600/2012-01-15%2520-%252001%2520-%2520Flatus%2520-%2520P1.jpg\"><br>\r\r\n<i>Pitch 1 (5.9 for direct-left variation)</i><br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\n<img src=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-9nCr63PDi8M/TxpnBPYyY9I/AAAAAAAA6_I/nYEzgOoApcg/s600/2012-01-15%2520-%252005%2520-%2520Flatus%2520-%2520P2%2520%2526%2520Hubert.jpg\"><br>\r\r\n<i>Pitch 2 (5.9 route crux)</i><br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\n<img src=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-OautMfXWDoM/TxpnFcAVD-I/AAAAAAAA7AM/B6X9sIbM1Xw/s600/2012-01-15%2520-%252013%2520-%2520Flatus%2520-%2520P3%25205_7%2520chimney.jpg\"><br>\r\r\n<i>Pitch 3 (5.7)</i><br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\n2.

My fondest childhood memories came from the many trips my dad and I used to take from Salt Lake City to the trinity of Utah desert fun: Arches NP, Canyonlands NP, and the San Rafael Swell. I have hiked, scrambled, and canyoneered many miles in this wonderful landscape with my dad. I also did my first +18 hr day and +20 mile dayhike here. My realization that I could work through my fear of heights with a rope occurred while rappelling on a backpacking trip with my dad as we descended into one of the desert canyons.<br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\nI never had a chance to enjoy the desert as climber, though. <br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\n<img src=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-3obekmNI2Rg/Tt3295QgTNI/AAAAAAAA4pU/8p-mh5jt1wQ/s912/2011-11-26%2520-%2520121%2520-%2520Ancient%2520Art%2520Summits%2520from%2520the%2520East.jpg\"><br>\r\r\n<i>Summit spires of Ancient Art from the NE with climbers on pitch 3</i><br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\n<img src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-ArNbiUJGNWQ/Tt330-xqYxI/AAAAAAAA4tg/SiN2ALFw4Vs/s600/2011-11-27%2520-%252006a%2520-%2520Climbers%2520on%2520Ancient%2520Art%2520Summit.jpg\"><br>\r\r\n<i>Climbers on Ancient Art at the crux, seen from the parking lot (the SW).</i><br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\nFast forward to 2011. I have been been climbing on and off for a number of years, and have been going for about a year on a lead climbing binge, climbing nearly every weekend. Unfortunately, while I\'ve been getting out and enjoying nature more than ever, my father\'s Parkinsons disease has by this time progressed to the point that he can only manage shorter walks than in my teen years, and his tremors preclude the possibility of any scrambling. I nearly overdid it when I suggested we hike Mt. Elbert together, which led to some dangerous freeze-related falls when descending the trail as he fatigued from the hike. <br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\n<img src=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-Ltd42j3miiQ/TthDCu_LHyI/AAAAAAAA9ns/zs5TxbanJwI/s600/2011-11-25%2520-%252008%2520-%2520Me%2520%2526%2520Dad%2520at%2520Camp%2520-%2520by%2520Pete.jpg\"><br>\r\r\n<i>Dad &amp; Me at our Indian Creek campsite</i><br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\nIn an attempt to find a way to continue sharing our enjoyment of nature with each other, while letting out some of my pent up energy, I suggested that my dad come along on some of my shorter rock climbs to lounge at the base of the cliffs where he could watch me climb. He\'s not a technical climber, so I figured I could share my new outdoor passion with him while finding a way for us to be outside together. We could walk to and from the climbs together, he could chat with me or my climbing partner while we were belaying on the ground, and he should be able to hear and watch us throughout the shorter climbs. What could possibly be a bad idea about that? :-)<br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\n<u><b>Little Cottonwood Canyon Trad (June, 2011)</b></u><br>\r\r\n<b>A Crack in the Woods (5.8) &amp; Hand Jive (5.9)</b><br>\r\r\nI tried this idea out in Little Cottonwood Canyon in June with my friend Alec L.

As I\'m still new to leading 5.10s, I don\'t know why I thought it was a good idea to climb this route in front of my dad. Since all of the other climbers were pumping out and having to hang or aid on the upper crack, I was surprised to find the climbing onto the lower pedestal to be the crux.

The biggest pump I got was attempting to clip the rope with nearly 100\' of it hanging free below me. I learned quickly to place a piece high, move a couple more jams to keep the hand flexing &amp; relaxing, then clip the rope to the piece with the hand that was not placing the cam, now at waist level. This allowed me to avoid hanging out too long and divide the pro placement &amp; upper jam hang work between the two arms.<br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\n<img src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-NotH-6PL4zY/T2GZ5nenqOI/AAAAAAAA-84/hzVnXlJeiPc/s600/2011-11-25%2520-%252081%2520-%2520Supercrack%2520-%2520Lead-annotated.jpg\"><br>\r\r\n<i>View from the top after 80\' of glorious sustained hand &amp; fist jamming.</i><br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\n<img src=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-JDnlvtrVCOE/TthD000hb-I/AAAAAAAA3yc/bexa93uFpqQ/s600/2011-11-25%2520-%252083%2520-%2520Supercrack%2520-%2520Clean.jpg\"><br>\r\r\n<i>Cleaning on rappel.</i><br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\n<img src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-2lCHtoaUdts/TthD1Ql5cuI/AAAAAAAA3yg/pNjgRwS4caM/s600/2011-11-25%2520-%252084%2520-%2520Supercrack%2520-%2520Clean.jpg\"><br>\r\r\n<i>Nicely buffed crack of Supercrack. 100\' of sustained jamming - no rests unless you can rest in the jams!</i><br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\n<img src=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-iwnpve641Vc/TthD153S6JI/AAAAAAAA3yk/UqT3butZsG8/s600/2011-11-25%2520-%252085%2520-%2520Supercrack%2520-%2520Clean.jpg\"><br>\r\r\n<i>The nicely buffed interior of Supercrack in the #3 BD Camalot zone.</i><br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\n<u><b>Ancient Art (November, 2011)</b></u><br>\r\r\nThe coolest summit I had ever stood atop up to this point was Starlight Pk (14,200\'). <br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\n<img src=\"http://www.summitpost.org/images/medium/632950.jpg\"><br>\r\r\n<i>Manly pose atop The Milk Bottle (Photo by Steph Abegg)</i><br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\nWhile the silly summit outfit may have been vital to my success on Starlight, and although I lacked the Gandelf costume or giant Dr. Seuss hat that I envisioned wearing atop Ancient Art, I felt ready to lead the even wilder corkscrew summit.<br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\n<img src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-XLcR9Y85sR8/Tt32ZtQvLLI/AAAAAAAA4lI/NzBdQw-CrOA/s600/2011-11-26%2520-%2520059%2520-%2520Stolen%2520Chimney%2520-%2520Ancient%2520Art%2520Summit.jpg\"><br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\n<img src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-EoWDzgkCy7g/Tt34B7imjDI/AAAAAAAA4uQ/2o4htWFqNUo/s600/2011-11-27%2520-%252016%2520-%2520Fisher%2520Towers.jpg\"><br>\r\r\n<i>Fisher Towers.

Then each climber took their leap of fate and quickly deployed.<br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\n<img src=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-y_nO0V5ZTsQ/Tt32OifRtDI/AAAAAAAA4kg/1y7tcmiCs2Y/s600/2011-11-26%2520-%2520051%2520-%2520Stolen%2520Chimney%2520-%2520Base%2520Jumper%25201.jpg\"><br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\nThe deployment of the parasails in the amphitheater made quite a loud bang! There were some hikers with a dog below, and with each jump the poor dog made yelping noises like it was shocked to see these bodies hurtling towards their imminent death. Then once they sailed off to safety, the tone of the barking changed more to a higher pitched yipping, as if the dog were excited or confused at the spectacle.<br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\n<img src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-wu27JysIZpY/Tt32PFP9cOI/AAAAAAAA4kk/0nKqytlDyww/s600/2011-11-26%2520-%2520052%2520-%2520Stolen%2520Chimney%2520-%2520Base%2520Jumper%25202.jpg\"><br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\nI figured it was a good thing to have the base jumpers ahead of us. Although my dad had his concerns about the safety &amp; sanity of rock climbing, at least now I had some concrete examples that I wasn\'t the craziest one here! :-D<br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\n<img src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-I57WNpC5r_8/Tt32R3bO7CI/AAAAAAAA4ks/kRV_FRXcoR4/s600/2011-11-26%2520-%2520054%2520-%2520Stolen%2520Chimney%2520-%2520Base%2520Jumper%25202.jpg\"><br>\r\r\n<i>Base jumpers on Ancient Art!</i><br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\n<b>Pitch 3</b><br>\r\r\nThe third pitch was the one I was most concerned about. Discussions on MountainProject mentioned that the first of 3 bolts had pulled out on this pitch, and as of several years later still had not been replaced. <br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\n<img src=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-lhukQ-gzZK4/Tt32NyZXsxI/AAAAAAAA4kY/KVtnGWEqQkc/s600/2011-11-26%2520-%2520049%2520-%2520Stolen%2520Chimney%2520-%2520P3.jpg\"><br>\r\r\n<i>P3 of Stolen Chimney (5.9-5.10ish). The first bolt was pulled out, so you had to run it out a bit. Cl. 4 to the first remaining bolt.</i><br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\nI placed a cam between a detached flake and the rock wall (heh, yeah right) and scrambled up a bit higher. I could see the old bolt hole, and really it only saved you about a half body length of additional class 4 scrambling.<br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\nI clipped the rope to the first bolt and started face climbing, as my topo called this pitch 5.9 (SuperTopo calls it 5.10d). I started into a move and just could not find a final secure hold to move up on. I thought for a while, and decided that maybe since the first bolt had pulled out, and my dad was watching, that perhaps now was not the best time to be taking risks. Plus I had already french freed on P1, and this sandstone face climbing seemed like something I wouldn\'t mind missing, so I yarded on the cam as a jug and moved up to clip the next bolt.<br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\n<img src=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-5JCOa0UJ1tI/Tt32S4bwbAI/AAAAAAAA4k0/KqCov7Gg3AU/s600/2011-11-26%2520-%2520055a%2520-%2520Stolen%2520Chimney%2520-%2520Leading%2520P3.jpg\"><br>\r\r\n<i>Leading P3 of Stolen Chimney (5.9-5.10ish).

There was even a notch where the ridge dropped down a bit, which I shamefully downclimbed instead of just stepping down.<br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\n<img src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-JbN0TMAb9kk/Tt32a7qeh8I/AAAAAAAA4lM/Mk8U3Lgrx-M/s600/2011-11-26%2520-%2520060%2520-%2520Stolen%2520Chimney%2520-%2520Catwalk.jpg\"><br>\r\r\n<i>Exposed catwalk leading to the Ancient Art corkscrew summit spire! Stepping across and down over the little notch was slightly scary. No pro until you climb atop the camel head!</i><br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\nMy guidebook showed a bolt at the very tip of the camelhead thingy. Happy days! I just had to make it to that cantilevered block. To my dismay, once I got there I didn\'t see any bolt. I did, however, see a pair of fixed pieces at the base of the protruding rock, but I would either have to mantel the block, or traverse the left side where maybe I could reach the \"bolts\".<br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\nI chose to undercling the camel head and shuffle to the shaft of the spire. The bolts were still out of reach, requiring a committing 5.7 stemming &amp; mantel move to reach. Falling here would send you on a very big pendulum directly off the belay before you smacked into the tower. I\'m guessing I was about 20 ft or so out from the belay. Now why did I decide to do this climb with my dad watching?<br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\nThe move seemed secure enough, so I carefully climbed up the head.<br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\n<img src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-rgoyfdmQ86g/Tt32ctQfOqI/AAAAAAAA4lU/zudJNcVkeBw/s720/2011-11-26%2520-%2520061a%2520-%2520Stolen%2520Chimney%2520-%2520First%2520Pro.jpg\"><br>\r\r\n<i>Confidence-inspiring pro: A drilled angle and a star bolt with an aluminum hanger.

Yeah, I was feeling pretty confident at leading 5.9, but that has been on crack climbs in Yosemite granite. I\'ve been avoiding face climbs like the plague, and this one was a tad gritty and overhanging. Also, overhangs and exposure get to me.<br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\n<img src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-ehNwLi4i70g/Tt32dWzUdKI/AAAAAAAA4wA/tKfewqYAct0/s600/2011-11-26%2520-%2520063%2520-%2520Stolen%2520Chimney%2520-%2520Looking%2520Back%2520on%2520Catwalk.jpg\"><br>\r\r\n<i>Looking back at Peter before launching into the summit crux</i><br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\nWhat am I doing here?

They seemed somewhat secure, with some sloper holds in buckets to pull on and a nice vertical pincher between the holes to grab as I advanced my stem up a step. From there I should be able to reach past the overhang. I just hoped the higher edges were positive for a secure finish!<br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\n<img src=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-9WlK9fZ4MR4/T2GCIplsY3I/AAAAAAAA-74/eJJXOfW5f3E/s900/2011-11-26%2520-%2520066a%2520-%2520Stolen%2520Chimney%2520-%2520Leading%2520the%2520Crux%2520-%2520by%2520Dad-annotation.jpg\"><br>\r\r\n<i>Leading the summit crux.

I would have none of it. He has always been the bolder climber in my mind, and as he led mid-10s on sport, he should be able to handle the 5.9 crux on top-rope. I couldn\'t let him miss out on such an amazing summit! After a bit of cajoling I talked Pete into being willing to follow on TR to the summit after I got back to the belay (note, that with the constant traversing nature of this pitch, it is only mildly more secure for the follower than the leader).<br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\n<img src=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-konr8gzNzro/Tt32ncuObCI/AAAAAAAA4mg/mSFDxPdj8y4/s600/2011-11-26%2520-%2520078%2520-%2520Stolen%2520Chimney%2520-%2520Other%2520Ancient%2520Art%2520Summits.jpg\"><br>\r\r\n<i>Other Ancient Art summits.

Although he did say that at some moments he was a bit worried, I jokingly tried to ease his concern by saying that hopefully the worst judgment I exercised in my climbing was having a parent along to watch! <br>\r\r\n:-P<br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\n<u><b>Other Pretty Fisher Tower Pictures</b></u><br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\nAfter climbing Ancient Art, the three of us walked out to the end of the trail for more spectacular views of the Fisher Towers and to see the Titan up close (I\'d love to climb it someday). Later that night, with temperatures hovering just below freezing, I left the campsite and returned to the trail, armed with my DSLR, 2 bottles of Sierra Nevada beer, and Roper\'s \"Camp 4\" book to spend the night reading and tending the camera as I gradually worked my way back along the trail taking night photos. I brought a puffy jacket, puffy pants and bivy sack  to stay warm and comfy while lying around waiting for the long exposures to finish (The bivy sack was a bit much and served better as a pillow while reading).<br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\n<b>The Cobra</b><br>\r\r\nThis has got to be the coolest tower in the Fisher Towers, maybe only second to Ancient Art.

Somehow during the planning stages I had noted the route as a Grade IV climb, so although we were expecting a very long day, we brought along food &amp; water &amp; chose a start time assuming a Grade IV route. Add a recent early season snow storm to make the route more wintery, and getting lost on the descent, and you have a full value Type II Fun alpine climb!<br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\n<img src=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-1wjNEpGCvgg/T31nLJ408DI/AAAAAAABAys/NTTuacHPWzA/s640/2010-09-11%2520-%252009%2520-%2520Lone%2520Pine%2520Peak%2520N%2520%2526%2520NE%2520Ridges%2520-%2520annotated.jpg\"><br>\r\r\n<i>N &amp; NE Ridges of Lone Pine Peak</i><br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\nThe route starts at the Lone Pine Campround at 5,900\' and follows the ridge to the summit at 12,942\', gaining just over 7,000 ft. If you count the ups &amp; downs on the climb then we easily did 8,000 ft of gain. About 4,000 ft and 1.6 miles of that was scrambling to technical climbing. You come out near Whitney Portal, so you need to plan on how to get back to your car or be ready for a long walk.<br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\n<img src=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-BjVqA8l15ho/T35UFjwEKXI/AAAAAAABA0c/ELwz0zfPYxI/s640/2011-10-22%2520-%252013a%2520-%2520LPP%2520from%2520lower%2520NRoLPP%2520-%2520annotated%2520-%2520cropped.jpg\"><br>\r\r\n<i>Close up of the upper North Ridge of Lone Pine Peak. I still can’t tell where we went on the final wall.</i><br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\nThe upper section of the North Ridge is what most people climb. This is accessed as a round-trip outing from the Meyson Lake trailhead and a cl. 2-3 scramble up a chute to the west before it meets the main route at the Notch at 11,500’, where the first section of 5th class is encountered. This is typically done as a full day outing car-to-car, with the route rated III 5.5-5.7 (it seems that no one has been able to find anything easier than 5.7 while staying anywhere near the ridge). Most of the route is cl. 4 to low 5th and is conducive to simul-climbing or soloing. The crux is the final 600’ or so climb directly to the summit.<br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\n<u><b>The Plan</b></u><br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\n<img src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-87uPatHuZ9k/T35jJtrGrjI/AAAAAAABA1I/EJO181ZMbeI/s640/Lone%2520Pine%2520Peak%2520-%2520Complete%2520North%2520Ridge%2520Topo%2520Map.jpg\"><br>\r\r\n<i>Topo map of our planned climb on the N Ridge of Lone Pine Peak</i><br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\nStefan and I planned to climb the CNRoLPP in one continuous push from the valley floor. We each brought along about 3.5 liters of water and about 1,400 calories of snacks for the day (including breakfast). A bike was left hidden at the Meyson Lakes TH so that one of us could ride back down to the valley to fetch the car at the end of the climb. With forecast nighttime lows in the mid-20s and the likelihood of snow on the route from an early-season snow storm, we brought light gloves, puffy jackets and mid-weight boots. <br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\nAlthough the lower section of the ridge was terra incognita for us, we assumed it would mostly be 3rd class and fine to solo, so we planned to start at 5am, ideally reach the Notch by Noon at the latest, and solo or simul-climb most of the route. The descent looked to be straightforward according to the guidebooks and what we could find online, so we expected to descend in the dark on a straightforward route. <br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\n<u><b>Hour 0 (5:30 am, 5.900’) - Start</b></u> <br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\n<img src=\"http://lh6.ggpht.com/-wQ_fAG3umh4/T309YPZ4ebI/AAAAAAABAu4/P7faXOgbD7E/s640/2011-10-21%252520-%25252002a%252520-%252520LPP%252520from%252520Alabama%252520Hills.jpg\"><br>\r\r\n<i>Lone Pine Peak seen from the Alabama Hills at night.</i><br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\nWe slept out in the Alabama Hills, where I couldn’t resist taking some night photos. By the time we had cached the bike &amp; were ready to go, we starting about a half hour later than expected, but still in full darkness. <br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\nThe lower section passed quickly as we hiked up a combination of dirt roads &amp; trails, taking care not to take the wrong branch. This was followed by a couple thousand feet of sandy slogging that was more reminiscent of climbing up a powdery snow slope than a Fall climb! Fortunately the brush was easy enough to navigate around, so there really was no bushwhacking.<br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\n<u><b>Hour 1.5 (7:05 am. 9,400’) - Alpenglow on Whitney</b></u> <br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\n<img src=\"http://lh3.ggpht.com/-GpgcjavaYnQ/TqZ94XODbVI/AAAAAAAA2Tk/ASuCwocRBSs/s900/2011-10-22%252520-%25252002%252520-%252520Alpenglow%252520on%252520Whitney.jpg\"><br>\r\r\n<i>Mt Whitney from 9,400\' on the North Ridge of Lone Pine Peak.

Sheer granite walls dropped down a ways on both sides of the crest as the crest itself became 5th class in climbing with many gendarmes and exposed knife edges. Fortunately it was easy to keep the scrambling in the cl. 3-4 range by traversing a series of narrow ledges, mostly on the north side of the ridge crest. <br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\n<img src=\"http://lh3.ggpht.com/-nr0yhwMhoFo/TqZ99Mbw6dI/AAAAAAAA2UE/MRFugnr0mJI/s640/2011-10-22%252520-%25252009%252520-%252520Scrambling%252520on%252520the%252520lower%252520CNRoLPP.jpg\"><br>\r\r\n<i>Typical scrambling on the lower N Ridge.

From there we’d either wander onto a ledge system on the south side or traverse out on another ledge on the north side.

We had to traverse down into a chute and wasted time climbing back up to the notch as it turned out that way was impassable. So we had to drop down about 100’, round a corner and then lose another 100’ or so as we traversed across some of the chutes before heading back up. <br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\nAs we neared the ridge we ended up out on a tapering ledge. Here Stefan chose to drop down about 50 ft or so and then climb back up to the ridge crest. To maintain a more direct line, I attempted to continue on the ledge as it tapered out into slab climbing but quickly found myself in 5th class terrain.

He didn’t quite realize how much climbing was still ahead, so pointed out how much we still had left to do despite the summit being much closer by this time.<br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\nWe agreed on a half hour lunch break. So I ate, relaxed, and took some photos.<br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\n<img src=\"http://lh5.ggpht.com/-RhQF4iSeW98/TqZ-EYdJ5OI/AAAAAAAA2Uw/AMuXuVXy6Hc/s640/2011-10-22%252520-%25252017%252520-%252520Mt%252520Whitney%252520%252526%252520needles%252520from%252520the%252520lower%252520CNRoLPP.jpg\"><br>\r\r\n<i>Mt Whitney from about 10,100\' on the N Ridge.</i><br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\n<img src=\"http://lh6.ggpht.com/-ElqbjR7vx0A/TqZ-HYXyy1I/AAAAAAAA2VE/q562LeX_Elo/s640/2011-10-22%252520-%25252022%252520-%252520Russell%252520%252526%252520Carillon%252520%252526%252520Cleaver%252520Pk.jpg\"><br>\r\r\n<i>Mt Russell (left), Carillon Pk (center) &amp; Cleaver Pk (right) from about 10,800 ft on the N Ridge.</i><br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\n<img src=\"http://lh3.ggpht.com/-EBwgsMAzESc/TqZ-I909z3I/AAAAAAAA2VQ/K5mD0LxnSYo/s640/2011-10-22%252520-%25252025%252520-%252520Mt%252520Irvine.jpg\"><br>\r\r\n<i>Mt Irvine &amp; its sweet N Buttress (5.9ish I think)</i><br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\nAfter lunch I rushed up the slopes, which turned into some cl. 3 slabs and ledges near the top.

It would be easy in climbing shoes, but in boots I was glad to have a rope.

So through the Slot I went to bypass the Second Tower, and then I down climbed steep flakes behind. There were a lot of ways to go here, and it wasn’t obvious where the easiest line went. I down climbed about 80 ft and set up a belay as I ran out of rope.<br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\n<img src=\"http://lh6.ggpht.com/-v0sP06R5R8k/TqZ-O89EGtI/AAAAAAAA2V4/J_mZ_ORLDkw/s640/2011-10-22%252520-%25252034%252520-%252520Steep%2525204th%252520class%252520downclimb.jpg\"><br>\r\r\n<i>The 4th class downclimb behind the sharp flake while passing the first tower.

The snow made the terrain tricky enough that we belayed the next pitch or so. If the rock were dry so that we could don rock shoes, we would have been fine soloing or simuling this section to the Third Tower. <br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\n<img src=\"http://lh3.ggpht.com/-1VUBsXVOIFc/TqZ-RRobvPI/AAAAAAAA2WI/_UtfEsK__lk/s640/2011-10-22%252520-%25252038%252520-%252520Looking%252520back%252520on%252520NRoLPP.jpg\"><br>\r\r\n<i>Looking back towards the 2nd tower on the N Ridge.</i><br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\nFinally the rock became more secure &amp; bare and we started simul-climbing, but quickly reached the impasse of the Third Tower.<br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\n<img src=\"http://lh3.ggpht.com/-ZT2XrD2lgzc/TqZ-R9TFKZI/AAAAAAAA2WM/PbqXxzeDrNE/s640/2011-10-22%252520-%25252039%252520-%252520Third%252520Tower.jpg\"><br>\r\r\n<i>The third tower that we thought was the 2nd tower (two different route descriptions number this differently)</i><br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\nWe climbed up to the notch and traversed on a ledge to the west. The route descriptions all sounded like there was some sort of 5.7 lieback, maybe a 5.7 OW (that some parties never found), but all parties mentioned passing 1 or two ring pitons after ascending a corner some 50’ to the west of the notch.<br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\n<img src=\"http://lh4.ggpht.com/-qbxvMJvOVVQ/TqZ-S3xGyUI/AAAAAAAA2WU/sRAV4JqGDp8/s640/2011-10-22%252520-%25252041%252520-%2525205_7%252520Lieback%252520maybe%252520of%2525203rd%252520Tower.jpg\"><br>\r\r\n<i>Is this the 5.7 lieback?</i><br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\nThe first corner looked way too steep &amp; thin, and Stefan couldn’t see any pitons.<br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\n<img src=\"http://lh6.ggpht.com/-085akGEnuQs/TqZ-TqdN3wI/AAAAAAAA2WY/V6PIMLQeTs0/s640/2011-10-22%252520-%25252042%252520-%252520Stefan%252520leading%252520our%252520route%252520up%2525203rd%252520Tower.jpg\"><br>\r\r\n<i>Not any of the 5.7 variations to the third tower described in the guidebooks or SP.

Still no pitons . . .<br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\n<img src=\"http://lh6.ggpht.com/-EgFrLccGkqA/TqZ-UMlXUqI/AAAAAAAA2Wc/OlvmKphGDPU/s640/2011-10-22%252520-%25252043%252520-%2525205_5%252520my%252520butt%252520on%2525203rd%252520Tower.jpg\"><br>\r\r\n<i>This next bit was a bit roofy. Felt to me like 5.6-5.7 even in rock shoes. Then it got dark and it was even harder to tell where we were going.</i><br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\nThe next corner was my lead. Here the route continued up steeply in a corner, with a small roof to surmount (5.6 or 5.7). Rope drag wore me down after the roof so I stopped a little short, perhaps halfway up the Third Tower, and belayed Stefan up to me as the sun set.<br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\n<u><b>Hour 13 (6:30 pm, ca. 12,400’) - Darkness</b></u><br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\nAs the sun set, Stefan and I discussed our predicament. We still had a long ways to go to get to the summit and we were having trouble route finding even in the daylight. However, it was supposed to get well below freezing that night and we had nothing more than light gloves and a puffy jacket each, so bivvying would be VERY cold. Climbing would keep us warmer, so we decided to take our chances with getting lost in the dark, and kept going.<br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\nStefan led out heading right from the ledge, and up another corner and eventually on to some sort of outside corner. I swung leads, continuing up the corner, then into a chute until rope drag stopped me somewhere just shy of the top. Stefan led off again, over the top of the Third Tower and along the ridge, at which point we simul-climbed until we reached the final headwall, perhaps over about 4 pitches’ worth of climbing.<br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\nOur route description stated there was 6-8 pitches of 4th and easy 5th class climbing directly to the summit register, so we expected to be past the crux of the climb by this point, and perhaps on terrain that we could quickly simul to the summit. These hopes were dashed as we reached the base of the headwall only to see a formidably steep &amp; blank wall rising above, with massive routes overhead. Stefan tried traversing a bit to the right, where things quickly became very exposed and the going did not look feasible. There was a crack and what looked like lower angle terrain to the left, so we committed and chose that way.<br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\nWe scrambled down left, wallowed through unconsolidated snow. Keep in mind that we were wearing rock shoes at this point, so this was VERY cold! Stefan led up the thin finger crack and disappeared around the corner. After what seemed like a very long time in the darkness, he pulled up slack and I followed. The crack felt pretty hard since by that time my hands &amp; feet were numb from the snow and my muscles were rigid from the cold. I went around the corner, and then had to downclimb a ways and around the corner. Rope drag had stopped Stefan.<br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\nThe rest of the night was a bit of a blur, although it seemed to never end. Each pitch seemed to be the same as the last: climb up an awkward chimney or OW, usually with sketchy or non-existent pro, often scraping out snow to find holds inside or pro placements. Reach the top, traverse around to avoid roofs, get cliffed out, downclimb until you have nearly reached your old altitude, and then around a corner and  traverse to the base of the next chimney/OW, at which point rope drag becomes unmanageable and you have to stop. Make sure to climb through and stand in plenty of snow during this so that your fingers burn and your feet stay semi-numbed. Repeat ad infinitum. <br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\nI have no idea where our line went that night. All I know is that we were somewhere to the left of the crest, and the climbing seemed harder than easy 5th! Most of the wide pitches seemed harder than our crux pitches on the Third Tower. Rope drag kept pitches to about half a rope length, and between the wind, taught rope &amp; being around corners, we could not communicate with each other, which cost us a lot of time. On several occasions I couldn’t tell when I had hauled up slack to Stefan or if the rope caught up. I got in the habit of throwing together a Z-C system off the anchor with klemheist knots tied from climbing slings to haul through the rope drag.<br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\nAlthough climbing may have kept us somewhat warmer than finding a nice hole in the rock to bivy in, I’m not sure exactly how much warmer we were, as I was very cold climbing through the snow with my thin gloves and climbing shoes, and standing in the snow at belays in the wind, usually half-hanging.<br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\n<u><b>Hour 26 (7:12 am, 12,900’) - Sunrise</b></u> <br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\nTime flies when you\'re having fun. Somehow we still hadn\'t gotten much done.<br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\nAt long last the earliest morning glow was starting to light things, and we were surprised to see where we were. The terrain dropped off steeply on all sides, and even in daylight we couldn’t see where to go. We also had no idea where we were on the face. I stemmed up another corner, humped up over a ledge, and was blocked by another wall &amp; roof. I managed to thread through a gap further west and finally ended up in a large alcove of cl. 3 blocks beneath - another large roof! I saw a cut in the roof and figured we should be able to break through around the corner in that. Rope drag stopped me about 100 ft short of the top.<br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\n<img src=\"http://lh3.ggpht.com/-xGHCKyAIpAQ/TqZ-U5KlDDI/AAAAAAAA2Wg/MHQL9Uo6-2Y/s640/2011-10-23%252520-%25252001%252520-%252520Looking%252520down%252520on%252520NRoLPP%252520at%252520sunrise.jpg\"><br>\r\r\n<i>Sunrise 100 ft short of the summit.</i><br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\nAt least the terrain was easier, it was getting lighter &amp; warmer, and I was sure that the top was finally the top! Stefan climbed up to &amp; past me and was soon on the summit, basking in the morning alpenglow.<br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\n<img src=\"http://lh6.ggpht.com/-4t0_lH-Lzu8/TqZ-V8ugk_I/AAAAAAAA2Wo/KAO3TBBP9oA/s640/2011-10-23%252520-%25252002a%252520-%252520Whitney%252520in%252520alpenglow%252520from%252520LPP%252520summit.jpg\"><br>\r\r\n<i>Sunrise 100\' short of the summit.

I\'d like to traverse this someday. I\'ve traversed the two right summits (Le Conte &amp; Corcoran). This is between Tuttle Creek &amp; Meyson Lake.</i><br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\nAt last! We were on the summit. The way down should be easy, mindless walking and we’d be back at the car before we knew it. Stefan and I were both exhausted from the long, cold night and were feeling the effects of our water &amp; calorie deficits. We nibbled the last of our food and relaxed in the sun until we stopped shivering and our pant legs dried out.<br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\nSo we started plodding down the sand &amp; scree from the summit, relieved that our epic was nearly over and now all we had was a class 2-3 descent down the Northwest Slope and then a straightforward hike out.<br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\n<u><b>Hour 27.5 - Descent</b></u><br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\nOur bad . . .<br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\n<img src=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-0h88xz04mVc/T31kHGOr9GI/AAAAAAABAyg/-OCuHKS9Fvo/s640/Lone%2520Pine%2520Pk%2520Descent.jpg\"><br>\r\r\n<i>An overview of where I spent the next 10 hours</i><br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\nSo in our defense, the Northwest Slope is one of those lines that is easy to follow when ascending, but is trick to find from above if you’ve never been up it. Also, some of my info called it class 2 TO 3, so we were willing to accept a little bit of class 3 downclimbing. The sucker chute just before the correct chute looks reasonable and only cliffs out about 100-200 ft before the end, after you have down climbed about 900 ft of cl. 2-3 terrain. The route info also indicates that you take a turn down a chute at the low point in the ridge linking LPP to the Sierra crest, just before the ridge starts rising again.<br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\nSo we made good time plodding down the climber’s trail. As we neared the low point in the ridge, the trail traversed off to the right as it descended. Just before a patch of snow and a small rise on the right, the trail made a hard right turn towards a small notch formed by this rise. We noted that the trail was a bit more feint here, and the terrain dropped off more steeply than expected. We walked back up and didn’t see the climbers trail heading anywhere else, so we figured the steps weren’t preserved as well lower down, and after looking closer found a reasonably class 3 (but exposed) downclimb into the chutes, which appeared to descend all the way to the lakes below.<br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\n<img src=\"http://lh5.ggpht.com/-Ue0c0sTiYD0/TqZ-ZU19pXI/AAAAAAAA2W8/u3hUFz5OyLY/s640/2011-10-23%252520-%25252007%252520-%252520Whitney%252520Massif.jpg\"><br>\r\r\n<i>The Mt Whitney massif. Mt Muir is the left-most Pk and is counted as a separate 14er, yet none of the other +14000\' spires on the ridge are. Hmmm . . . </i><br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\nThere was a lot of snow on these shaded northern aspects, so we treaded lightly and tried to find the driest chute to descend, so at first we traversed skier\'s left. Downclimbing the mixed snow, scree &amp; slab was precarious at times, but we lost elevation fast and were nearly at the lakes when the terrain dropped away below us!<br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\nStefan and I were really dragging by this time, so we climbed slowly back up the chute to try to find another way down. We found another chute, capped with another cliff at the bottom. I started traversing on a ledge system over to the next chute, hoping that maybe it was more reasonable. Stefan, however, kept traversing along the edge of the cliff. <br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\n“I’m going to keep climbing down this way. It looks like it might go,” Stefan said.<br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\nI still didn’t like the look of it, and knowing that it was definitely off-route, I was not up for soloing down unknown 5th class terrain.<br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\n“Stefan, I don’t know about forcing our way down that line. I’m going to take a look around this corner first. Don’t go too far away”, I replied. I spent maybe 15-20 minutes rounding the corner, doing some very insecure downclimbing on powder snow covered rocks until I got cliffed out again. This cliff, however, looked like it could be rappelled with one rope and then was clear the rest of the way down.<br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\nI headed back over to where I last saw Stefan. He wasn’t there. I shouted for him and there was no response. I ventured right up to the edge of the cliff and shouted down. There was no sign of him. It appeared to me that Stefan had continued down - with the rope.<br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\n<u><b>Hours 30 to 35 - Alone</b></u><br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\nThe uncertainty of completely leaving the area where I had last seen Stefan, and the extremely unpleasant prospect of climbing all the way back up to the plateau to start over again led me to go slightly insane: I started doing the same thing over and over again hoping for a different result. I would re-read the printouts of the route descent descriptions, trying to make sense of where we had gone wrong. Everything seemed to match, and yet not. I climbed back up a ways, traversed over, and climbed down another chute, only to be cliffed out. I did this several times, climbing up and down several hundred feet of mixed rock &amp; snow for each attempt.<br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\n<img src=\"http://lh6.ggpht.com/-1fEBZ-cnuGY/TqZ-YCfLNgI/AAAAAAAA2W0/zGAqEhT46zE/s640/2011-10-23%252520-%25252005%252520-%252520Irvine%252520Pk.jpg\"><br>\r\r\n<i>The nice N Buttress of Mt Irvine (5.9ish I think)</i><br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\nI was feeling so tired I wanted to sleep. I was so thirsty that I started sucking on snow to help alleviate my cottonmouth. I was feeling mindless in the way I normally do when I’ve bonked. And the sun was getting awfully far to the west in the sky. Had I really spend most of the day here? <br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\nI REALLY wanted to get out of here. I knew that I would likely have phone reception here, and I knew of some people who had done the descent, so I swallowed my pride and called out for a “Lifeline” for some hints.<br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\nIt turned out that I didn’t have the cell numbers of most of the people who I knew had been on the route. I did know one person, my friend Dirk, so I gave him a ring. After an awkward greeting and explaining that I was lost and exhausted on the side of the mountain with darkness approaching, Dirk gave me the comforting beta from his descent experience after climbing the NRoLPP:<br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\n“We ended up getting cliffed out in a maze of chutes. Since it was late in the day we had to bivy and rappel out the next day.”<br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\nDoh!<br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\nDirk offered to get me the numbers for Whitney Portal and the Lone Pine ranger station since it was likely someone there knew the route. While I waited for the call back, I continued looking for a way out.<br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\nThings suddenly started seeming promising as I was finding a good ledge system that was cutting across all of the chutes that I had explored earlier. I was wrapping around a corner and could see what looked like possibly a lower angle scree chute to the west. Below me the chutes cliffed out and I started finding rappel anchors. If only I had the rope! I started encountering small sections of 5th class, but fortunately the rock was dry. Since the chute looked close, I figured it was worth pressing into this terrain. <br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\n<img src=\"http://lh3.ggpht.com/-prjpdNOPFC4/TqZ-aJz8RMI/AAAAAAAA2XA/JYcrDVhZkhA/s640/2011-10-23%252520-%25252008%252520-%252520Sketchy%252520Rapp%252520Anchor.jpg\"><br>\r\r\n<i>Not a rapp anchor I\'d use! A little sketchy. I like how they wedged some stones in the crack to help keep the nut in place. I was having trouble finding my way down by this time.</i><br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\nSame as before, I was cliffed out on all sides and had to reverse all of my work. In this daze of exploration I saw a large, brightly colored lump in the cliffs. Could this be a hallucination? Or did someone leave a climbing pack up there? I scrambled up through some 4th class to claim my prize - a gigantic popped squid balloon. Not quite what I was wanting, but being a good steward, I filled up about half of my pack with it to pack out. (Later on when I unfolded it, I think it was actually a flower . .. maybe?)<br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\nBy this time Dirk had given me the numbers. I had already grudgingly called Whitney Portal, and the number turned out to be for some sort of hostel. I held out.<br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\n<u><b>Hour 35-37 - Escape</b></u>  <br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\nFinally, as the sun was nearing the horizon,  I called the ranger station.<br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\n“This is the Inyo County Lone Pine ranger station,” a woman replied.<br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\n“Excuse me, but I’m having a hard time finding my way down the standard route on Lone Pine Peak. I’m getting pretty tired here and would really like to figure out where I’ve gone wrong with my descent before it gets dark. Would there happen to be anyone in the station familiar with the route?” I inquired.<br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\n“Hahaha, no! Heheheh -” CLICK.<br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\nGRRRRRRR!!!<br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\nI hung up on the ranger. That’s it! At last I had finally given up on these stupid chutes and spent the next half hour or so climbing all the way back up to the plateau.  Sure enough, we had taken the worn trail down, which made a sharp turn at the snow patch. There were no prints in the snow so I walked back up the trail a ways, slowly, looking for any sign of a branching trail. There was none, so I walked down, looking carefully again. Still nothing.<br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\nOnce I reached the snow patch I looked beyond it. I thought I saw a faint footprint there, so I headed roughly on that line to the left of the little highpoint to see what was over there. At first the slope dropped away the same as before, but as I approached the dropoff I saw that it rounded into a short little headwall and then a straightforward class 2 chute the rest of the way down!<br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\nI booked it down the chute and was quenching my thirst at the lakes just before sunset.<br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\n<u><b>Hours 37-39 (8:30 pm) - Meyson Lakes Trailhead</b></u><br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\nI moved as fast as I could to find the trail. A misadventure through a muddy bog left me wet from the knees down, and I had a little bit of class 3 scrambling through some ledges to find the trail, but soon I was on easy street. I hiked out as fast as my rebuilt ACL would allow, hoping to maximize my trail distance before darkness slowed me down.<br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\nI called Stefan’s number and left a message telling him my time, location, and ETA. Soon after he called back to report that he had picked up the car via the bike shuttle and was waiting at the trailhead. Apparently he had found a 5.6 chimney that he had downclimbed to get out hours earlier. Well, at least he got the extra work of biking back to the car :-P<br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\nMy time estimate was a bit off, and as it got dark I began to hallucinate (by this criteria this climb was rated amongst the top 4 most exhausting climbs I have ever done). I saw lights moving ahead of me on the trail, and at times they appeared to be moving towards me, and at times away. Was I catching up on someone? Were they on switchbacks below me? I couldn’t tell. Every now and then I swore that I could hear the faint sound of music echoing through the trees and sometimes, a light below. I’m pretty sure based on the topo map that there were no cabins in the Meyson Lakes fork out of Whitney Portal, so I think I badly needed my Orange Fanta soda and dinner.<br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\nSo I enjoyed the entertainment as I huffed it back to the luxuries of shoeless lounging and a long awaited meal. Maybe next year I\'ll look back on this experience more fondly and try the longer NERoLPP?<br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\n<img src=\"http://lh5.ggpht.com/-IR-drak7cHw/T3i5_rxyTuI/AAAAAAABAVI/bNe8E1vA4XM/s640/2011-11-04%252520-%252520Balloon%252520at%252520%252520New%252520Home.JPG\"><br>\r\r\n<i>The balloon in its new home.</i><br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\n<u><b>Notes</b></u><br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\nBelow the notch of the standard route, the route is mostly class 2-3, with occasional class 4-5 bits that could potentially be bypassed with more tortuous wandering. Nice bivy spots abound on the lower ridge, but if you plan to do this route in a day, make sure to move fast or start extra early. You really can do most of the lower ridge in the dark with little concern for routefinding in the dark as long as you’re willing to charge up 4th to low 5th class on occasionally gritty rock.<br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\nI had climbed the East Face of Mt Whitney car-to-car the month before and the technical climbing on this climb was MUCH harder. It really is a solid 5.7, or Whitney’s East Face is more like 5.6, or our route was just plain bad :-P<br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\nThere are a few easy things to consider to make sure you take the right descent:<br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\n1. If you have to scramble down ANYTHING 3rd class, you are descending too soon.<br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\n2. If you are gaining elevation again as you traverse the summit plateau, you have gone too far.<br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\n3. If you can mostly scree ski the route and it isn\'t even close to class 3, then you are taking the right chute.<br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\nHaving these 3 points spelled out for me would have saved many hours of exploring all of the chutes NOT to take down! Pt. #2 was apparent to me, but 1 &amp; 3 would have saved a lot of grief.<br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\n<u><b>Links</b></u><br>\r\r\n<a href=\"https://picasaweb.google.com/105894936663116565516/20111022to23CNRoLPPV57?authuser=0&amp;feat=directlink\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Full photo album on Picasa</a>\r\n</div> \r\n'),(11,'t11479n','/tr/NE-Butt-of-Higher-Cathedral/t11479n.html','NE Butt of Higher Cathedral','content: <div class=\"articletext\">\r\n<div class=\"photonormal\">\r\n<table valign=\"top\" border=\"0\" width=\"395\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" class=\"sdw_box\">\r\n			<tr>\r\n			  <td><img src=\"/nav_img/top_left_sdw.gif\" width=\"13\" height=\"13\"></td>\r\n			  <td class=\"sdw_top\"></td>\r\n			  <td><img src=\"/nav_img/top_right_sdw.gif\" width=\"13\" height=\"13\"></td>\r\n			</tr>\r\n			<tr>\r\n			  <td class=\"sdw_left\"></td>\r\n			  <td class=\"sdw_body\" width=\"369\"><div>\r\n<a href=\"javascript:photoZoom(\'Mz84PTw7KSMg\')\" title=\"Click to enlarge\"><img src=\"http://www.supertopo.com/photos/12/81/249589_2795_L.jpg\" width=\"369\" height=\"600\" name=\"\" alt=\"Higher Cathedral Rock and Cathedral Spires.

Yummy! About 170\' of squeeze chimneying, interrupted by a tricky step-over, before the next hanging belay.</i><br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\nThe next pitch started as a low angle flare. Pretty easy, actually. Mostly fist jamming &amp; stemming while ratcheting up the inside foot jam and resetting your #3 Camalot as you go.<br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\nNear the step across the crack gets thin &amp; steep, and the face gets real slick, so it definitely gets more intimidating! Climbing up to the stepover you need to change sides into an undercling, then finger jam, swing the feet over, then reach FAR right while hanging on the jams. Or you can cheat and yard off the unnecessarily long and very fresh clip tat attached to the piton beyond the crux. I kept it clean :-P<br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\n<img src=\"http://lh4.ggpht.com/-Y_Eh5PQ2JcQ/T7nV5MNK2XI/AAAAAAABGXs/WE23PBmWjow/s600/2012-05-19%252520-%25252020%252520-%252520P7%252520Looking%252520down%252520from%252520step%252520across.jpg\"> <br>\r\r\n<i>Looking down P7 after the tricky 5.9 step across. I am at what would be a much nicer belay than the one I left, as the stance is a bit better and then you\'d start fresh for the route crux just above.</i><br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\nI reached the belay just in time to see the follower ahead pull through the crux. I was tempted to stop here to get back on the original plan, but decided it would be faster to just keep going.<br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\n<img src=\"http://lh5.ggpht.com/-pZ63tT05H7s/T7nV5jkpfZI/AAAAAAABGnc/A9VMaLoAWcI/s600/2012-05-19%252520-%25252021%252520-%252520P7%252520OW%252520Crux.jpg\"> <br>\r\r\n<i>P7 5.9 bombay squeeze. For many the crux of the route. If your butt is fat like mine, you won\'t fit through the top.</i><br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\nThe crux doesn\'t look too bad. It climbs easily enough - until you reach the end. It pinches down in a funny way and I just could not fit through the top. In fact my helmet was getting stuck! You have to do an awkward half exit to finish (by half I mean I still mostly used the crack for an occasional arm bar and torqued leg jam to make the final moves up). The steepness and exposure here definitely made the move out intimidating.<br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\n<img src=\"http://lh5.ggpht.com/-GotlYOpHXTc/T7nV6DWXF5I/AAAAAAABGX0/h8f3DVsO15w/s600/2012-05-19%252520-%25252022%252520-%252520P7%252520Looking%252520down%252520OW%252520Crux.jpg\"> <br>\r\r\n<i>Looking down the P7 5.9 bombay squeeze. For most this is the route crux. I couldn\'t fit through the exit so I had to climb outside of the slot to finish. Burly!</i><br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\nAfter the crux was a 5.8 flare. It didn\'t look too bad, but the outside flare was pretty wide and the crack tapered as you climbed higher, so it was not conducive to any froggying. The rock was really slick, but had just enough face features to stem with while doing the shoulder-roll groove to slither up to the belay.<br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\n<img src=\"http://lh4.ggpht.com/-DLbtBI6ThBM/T7nV6t28qdI/AAAAAAABGX4/WD6Jesy7Q18/s600/2012-05-19%252520-%25252023%252520-%2525205_8%252520Flare%252520on%252520P7.jpg\"> <br>\r\r\n<i>P7 final 5.8 flare. This ended up being harder than it looked. I belayed in the blocks as per SuperTopo. I think it would have been better to either belay where the photo was taken, or (if using the alternate P6 belay) belay just beyond the blocks &amp; 5.9 stem.</i><br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\nThe chockstone was not as nice as it looked from below, and I was tempted to stem up another body length over the next roof as it looked like the angle kicked back. However, I was out of slings to clip the pitons above, the next part looked pretty hard and likely the \"5.9 stem\" indicated as on the next pitch, and I barely had enough gear to make a belay. <br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\n<i>The belay sucks, BTW, as I ended up half squatting on a chockstone beneath a hanging corner and the chockstone made it difficult to get Jon onto the anchor and swap gear. Plus the 5.9 stem was pretty burly for me and I was doing it right above his head. I\'d suggest either setting up a belay just before the 5.8 flare where you can sort of stand in the groove, or if you belayed after the step across, you should have enough rope &amp; gear to climb through the 5.9 stem,a after which is a nice area to belay on.</i><br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\n<img src=\"http://lh6.ggpht.com/-IYPVvWSJ7nY/T7nV7a8TCGI/AAAAAAABGX8/lRr4zPQgPH4/s600/2012-05-19%252520-%25252024%252520-%252520Long%252520Dark%252520Corner%252520of%252520P7.jpg\"> <br>\r\r\n<i>Looking down P7 (5.9).</i><br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\n<img src=\"http://lh6.ggpht.com/-nVd5WuTr0KE/T7nV9B_E12I/AAAAAAABGYA/kbOQ46bXezI/s600/2012-05-19%252520-%25252025-%252520Jon%252520Arriving%252520at%252520P7%252520Belay.jpg\"> <br>\r\r\n<i>Jon finishing up the P7 5.8 flare.</i><br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\nI was getting pretty thirsty, but decided to hold off on water until I finished the next pitch with the traverse.<br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\n<img src=\"http://lh3.ggpht.com/-LAHxdOr6aFQ/T7nV-CNlzwI/AAAAAAABGYE/T-5gbPdsz0w/s600/2012-05-19%252520-%25252026%252520-%252520Cathedral%252520Spires%252520from%252520P7%252520Belay.jpg\"> <br>\r\r\n<i>Cathedral Spires from the P7 belay.</i><br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\nI couldn\'t really see how to do the next part, except for the first couple of moves. I launched off anyways and soon found myself doing some wide stems, twists and jams as I did some burly acrobatics to get over the bulge and step right to a lower angle ledge and the base of the next chimney.<br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\n<img src=\"http://lh3.ggpht.com/-porPMJpkGBg/T7nV_F0N8KI/AAAAAAABGYI/Oqlhc0VC0Qc/s600/2012-05-19%252520-%25252027%252520-%252520P8.jpg\"> <br>\r\r\n<i>P8 (Just after the 5.9 stem starting crux). Ahead is the 5.8 chimney. I linked this pitch with the P9 traverse.</i><br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\nThe next chimney was pretty straightforward. I had brought kneepads for the route but had neglected to put them on. It turns out most of the chimneying really didn\'t involve much knee contact with the rock, and more strange hybrid stemming, chicken-winging, leg-jamming contortions, so I didn\'t miss the pads.<br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\n<img src=\"http://lh3.ggpht.com/-A4DTD3bv2qQ/T7nV_sB3EAI/AAAAAAABGYM/CNMXggC_0A8/s600/2012-05-19%252520-%25252028%252520-%252520P9%252520Traverse.jpg\"><br>\r\r\n<i>P9 traverse.

This was pretty awkward to downclimb, so I left pro for Jon.</i><br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\nI don\'t know why but I had envisioned the P9 ledge being larger. It was really exposed and a bit awkward to downclimb, but no harder than 5.4 or 5.5, with the second step being more awkward.<br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\nWhen Jon reached me I asked for water as I was really craving it by now. Unfortunately he had drunk the last of it! It wasn\'t a broiling day, for sure, but it was still plenty hot. Mouth parched, I set off on the next pitch with renewed motivation to finish the climb so that I could get back to our water cache at the base of the route.<br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\n<img src=\"http://lh5.ggpht.com/-d4dL-XuKgtc/T7nWBV-ydwI/AAAAAAABGYU/rQ24XFIXUjk/s600/2012-05-19%252520-%25252030%252520-%252520Looking%252520Up%252520P10.jpg\"> <br>\r\r\n<i>Starting up P10 (5.8). This pitch starts with some tree wresting, then lots of clean rock &amp; some trick stems &amp; mantels. Overall it went fast and felt like a nice break from the pitches below.</i><br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\nThe OW on P11 was quite memorable. I was very happy to have a #4 &amp; #5 Camalot to reset as I went, especially at the crux. I have a narrow knee but big thighs &amp; calves, so I couldn\'t get my leg in the crack where it narrowed before widening again. A hand stack took care of that conundrum, though Jon was able to get his leg in just fine and scooted along with an arm bar. <br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\nThe 5.9 roof wasn\'t too bad, although it required some steep stemming on very slick granite, and the hand jams were good enough to move on but would not hold if you lost your feet (They were about a red Camalot size). Jon actually slipped here and fell onto the rope as his hands came out - the only fall on the route.<br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\nI was a little too eager to get away from the hated gear sling, so I had packed it away on P10. For P11 I racked on my left side for the right-side-in OW, which was problematic on the second OW/squeeze that was left-side in. After a sad attempt at climbing it without re-racking gear off of my left side, I downclimbed to set up for it properly.<br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\n<img src=\"http://lh6.ggpht.com/-PUX4DqeBGr4/T7nWC-MFj2I/AAAAAAABGYY/oOZKil-8k10/s600/2012-05-19%252520-%25252031%252520-%252520Final%252520OW%252520on%252520P11.jpg\"> <br>\r\r\n<i>P11 final squeeze (5.8+?). P11 was a burly surprise waiting at the end, rivaling P7 as the crux pitch with a 5.8+ OW, slick 5.9 roof stem, and then this. I had already used my wide pro on the first OW, so had to run this out to the blocks above.</i><br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\nAfter the last wide surprise I climbed through some easy blocks to the top, and let out a joyous whoop. At least I intended to, but my mouth was so parched it came out more like a croak. It was time to get down to that warm beer waiting in the El Cap bear boxes!<br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\n<img src=\"http://lh6.ggpht.com/-cRg_Xvx7rWs/T7nWD_ZpadI/AAAAAAABGYc/Uuj4BkGdrP4/s600/2012-05-19%252520-%25252032%252520-%252520Summit%252520View%252520of%252520Valley.jpg\"> <br>\r\r\n<i>View from atop Higher Cathedral Rock.</i><br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\nThis was a spectacular route. The line is elegant, the position is excellent, with the Spires providing constant company on the climb, and the exposure and steepness is unrelenting. Pitch after pitch, the climbing stayed pretty sustained and the rock very clean and well protected. Oddly, this climb struck me as more like an alpine climb than many other Valley climbs, as much of the climbing involved stemming and manteling rather than repetitious jams or liebacks. I\'ll definitely be back to do this gem again!<br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\n<a href=\"http://www.markpthomas.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"http://lh6.ggpht.com/-yfgE9CrENaM/T7nWEJG0jsI/AAAAAAABGYg/ESQEUwHFiOU/s600/2012-05-19%252520-%25252033%252520-%252520Higher%252520Cathedral%252520Spire%252520on%252520Descent.jpg\"> </a><br>\r\r\n<i>Higher Cathedral Spire seen on the descent.</i><br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\n<b>Rack:</b> <br>\r\r\nWe brought 2 sets of cams from 0.4\"-3\", a couple of C3 Camalots, and 1 #4 &amp; 1 #5 Camalot. 1 set of nuts were also helpful here &amp; there.  As I recall, the #5 wasn\'t really useful until P11, so you can leave that boat anchor on the follower for most of the climb. <br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\nFor slings we brought 10 singles &amp; 2 doubles and extended them a fair amount due to the deep placements and many bulges &amp; traverse. A gear sling is a good idea for the chimneys. An extra sling or two would also be helpful for coiling the rope to the side on the constricted hanging belays.\r\n</div> \r\n'),(12,'t11481n','/tr/Central-Pillar-of-Frenzy-warmup-to-East-Buttress-of-Middle-Cathedral-Photo-TR/t11481n.html','Central Pillar of Frenzy warmup to East Buttress of Middle Cathedral - Photo TR','content: <div class=\"articletext\">\r\nTwo classic Valley climbs that I did in combination last year that I figured were good for a photo TR.<br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\n<div class=\"photonormal\">\r\n<table valign=\"top\" border=\"0\" width=\"410\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" class=\"sdw_box\">\r\n			<tr>\r\n			  <td><img src=\"/nav_img/top_left_sdw.gif\" width=\"13\" height=\"13\"></td>\r\n			  <td class=\"sdw_top\"></td>\r\n			  <td><img src=\"/nav_img/top_right_sdw.gif\" width=\"13\" height=\"13\"></td>\r\n			</tr>\r\n			<tr>\r\n			  <td class=\"sdw_left\"></td>\r\n			  <td class=\"sdw_body\" width=\"384\"><div>\r\n<a href=\"javascript:photoZoom(\'Mz84OD03KCEr\')\" title=\"Click to enlarge\"><img src=\"http://www.supertopo.com/photos/12/82/249726_29541_L.jpg\" width=\"384\" height=\"512\" name=\"\" alt=\"Jared enjoying the wide crack on P3 of Central Pillar of Frenzy.\"></a><span class=\"small\"><br>Jared enjoying the wide crack on P3 of Central Pillar of Frenzy.<br><div class=\"photo-credit\">Credit: PellucidWombat</div></span>\r\n</div></td>\r\n			  <td class=\"sdw_right\"></td>\r\n			</tr>\r\n			<tr>\r\n			  <td><img src=\"/nav_img/bottom_left_sdw.gif\" width=\"13\" height=\"13\"></td>\r\n			  <td class=\"sdw_bottom\"></td>\r\n			  <td><img src=\"/nav_img/bottom_right_sdw.gif\" width=\"13\" height=\"13\"></td>\r\n			</tr>\r\n		  </table>\r\n</div>\r\n<br>\r\r\nIn late 2010 I was still new to leading trad. I had set a number of goals for myself to help give me motivation and direction for developing my abilities as a climber, and one of those goals was to climb the East Buttress of Middle Cathedral Rock. How does one know when they are appropriately ready for such a long climb?<br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\nI usually go about goals in a meticulous and organized way, and in climbing I try to balance being conservative while pushing myself to improve. Since the East Buttress is a popular climb, and a long climb, I didn\'t just want to hop on it as soon as I could start leading 5.9s, as I wanted to be solid at the grade and be able to lead 5.7-5.8 quickly and without too much effort. So I asked people who had done the route what sort of less committing routes I should do as a progression to and benchmark for knowing when I was ready to tackle the route. Several climbers suggested that when I felt I was ready to go for the route, I should first climb Central Pillar of Frenzy. They said if I could handle that without much problem, and do it in less than half a day, that I should be ready.<br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\nAlthough I had hoped to do these routes with a partner who I could swing leads with, by the Fall of 2011 I had no such luck for these routes. However, by this time I felt strong &amp; confident enough to lead all of the pitches on both routes, and I did have a partner who, while new to trad, had been doing very well following me up some Yosemite cracks and flaring chimneys earlier in the year.<br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\n<div class=\"horizontalrule\"><hr></div>\r\n<br>\r\r\n<u><b>Central Pillar of Frenzy (III, 5.9, 5P)</b></u><br>\r\r\n<b>September 24, 2011</b><br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\n<div class=\"photonormal\">\r\n<table valign=\"top\" border=\"0\" width=\"427\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" class=\"sdw_box\">\r\n			<tr>\r\n			  <td><img src=\"/nav_img/top_left_sdw.gif\" width=\"13\" height=\"13\"></td>\r\n			  <td class=\"sdw_top\"></td>\r\n			  <td><img src=\"/nav_img/top_right_sdw.gif\" width=\"13\" height=\"13\"></td>\r\n			</tr>\r\n			<tr>\r\n			  <td class=\"sdw_left\"></td>\r\n			  <td class=\"sdw_body\" width=\"401\"><div>\r\n<a href=\"javascript:photoZoom(\'Mz84PTc9JCUi\')\" title=\"Click to enlarge\"><img src=\"http://www.supertopo.com/photos/12/81/249607_18643_L.jpg\" width=\"401\" height=\"600\" name=\"\" alt=\"Central Pillar of Frenzy seen from El Cap Meadow.

As advertised, the 5.9 roof crux is short, but awkward and burly, requiring some funny stemming as you torqued yourself over the lip while yanking on solid finger jams. Fortunately there is a solid piton right at the crux.<br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\nAs I was pretty intimidated by the climbing here, I placed a cam right after the piton just before I pulled the roof. While this made the crux move essentially protected on TR, this was a bad idea, as it held the rope closer to the split corner in the roof. It just so happens that my 70m double ropes are the perfect diameter to stick in cracks of finger jam width, so as soon as I got a few moves higher, the rope stuck. Rather than downclimbing to deal with the problem, I climbed against the worsening drag.<br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\n<a href=\"https://picasaweb.google.com/105894936663116565516/20110925EButtOfMiddleCathedralIV59A011P#5662284857030920914\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"http://lh6.ggpht.com/-Pn-FaOdfGgU/TpR6E9BmytI/AAAAAAAA3Fs/URA_bjOc3IY/s640/2011-09-25%252520-%25252014%252520-%252520Looking%252520down%252520P5.jpg\"></a><br>\r\r\n<i>Looking down P5. Easy 5.6 cracks here made harder by the terrible rope drag as my lines caught in the roof. Doh!</i><br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\nThat turned out to be a bad idea as not only was the last part of the pitch very hard with the rope drag, but it forced me to stop at the standard belay rather than linking pitches. It also took a lot of time to pull in the slack and belaying was much slower until Jared cleared the roof. Since the next belay ledge was small &amp; awkward, it was also difficult to coil the ropes with care while fighting the drag and we had to recoil the rope at the belay once Jared finished following. And so the time cost from my error continued to snowball . . .<br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\n<a href=\"https://picasaweb.google.com/105894936663116565516/20110925EButtOfMiddleCathedralIV59A011P#5662284872881436306\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"http://lh6.ggpht.com/-oMNasN6OCkc/TpR6F4EqdpI/AAAAAAAA3F0/qfp-ffFh9wI/s640/2011-09-25%252520-%25252016%252520-%252520Original%252520chimney%252520route.jpg\"></a><br>\r\r\n<i>Looking up from P5 belay.

Since their belay was slightly ahead of ours, they got onto P6 just as we were ready, so we had to wait for them to pass before continuing on.<br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\n<a href=\"https://picasaweb.google.com/105894936663116565516/20110925EButtOfMiddleCathedralIV59A011P#5662284888644185154\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"http://lh6.ggpht.com/-LYjRoYcXpJ4/TpR6Gyyy7EI/AAAAAAAA3F8/RmAmDK8OcZg/s640/2011-09-25%252520-%25252018%252520-%252520Runout%252520P6.jpg\"></a><br>\r\r\n<i>The runout slab on P6. Now where is that piton?</i><br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\nI saw a nice flake directly above the belay with a piton in it and then what looked like a way to traverse right. SuperTopo emphasized not going straight up, though, so I traversed out directly right from the belay, looking for the first piton.<br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\nYikes!<br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\nI never found the piton, but after a long traverse right from the anchor with no pro, I did eventually reach the belay atop the \"50 Crowded\" variation. <i>(Note: Seeing how you can do this traverse, I think next time I climb this route I\'ll try the \"50 Crowded\" variation and then traverse left to finish on the original chimney variation)</i>.  I placed a piece of pro just above that before climbing up, then traversed far left and then up to the only piton I found on the pitch. Then I traversed far right again. Using doubles really helped in keeping this from being a rope drag nightmare.<br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\nDespite our attempt to recoil the rope, it had been kinked badly enough that we lost time on this pitch as several times Jared had to ask me to stop while he worked out a cluster in the rope.<br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\n<a href=\"https://picasaweb.google.com/105894936663116565516/20110925EButtOfMiddleCathedralIV59A011P#5662284905029646658\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"http://lh4.ggpht.com/-_2xsFjh0vvY/TpR6Hv1ZOUI/AAAAAAAA3GA/9IOUIuo9_f0/s640/2011-09-25%252520-%25252019%252520-%252520Climber%252520on%252520P7.jpg\"></a><br>\r\r\n<i>Climbers on P6-P7.</i><br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\nI coiled the rope better on this pitch, although Jared still had to stop me a few times to work out clusters.

I felt something pop &amp; crumple underneath my obliques. <br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\nAs best as I could tell, I had popped something in my Psoa, as it only hurt to bend down on my left side, or lean into a high-step on my left side, and I would get sympathetic soreness in my lower back.

Japhy was fully on board for climbing the classic Direct Southeast Face of Clyde Minaret (IV, 5.9+, 12P), so before I knew it, I had a car rented, time off from work confirmed, and was hurtling across Tioga pass on a bright, moonlit Friday night to meet him in Mammoth.<br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\n<a href=\"https://picasaweb.google.com/105894936663116565516/20120602to04SEFaceOfClydeMinaretWJaphyD#5751351006027892994\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"http://lh5.ggpht.com/-mtb6fb049Gw/T9DnRJzgyQI/AAAAAAABH6U/23hBbQaBm64/s912/2012-06-02%252520-%25252003%252520-%252520Minarets%252520Far%252520-%252520annotated.jpg\"></a><br>\r\r\n<i>The Minarets.

Downclimbing, we made it to the snow just as it got dark. The temperature plummeted and the wind picked up, but we stayed nice and comfy in the puffies that we had painstaking hauled up the route. A full moon added to the nice ambiance as we picked our way around Ken Minaret and scrambled up to the wrong descent notch (doh!).<br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\nA brief look at the map showed we were close and a bit more scrambling took us to a reasonable notch with a rappel anchor, an old fixed line and very loose rock at the top.

We could take a trail that cut the switchback in the road. And who knows? Maybe we could bum a ride? Even if we got in trouble being on the road, we had not entered from that side, so we figured at most we\'d be shooed into the forest or allowed to walk out since we had technically not reached the road unlawfully.<br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\nWe enjoyed the clear, sunny morning, but by the time we left camp the winds had picked up and clouds had gathered around the Minarets.

As the truck approached us, Japhy, ever the sweet talker, waved to the trucker, and got us a ride out! As we drove up the road, we could see that the steep, loose hillside and the vast number of huge trees blown over would have made it an epic hiking out on our intended trail. Just as we were let off at the Minaret summit, the rain started pouring and quickly changed to a mixture of rain and hail. Talk about perfect timing! We definitely would have gotten caught in that weather had we not gotten that ride, but instead, we were enjoying beer &amp; burgers in Mammoth as we watched the deluge, and then caught refuge for the evening at the Mammoth hot springs.<br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\n<a href=\"https://picasaweb.google.com/105894936663116565516/20120602to04SEFaceOfClydeMinaretWJaphyD#5750948366469540898\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"http://lh4.ggpht.com/-x1CQOMMWBZE/T895EckHrCI/AAAAAAABH3E/70LbexHIYQQ/s912/2012-06-04%252520-%25252020a%252520-%252520Storming%252520clouds%252520from%252520the%252520hot%252520springs%252520Banner.jpg\"></a><br>\r\r\n<i>Stormy clouds over the Sierra, seen from the hot springs.</i> <br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\n<a href=\"https://picasaweb.google.com/105894936663116565516/20120602to04SEFaceOfClydeMinaretWJaphyD#5750948403878219938\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"http://lh4.ggpht.com/-kr-VeXBsMT0/T895Gn7C0KI/AAAAAAABH3M/0JbIBfvwyQo/s800/2012-06-05%252520-%25252001a%252520-%252520Laurel%252520Mtn%252520from%252520the%252520hot%252520springs.jpg\"></a><br>\r\r\n<i>Laurel Mtn NE Gully (III, 5.2)</i> <br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\n<a href=\"https://picasaweb.google.com/105894936663116565516/20120602to04SEFaceOfClydeMinaretWJaphyD#5750948408086115426\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"http://lh5.ggpht.com/-RCuAIqgs45Q/T895G3mSNGI/AAAAAAABH3Q/SmSA06on36Y/s800/2012-06-05%252520-%25252002%252520-%252520Sawtooth%252520Range%252520from%252520Bridgeport.jpg\"></a><br>\r\r\n<i>Sawtooth Range under a fresh dumping of snow. All of the passes had closed due to the storm, so I had to drive home via Tahoe.</i><br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\n<u><b>Route Thoughts &amp; Notes (from a Wombat)</b></u><br>\r\r\n<b>Rack:</b><br>\r\r\nFor a rack we brought 1 set of nuts and a few tricams, one set of of BD Camalots to #3, 1/2 set of Metolius (alternate sizes to the equivalent of a #2 Camalot), and a full set of C3 Camalots. We only placed nuts for the anchor to save cams, and even there we mostly used pink, red and black tricams instead. We found having extras in small cams including the narrower and smaller C3s down do a #0 to be very helpful, especially for the first two pitches. If you are solid on 5.8 leading and climbing with a 60m rope, you could get by with closer to a single set of cams, since our rack worked well for 70m pitches.<br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\nAccording to Roper &amp; Steck\'s \"50 Classic Climbs of North America\":<br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\n<div class=\"blogQuote\">Although the climb is usually done clean, it is advisable to carry five pitons in addition to a standard selection of twenty chocks</div>\r\n<br>\r\r\nThis is no longer advisable. ;-)<br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\n<b>Descent:</b><br>\r\r\nFrom the summit, unrope and scramble north. About 200 ft later you will encounter a steep step (cl. 4). This is the crux of the Rock Route (IMHO one of the best cl. 4 scrambles in the Sierra) and here you have two options:<br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\n1. Continue on to downclimb the Rock Route. This is similar in nature and length to the East Face of Middle Palisade, but a bit harder and more exposed, so only do this if you have time and energy for lots of sustained downclimbing!<br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\n2. Turn left and switchback on some exposed but solid ledges to reach a rappel anchor. A single rope rappel trending climber\'s left brings you into a chute. From here cross the chute to a rib and downclimb the ridge about 100 ft to find our pimpin\' rapp station. One more single rope rappel (or possibly some downclimbing) places you into a good chute for downclimbing. Basically, a single 60m rope and some downclimbing should easily get you down. From there, downclimb to Amphitheater Lake and traverse around Ken Minaret to South Notch where one more short rappel places you onto easy snow slopes for the remainder of the walk back to Cecile Lake.<br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\nThe descent takes a while and would not be fun in the dark, especially if you haven\'t done it before, as it is exposed and would be hard to make sense of by headlamp. So make sure you aim to finish the route with at least enough daylight to get through the first two rappels. Otherwise you are in for an epic night descent or a likely summit bivy.<br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\n<b>Bailing:</b><br>\r\r\nThe route has a number of fixed pieces and bail gear everywhere. Nearly every pitch had some rappel setup, so with two ropes you can rappel the route, although be prepared to make some new rapp stations or leave a bit of gear.<br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\n<b>Route Topo:</b><br>\r\r\nI brought copies of three different topos and have this to say:<br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\n1. The topo on Mtn Project was utter junk. We rarely were on anything like that topo.<br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\n2. The topo from Moynier &amp; Fiddler is pretty good, but a little vague and misleading at some critical junctions.<br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\n3. We had no trouble finding our way following the route description on SummitPost and using Peter Croft\'s topo in \"The Good, the Great, and the Awesome\". Bring these along!<br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\n<b>Miscellany:</b><br>\r\r\nFor the most part, all of the pitches were very long and sustained, though there were many rest along the way. We only were able to link some pitches with a minumum of simul-climbing and not too much drag because we climbed with 70m doubles, so we trimmed the route to 10 pitches and could have trimmed it to 9 if I had set up the belay before the 5.8 traverse at a better spot to reduce drag. Be prepared to do the route as 12 pitches if you bring a 60m or a single rope!<br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\nAlso, the route is long and fairly sustained, and some of the moves higher up are arguably as hard as any on the direct start. So if you think you climb hard and fast enough to do the route, you certainly can handle the 5.9+ start and absolutely should do it this way for two of the best pitches on the route! I have heard this route (without the direct start) described as a good 5.8 route for the solid 5.9 leader, and I\'d agree.<br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\nThe route sucks up gear, and nearly all of the moves can be well protected. <br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\nThe face looks butt ugly and dirty in the shade, but in the sun it looks glorious. Apart from the occasional friable rock and some loose bits on the ledges in the middle pitches, the rock was very solid. The route was far cleaner and more solid than any of the aretes Temple Crag, at least!\r\n</div> \r\n'),(15,'t11524n','/tr/North-Buttress-of-Goode-day-hike-Photo-TR/t11524n.html','North Buttress of Goode day-hike (Photo TR)','content: <div class=\"articletext\">\r\n<u><b>June 16, 2012</b></u><br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\n<div class=\"photonormal\">\r\n<table valign=\"top\" border=\"0\" width=\"476\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" class=\"sdw_box\">\r\n			<tr>\r\n			  <td><img src=\"/nav_img/top_left_sdw.gif\" width=\"13\" height=\"13\"></td>\r\n			  <td class=\"sdw_top\"></td>\r\n			  <td><img src=\"/nav_img/top_right_sdw.gif\" width=\"13\" height=\"13\"></td>\r\n			</tr>\r\n			<tr>\r\n			  <td class=\"sdw_left\"></td>\r\n			  <td class=\"sdw_body\" width=\"450\"><div>\r\n<a href=\"javascript:photoZoom(\'Mz47ODg2Jykh\')\" title=\"Click to enlarge\"><img src=\"http://www.supertopo.com/photos/13/17/253200_11781_L.jpg\" width=\"450\" height=\"600\" name=\"\" alt=\"2012-06-16 - Nic starting the P3 lead &amp;#40;5.9 face traverse&amp;#41;.

Then I got to the knifeblade piton and couldn\'t find enough features to use to get to the second corner. I hesitated to unclip the piton, as I was worried about taking a swing into the unknown around the corner, but I wasn\'t sure if I could reach back to unclip it. I climbed up, climbed down, and eventually decided I could backclean. A few delicate smears and I grabbed the edge, reached back and unclipped the piton, then swing back around the corner and onto a narrow ledge.<br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\nIt was good I did the crux this way! I had to climb another 15 ft or so on a narrow ledge and down into the chimmney, where the next piece of pro was - a slung chockstone. If the follower unclips the piton and falls, they would take about a 15-20 ft blind pendulum around the corner and splatter into the 5.9 face climb to the left of the chimney. This face had sparse pro (Nic made good use of the C3 cams), and was only slightly easier than the crux. Nic had to wander all over the face to find pro and find his way through, as the two didn\'t really coincide.

The 5.8 crux can be stemmed and face climbed on the right just fine, and the 5.9 crux can be nicely stemmed while staying deep enough in to place or clean pro. The only OW moves I did this time were camming my legs in the crack as I moved over the top. If you climb the 5.9 as an OW, left-side in tends to be better.

There are many that are far better, although this one was one of the more geologically interesting routes I\'ve done and it is fun enough. I could see it being much better as a ski descent though! It is definitely one of the easiest scrambles in the Sierra in terms of approach to get to some lengthy scrambling and you can knock it off in a few hours RT if you\'re fit for running up slab and scree skiing. The gully probably has one of the highest climbing-to-approach/descent length ratios in the Sierra, so perhaps that accounts for the popularity?\r\n</div> \r\n'),(18,'t11578n','/tr/Matthes-Crest-S-N-Traverse-III-5-7-and-Full-Traverse-IV-5-8-Photo-TR/t11578n.html','Matthes Crest - S-N Traverse (III, 5.7) and Full Traverse (IV, 5.8) (Photo TR)','content: <div class=\"articletext\">\r\nMatthes Crest is pure Type 1 fun and a must-do for anyone climbing in the Sierra.

There was no pro, and the fin was very narrow (about as wide as a chair or less), but there were lots of feature to grab and edge on, and it reclined at a nice 45-50 degree angle. Falling would be serious even with a rope, but you could remain secure, and it was thrilling to be on such a long, narrow spine of rock!

I did the S-N traverse to the summit last year with the standard 5.7 finish and it was a spectacular climb with a lot of fun scrambling &amp; simul-climbing. The northern section turned out to be far better &amp; a more serious challenge.<br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\nThis year with a faster partner we made shorter work of the standard traverse (not including delays from the crowds) and I finished with the awkward, burly &amp; wide 5.8 crack variation. We continued north and completed the northern section just as the sun set. This section is much more technical (we pitched out 7 pitches) with many of the cruxes encountered as downclimbs with runout pro.

As we neared the \'Fin\', I was surprised to find that the next two climbers ahead were my friends Sean Hermany and David Crockett. They also had intentions of doing the full traverse, so it looked like we would have company along that stretch. They were taking a break while a team of Canadians ahead finished belaying through the 5.6 bypass. Since the \'Fin\' was clear and wouldn\'t interrupt that pitch, we ran ahead and passed the Canadians.

In the end we all collected on the ledge beneath the crux pitch. Chris and I ate lunch while one team started up the 5.7. I had intentions of trying out the awkward 5.8 variation. A climber was on the delicate crux when he took a fall, his top piece, a nut, popped, and despite a cam holding a few feet lower, he hit the large ledge. Fortunately only his pride was injured, although his nerves were shaken enough that he was happy for us to trail a line so that he wouldn\'t have to make another lead attempt on that pitch.<br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\nThe 5.8 is burly and awkward, but not too bad and it is an interesting variation.

Now for those who don’t know Steph, when it comes to night photography (well, photography in general), nice route overlays, and well organized and thorough trip reports, she is like me X10. She is the Pacific Northwest version of me . . . or more as I see it, I’m the California version of her. We’ve been influencing each other’s habits of reports and graphics, and she has been a big inspiration for my changes in climbing style (e.g. siting campsites at aesthetic locations rather than just convenient ones, doing night photography in the backcountry, etc.).<br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\nSince Steph is totally hard core about climbing marathons and doing carryovers (she’s a frequent visitor to the Pickets Range for alpine climbs), she was totally on board with my elaborate idea of a linkup+photography-oriented trip.<br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\n<div class=\"photonormal\">\r\n<table valign=\"top\" border=\"0\" width=\"626\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" class=\"sdw_box\">\r\n			<tr>\r\n			  <td><img src=\"/nav_img/top_left_sdw.gif\" width=\"13\" height=\"13\"></td>\r\n			  <td class=\"sdw_top\"></td>\r\n			  <td><img src=\"/nav_img/top_right_sdw.gif\" width=\"13\" height=\"13\"></td>\r\n			</tr>\r\n			<tr>\r\n			  <td class=\"sdw_left\"></td>\r\n			  <td class=\"sdw_body\" width=\"600\"><div>\r\n<a href=\"javascript:photoZoom(\'MzI0ODc7JCYi\')\" title=\"Click to enlarge\"><img src=\"http://www.supertopo.com/photos/14/26/264137_16547_L.jpg\" width=\"600\" height=\"400\" name=\"\" alt=\"Camp on Mt Owen on a carryover of the Valhalla Traverse, Serendipity A...\"></a><span class=\"small\"><br>Camp on Mt Owen on a carryover of the Valhalla Traverse, Serendipity Arete, and North Ridge of the Grand Teton.<br><div class=\"photo-credit\">Credit: PellucidWombat</div></span>\r\n</div></td>\r\n			  <td class=\"sdw_right\"></td>\r\n			</tr>\r\n			<tr>\r\n			  <td><img src=\"/nav_img/bottom_left_sdw.gif\" width=\"13\" height=\"13\"></td>\r\n			  <td class=\"sdw_bottom\"></td>\r\n			  <td><img src=\"/nav_img/bottom_right_sdw.gif\" width=\"13\" height=\"13\"></td>\r\n			</tr>\r\n		  </table>\r\n</div>\r\n<br>\r\r\nBasically, with a carefully situated base camp and some carryovers, in one trip we had hoped to knock off the following climbs:<br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\n1. North Ridge of Middle Teton (II, 5.6)<br>\r\r\n2. Complete Exum Ridge on the Grand Teton (III, 5.7)<br>\r\r\n3. Serendipity Arete on Mt Owen (IV, 5.9)<br>\r\r\n4.

Valhalla Traverse (II, cl. 3-4, steep snow/ice, rockfall/icefall hazard)<br>\r\r\n2. Owen-Grandstand Traverse (II, 5.7, 3-5 rappels)<br>\r\r\n3.

I have never been in such a constantly windy mountain range.<br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\n*There seem to be 4 general difficulty ratings in the Tetons: <br>\r\r\n   1. Not listed (cl. 2-5) <br>\r\r\n   2. cl. 3-4 <br>\r\r\n   3. 5.7 (which can range from 5.6 to 5.8+. It seems everything is rated 5.7, and I\'ve seen it written somewhere that if you are in the Tetons and in terrain harder than \'5.7\', you are off route) <br>\r\r\n   4. The rare 5.10 or harder<br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\n* The ratings are STOUT. This is probably explained by the fact that many of the earliest climbs in the Tetons were put up by hard East Coast climbers like Jack Durrance and Fritz Weissner (think Gunks standards), and later on the Tetons were where many of the Camp 4 climbers of Yosemite\'s Golden Age went during their off-season from the Valley to do some alpine climbing. <br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\nConclusion: The Tetons are a full value alpine range not to be underestimated!<br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\n<div class=\"horizontalrule\"><hr></div>\r\n<u><b>Day 1: Garnet Canyon Approach and the North Ridge of Middle Teton (II, 5.6)</b></u><br>\r\r\n<b><a href=\"http://www.supertopo.com/tripreport/tripreport.php?articleid=11686\" target=\"_blank\">Full Trip Report</a></b><br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\n<a href=\"https://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/Ia9cNcklb82v5SiM-nwfUtMTjNZETYmyPJy0liipFm0?feat=directlink\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/--L6qoMMzU38/UFKdZopvniI/AAAAAAABOjM/vNxDvh5A0HM/s912/2012-08-31%2520-%252004i%2520-%2520Middle%2520Teton%2520from%2520base%2520of%2520Lower%2520Exum%2520Ridge%2520-%2520by%2520Steph%2520Abegg%2520-%2520annotated.jpg\"></a><br>\r\r\n<i>North Ridge of Middle Teton seen from the start of the Lower Exum Ridge</i><br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\nFor our first day, Steph and I lugged our heavy loads for 10 days of fun in the Tetons up the Garnet Canyon trail to establish our base camp at the Lower Saddle. From here we planned to do a multi-day carryover and then move camp to the Teton Glacier Moraine for other climbing before carrying over Mt Teewinot. <br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\nSince Steph had picked up our permits the day before, we got an early start and made it to camp early enough to set up and then do a quick nearby climb: The North Ridge of Middle Teton. Ortenburger called the climb II, 5.6 with 4.5 hrs listed for the climbing time from the Lower Saddle to the summit. We found it to be a pleasant and straightforward climb of just over an hour to the summit, and although we brought along a rope and rack, we never got them out except for one convenient rappel on the descent. The crux notch, which I guess is often wet, was dry for us and the climbing felt like stiff class 4 to very easy 5th. <br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\n<a href=\"https://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/cWDHKMJGxwXbK5mpphcEctMTjNZETYmyPJy0liipFm0?feat=directlink\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-PG41eSTlr90/UFk4FdYsK8I/AAAAAAABS70/PzOe5BknWPI/s640/2012-08-30%2520-%252047b%2520-%2520Downclimbing%2520Pinocchio%2520Pinnacle%2520-%2520Steph.JPG\"></a><br>\r\r\n<i>Downclimbing Pinocchio Pinnacle (by Steph Abegg)</i><br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\nOn our way down we made sure to scramble to the tops of Bonney\'s Pinnacle and Pinocchio Pinnacle (which had more interesting climbing).

Finding our way to the Lower Exum in the dark was tricker than expected and we lost an hour ascending the wrong ledge system (twice!). <br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\nWe found the correct ramp shortly after sunrise and made quick work of the lower pitches, which had a variety of fun chimneys and cracks to climb. The Black Face pitch contained some incredibly steep and intimidating face climbing and was a great pitch! It is one my more memorable 5.7 face leads. A small storm cell drizzled on us just as I finished, but Steph followed up the slick rock as fast as ever. For the final pitch I took the more direct line (5.8?) which had fun, well-protected crack climbing. Just as I topped out another storm cell had drifted over and a deluge of rain and some hail hammered us while Steph strongly finished the last pitch in cold and slippery conditions.<br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\nWe considered bailing down Wall Street, but the weather looked to be clearing again, and none of the clouds were building to any real height (hence no lightning concern), so we decided not to let a little cold and wet weather put a damper on the day. We had both climbed the Upper Exum before, so we simuled the route quickly, only belaying the Friction Pitch and a short section above the V-Pitch.<br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\nWe enjoyed a nice summit, but had realized that the conditions and late start had slowed us enough that we would not be able to tack on the Valhalla Traverse today as we had originally planned. The descent was slowed by wet rock and thick clouds, but we picked our way down to the Lower Saddle without a problem, and had a relaxed evening preparing for the next day.<br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\nOriginally we had planned to do the carryover in 2 days, with Valhalla being done this day. In light of the setback, and concern of unsettled weather, we wisely packed for 3 days of food &amp; fuel in addition to the food for the half-day entrance traverse.<br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\n<div class=\"horizontalrule\"><hr></div>\r\n<u><b>Day 3: The Valhalla Traverse (II, cl. 3-4, steep ice/snow, rockfall &amp; icefall hazard)</b></u> <br>\r\r\n<b>(Carryover Day 1)</b><br>\r\r\n<b><a href=\"http://www.supertopo.com/tr/The-Valhalla-Traverse-II-cl-3-4-falling-rock-ice-hazard-Carryover-Day-1/t11693n.html\" target=\"_blank\">Full Trip Report</a></b><br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\n<a href=\"https://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/y_8AfLk2Wr4raRmNElV-AtMTjNZETYmyPJy0liipFm0?feat=directlink\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-4SYo9avjrDM/UFQUy4UXKCI/AAAAAAABOnc/b10fQD6HAKQ/s912/2012-08-30%2520-%252041%2520-%2520Valhalla%2520Traverse%2520Start%2520-%2520annotate.jpg\"></a><br>\r\r\n<i>Beginning Section of the Valhalla Traverse seen from the North Ridge of Middle Teton</i><br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\nThis day was forecast to have the most unsettled weather, so fortunately we weren\'t climbing anything high or committing!

Fortunately most of the accumulated hail seemed to have gone away, but there was still enough hail-formed snow and wet rock to make things interesting. As we ascended the ledges, we kept attempting to cut directly up and right too early, and on several occasions found ourselves on 5th class terrain, losing precious time (doh!). In the end it appears that the best way to go is to traverse much farther to the left than you would expect, then traverse much farther back to the right than you’d expect - basically, you spend more time traversing than climbing up. <br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\n<a href=\"https://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/_kHW7C_R3uHf2ChAL_AyEtMTjNZETYmyPJy0liipFm0?feat=directlink\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-CZxBDQQNk-g/UFlMnmRlU4I/AAAAAAABTKs/kDBt8ZAVgEs/s640/2012-09-02%2520-%252028a%2520-%2520Starting%2520P1%2520-%2520Steph.JPG\"></a><br>\r\r\n<i>Starting P1 of Serendipity Arete (by Steph Abegg)</i><br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\nBy the time we reached the start of P1, the winds had picked up, and it was evident that we would have some interesting snow cover to deal with. It was COLD! It was sunny in the valley below, but we could tell that we wouldn’t have sunlight for a while as we were on the backside of Mt Owen. Eventually we reached sunlight, but the winds kept us frigid for most of the day. Despite these discomforts, we thoroughly enjoyed the route. It is long and contains interesting routefinding and a variety of climbing, such as runout face climbing, hand traverses, knife edges, jam cracks, and a crux offwidth exit pitch. I freed the offwidth, and Steph followed opting for the 5.7 C1 variation. Neither of us were game for climbing this pitch with our carryover packs, so we hauled them for this pitch.<br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\nWe had hoped to make it to the Grandstand this day, but between lost time on the approach, being slowed down by the wet, cold and windy conditions, and climbing slower with carryover packs, it was getting late in the day. The summit was farther away from the “last” pitch of Serendipity Arete than we had expected, and by the time we reached the summit, the sun was setting. <br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\nFortunately there were plenty of bivy spots beneath the Koven Chimney and Steph made quick work of modifying a platform to fit our First Light tent. Oh well, we were concerned about the recent precipitation anyways, so we figured it would be better to take our time approaching the North Ridge anyways, in hopes that the days of consecutive sunny weather could clear off the snow and ice that we could see present on the northern aspects of the Grand Teton.<br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\n<a href=\"https://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/8LqQNq3hZL0zvatt-P8jcNMTjNZETYmyPJy0liipFm0?feat=directlink\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-aMsbT613UtQ/UFGkVkN-ZuI/AAAAAAABTRs/AV3lbLV_oKQ/s912/2012-09-02%2520-%252099a%2520-%2520Night%2520Camp%2520on%2520Owen.jpg\"></a><br>\r\r\n<i>Owen Camp at night</i><br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\n<div class=\"horizontalrule\"><hr></div>\r\n<u><b>Day 5: Owen-Grandstand Traverse (II, 5.7, 3-5 rappels)</b></u><br>\r\r\n<b>(Carryover Day 3)</b><br>\r\r\n<b><a href=\"http://www.supertopo.com/tr/Owen-Grandstand-Traverse-II-5-7-with-rappels-Carryover-Day-3/t11697n.html\" target=\"_blank\">Full Trip Report</a></b><br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\n<a href=\"https://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/OLqZviplt5Vdz-XpChKrDdMTjNZETYmyPJy0liipFm0?feat=directlink\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-Z4SO4BSit4A/UFbED_fMdpI/AAAAAAABOrw/vRP1lTne2nY/s912/2012-09-03%2520-%252037%2520-%2520Mt%2520Owen%2520%2526%2520Steph%2520-%2520annotated.jpg\"></a><br>\r\r\n<i>Northern Section-Western View of the Grandstand Traverse seen from the Grandstand</i><br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\n<a href=\"https://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/dmnvdgDnWoUtZz_JVei-J9MTjNZETYmyPJy0liipFm0?feat=directlink\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-uvdizS7Qs_A/UFbEFIVaL7I/AAAAAAABOr4/C9T9hqx12EM/s912/2012-09-05%2520-%252039%2520-%2520Owen-Grandstand-NRidge%2520-%2520annotation.jpg\"></a><br>\r\r\n<i>The Grandstand Traverse from the East (Teton Glacier Moraine)</i><br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\n<a href=\"https://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/ItC9pbbq7Xx26Ch9X9D23NMTjNZETYmyPJy0liipFm0?feat=directlink\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-n9HZs_3OCGA/UFGfWXJN-RI/AAAAAAABR-E/VmhbUVBeRqc/s912/2012-09-03%2520-%252001%2520-%2520Grand%2520Teton%2520under%2520morning%2520alpenglow.jpg\"></a><br>\r\r\n<i>Alpenglow on the North Face of the Grand Teton seen from Mt Owen</i><br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\nUp and out early again, we caught a spectacular alpenglow show on the north face of the Grand Teton as we departed from the Owen Camp. We simul-climbed down the 5.4 section of the Koven Route and traversed south on some nice grassy ledges in the warm morning sunlight. After a few downclimbing steps, we reached a notch and tower and opted for the nice rappel station rather than the tough-looking downclimb to reach the notch and the cold, shaded west side of the south ridge.<br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\nThe West Ledges route had a lot of snow left on the ledges, which made for less secure climbing, so we opted for another rappel at an existing station at some point. After more downclimbing of some very loose gulleys, we made it to a large ledge system that took us over to the 3 remaining rappels into the Gunsight Notch. <br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\nThe first two rappels went just fine, but on the third rappel I ended up too far to the east and was unable to swing back towards the notch highpoint as a corner blocked the maneuver. I had a mini-epic here that cost some time and left me on a small gear anchor to back up my precarious stance on a sloping ice ledge in the East Gunsight Couloir, which was solidly filled with hard neve &amp; ice. I directed Steph to flip the rope and she made it to the notch, where she fixed the rope as a directional and I jugged back up the line with my Guide. Another routefinding error that cost us time (doh!).<br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\n<a href=\"https://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/JrUBsQTxa40-MucLOPSPSdMTjNZETYmyPJy0liipFm0?feat=directlink\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-xOnm-aOjgS8/UFlQkRn_PtI/AAAAAAABREA/_kkFmXh0X0c/s640/2012-09-03%2520-%252020b%2520-%2520Leading%2520Notch%2520Pitch%2520-%2520Steph.JPG\"></a><br>\r\r\n<i>Starting the 5.7 pitch out of the Gunsight Notch (by Steph Abegg)</i><br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\nRock in the notch was incredibly loose, but quickly improved as I climbed the 4th class ledges out of the south side. I cut east and found the start to the 5.7 pitch that leads out of the Gunsight Notch on reputedly good rock. This pitch was very steep and the routefinding was tricky (at least for matching 5.7 climbing with protection opportunities), but the climbing was great! An enjoyable bit of real climbing for the day.<br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\nWe traverse a wide grassy ledge on the Grandstand and then picked our way up the remaining 400 ft of scrambling to the top. Some wet slabs lower down and loose rock higher up added some spice. Fortunately even with the dry winter, there was still snow and running water here so we were able to conveniently resupply.<br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\nWe had considered going for the North Ridge this day, but the conditions still had us wary. It was still early in the day, but the traverse had still taken much longer than anticipated and we decided it would be better to have another relaxing day at a superb campsite and save the North Ridge for the next day. Besides, our initial fast schedule had been to allow time to climb the North Face, and from the Grandstand Camp it was apparent that it was no longer in reasonable climbing conditions for us.<br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\nThis was a good choice as the Grandstand Camp was a great place to hang out, and we would need a good rest for the next day’s challenges.<br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\n<a href=\"https://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/reFs7GSEtzXWbWEbNQKGyNMTjNZETYmyPJy0liipFm0?feat=directlink\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-BbsDFaMPi1Y/UFGgyWhLIaI/AAAAAAABRHo/30WhnVaQAJg/s912/2012-09-03%2520-%252064%2520-%2520Mt%2520Owen%2520at%2520sunest%2520alpenglow.jpg\"></a><br>\r\r\n<i>Alpenglow on Mt Owen seen from the Grandstand</i><br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\n<a href=\"https://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/92JkdrA_o3pdWSGwtjkZetMTjNZETYmyPJy0liipFm0?feat=directlink\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-PR-xsCU9Wzs/UFGg4E7fCmI/AAAAAAABRIA/v4z65Ei2x1A/s912/2012-09-03%2520-%252070%2520-%2520Moon%252C%2520Owen%2520%2526%2520Teewinot.JPG\"></a><br>\r\r\n<i>Full moon over Teewinot &amp; Owen seen from the Grandstand</i><br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\n<a href=\"https://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/RYNEjcm2YuFIFgGx-yiSddMTjNZETYmyPJy0liipFm0?feat=directlink\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-93pzcAuPO64/UFGg6YBQMjI/AAAAAAABRIQ/1jjB0OqKQvg/s912/2012-09-03%2520-%252072b%2520-%2520Owen%2520Long%2520Exposure.jpg\"></a><br>\r\r\n<i>Owen at night from the Grandstand</i><br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\n<div class=\"horizontalrule\"><hr></div>\r\n<u><b>Day 6: North Ridge of the Grand Teton (Italian Cracks Variation)(IV, 5.7, 8P)</b></u><br>\r\r\n<b>(Carryover Day 4)</b><br>\r\r\n<b><a href=\"http://www.supertopo.com/tr/North-Ridge-of-the-Grand-Teton-Italian-Cracks-Variation-IV-5-7-Carryover-Day-4/t11702n.html\" target=\"_blank\">Full Trip Report</a></b><br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\n<a href=\"https://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/HNtyCNIbE2zkuaqfvft5gtMTjNZETYmyPJy0liipFm0?feat=directlink\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-lPf7RXLAUBA/UFfjie_wDYI/AAAAAAABOs0/o0x6AL--GKk/s912/2012-09-03%2520-%252002%2520-%2520Grand%2520Teton%2520under%2520morning%2520alpenglow%2520-%2520annotated.jpg\"></a><br>\r\r\n<i>North Ridge of the Grand Teton from Mt Owen.

This terrain looked benign from below as the snow was hidden by the ledges, indicating that even the terrain above that looked fine was probably even worse. It was obvious that it would be foolhardy to press on to climb the classic Chockstone Chimney route, as we had read warnings about climbing the Chockstone Pitch and the Slab Pitch above if conditions were icy and we felt like the odds were pretty good that those pitches were in fact icy.<br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\n<a href=\"https://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/7tcJTlQPx1CeH7sek-T8K9MTjNZETYmyPJy0liipFm0?feat=directlink\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-_d5Gb_HacN8/UFGcnFdHkkI/AAAAAAABSyw/C9it7WzrNWw/s912/2012-09-04%2520-%252009%2520-%2520Steph%2520following%2520easy%2520P2.jpg\"></a><br>\r\r\n<i>The easier pitches on the North Ridge ended up not being so easy anymore . . .</i><br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\nThe prospect of bailing from this high on the Grand and retrieving our camp at Lower Saddle seemed to be about as risky and unpleasant as pressing on with the route, and we figured the Italian Cracks Variation might not be as icy.

The face climbing pitch was problematic as ice was in cracks that I needed for pro, and some ice dribbles blocked the easiest and most direct lines. I found myself traversing far to the right to get away from the main drippage and then made it to the Second Ledge with an additional pitch.<br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\nSteph and I had discussed the prospect of taking the Second Ledge to the Upper Saddle as an options to get the carryover done without completing the route if conditions were bad, since it is only a few hundred feet of low 5th climbing. By the time Steph reached me on the Second Ledge she was shivering badly and thought she was slightly hypothermic. I asked about the early exit option but, being the stalwart partner that she was, she said she saw no reason not to finish the route after getting to where we were. She whipped out her sleeping bag, crawled inside, and started brewing hot water with the stove!<br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\n<a href=\"https://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/QnCtjq03ALs1DC34QtX_29MTjNZETYmyPJy0liipFm0?feat=directlink\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-oXRLQ5XVmxQ/UFGdBQFe0LI/AAAAAAABS0Y/DgEfMRA4y8Q/s912/2012-09-04%2520-%252027%2520-%2520Steph%2520brewing%2520up%2520on%25202nd%2520Ledge.jpg\"></a><br>\r\r\n<i>Steph rewarming on the Second Ledge</i><br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\nFully rewarmed and refreshed, we continued up the last few pitches to the top.

While we were in the area, then maybe we could move camp up the SW Couloir of Teewinot for some spectacular photography opportunities before carrying camp out the final day.<br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\nAlas, conditions on the North Ridge showed us that it would be a bad idea to climb the North Face, and that the route likely wouldn’t come back into condition while we were in the Tetons, if at all this season (take note, the Pendulum Pitches looked to be a major drainage of meltwater-turned-ice). Still, we liked the idea of doing some exploring and seeing some rarely glimpsed aspects of the Grand, and Steph shared my eagerness in camping out unnecessarily on the backside of Teewinot.<br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\nWe had a semi-leisurely start time and traversed along the Black Dike, through Glencoe Col, descending the loose rock to Teepe Col, where we had a nice second breakfast while enjoying the great panoramic views of Middle Teton and Garnet Canyon. This rock, while loose, wasn’t nearly as bad as the Valhalla Traverse, and between the sunshine and lack of wind, we were finally warm enough to strip back down to our shorts and t-shirts for a change.<br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\n<a href=\"https://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/x9T77gjg5FBU7pZkc9a-ftMTjNZETYmyPJy0liipFm0?feat=directlink\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-CHtNPXORIXs/UFRbQlDd1GI/AAAAAAABOqM/HjWLJQM_q_c/s912/2012-08-27%2520-%252002a%2520-%2520Tetons%2520after%2520rain%2520cleared%2520out%2520the%2520smoke%2520-%2520annotated%2520Black%2520Dike%2520Only.jpg\"></a><br>\r\r\n<i>Eastern Portion of the Black Dike Traverse seen from the valley floor.</i><br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\nI stripped down a little too early, though, as we then descended the Teepe Glacier, which required us to finally make use of our crampons and ice axes. The crampons weren’t terribly secure on tennis shoes, and there was a ½”-1” layer of soft snow on top of the ice underneath, which prevented the crampons from digging into the ice properly. I showed Steph where the least secure part of the descent was by falling and self-arresting, giving myself a few cuts and bruises and providing myself with the cold &amp; wet dousing of the day (we had one every single day after our first day, so this seemed a fitting pattern).<br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\nThe descent from Dike Col really sucked, though. It was very steep and the rock was extremely loose. So loose that later on wind knocked rocks loose at the top, which fell the 1,000 feet down the gulley and all the way across the permanent snowfield, crashing into the moraine at the terminus. Still, it was not nearly as bad as the Valhalla Traverse. <br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\nWe picked our way down and managed to avoid getting on any snow by keeping skier’s left and then cutting over into the next chute. At one point we got a little cliffed out, but after lowering our packs down the impasse, found it to be a straightforward class 4 downclimb. What a difference the packs make!<br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\nWe traversed around the Teton Glacier moraine, left our heavy packs at the start of the SW Couloir route, and scrambled to the top of the moraine for some nice views of the northeast side of the Grand. We dropped down to a good river by the tarn lake within the moraine to stock up on water for the night and next day (there was no snow or running water on Teewinot), and spent several hours relaxing on the grass and slabs beneath the incredible East Ridge of the Grand.<br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\n<a href=\"https://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/sY2X5_ceadHVkCpj-CpC-tMTjNZETYmyPJy0liipFm0?feat=directlink\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-bUoFiF_TaU4/UFQjIXqxWPI/AAAAAAABOos/9lnmUjp2GuU/s912/2012-09-04%2520-%252025a%2520-%2520Teewinot%2520from%25202nd%2520Ledge%2520-%2520annotation.jpg\"></a><br>\r\r\n<i>Southwest Couloir of Mount Teewinot seen from the 2nd Ledge on the North Ridge of the Grand Teton</i><br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\nWe returned to our packs and began the unpleasant by reasonably short slog up to the Teewinot Plateau. In keeping with our Teton tradition, we got lost early on in the route, right at the large grassy benches halfway up the southern aspect. The Ortenburger guidebook offers the unhelpful description of the route by being vague, apart from saying that the routefinding is difficult, and it is easy to get into climbing terrain that is above the class 4 route rating. This is accompanied by an aerial photograph of the area that makes the route look obvious, but in fact could not be matched at all with where we were from the distorted perspective of the cliffs above.<br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\nWe ended up traversing on the grassy ledge too far up and right. Eventually we ditched the heavy packs to do a quick recon (and make the steepening, exposed scrambling more reasonable) and saw we were off route. However, we could see the correct line, and with only about 20 minutes of slogging effort wasted, descended, traversed back, and headed up the correct chute. It turns out that in as many words as the guidebook used to vaguely describe the route, it could have just as easily said to turn a hard left, almost backwards, once reaching the ledge, and take the first promising chute that one sees.<br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\nThe chute was straightforward, and a large, imposing boulder passed easily through a cut in the cliffs on the right before traversing left out of the chute and onto the large flat plateau area. We found an excellent campsite, perfectly situated to enjoy the panoramic views of the Tetons for our photography, and settled in for the night.<br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\n<a href=\"https://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/irFPH6FKEDqS7pXj8rosDtMTjNZETYmyPJy0liipFm0?feat=directlink\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-nQstvxYAem4/UFGfMSajUPI/AAAAAAABTCw/AcaPy0iVYV8/s912/2012-09-05%2520-%252073%2520-%2520Long%2520Exposure%2520Stars%2520above%2520Tetons.JPG\"></a><br>\r\r\n<i>Night Skies over the Tetons (by Mark Thomas)</i><br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\n<a href=\"http://farm9.static.flickr.com/8178/7960824496_95cb60c84c_b.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"http://farm9.static.flickr.com/8178/7960824496_95cb60c84c_b.jpg\"></a><br>\r\r\n<i>Nighttime views of Teewinot before the moonrise (by Steph Abegg)</i><br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\n<a href=\"http://farm9.static.flickr.com/8040/7960826268_efb387f895_b.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"http://farm9.static.flickr.com/8040/7960826268_efb387f895_b.jpg\"></a><br>\r\r\n<i>Early morning shot of the Grand Teton just before the sun rose.

The class 4 cruxes required some thought to downclimb securely, but we felt no need to use the rappel stations, even climbing in approach shoes with our large packs. Eventually we hit the very well worn climbers trail and descended the endless switchbacks down to the cars. From there I headed into Jackson Hole for a burger and beer while Steph disappeared (as is her custom), with plans to reunite for one last climb the following morning.<br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\n<div class=\"horizontalrule\"><hr></div>\r\n<u><b>Day 9: Southwest Ridge of Symmetry Spire (II, 5.7)</b></u><br>\r\r\n<b>(Car-to-Car)</b><br>\r\r\n<b><a href=\"http://www.supertopo.com/tr/Southwest-Ridge-of-Symmetry-Spire-II-5-7/t11719n.html\" target=\"_blank\">Full Trip Report</a></b><br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\n<a href=\"https://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/tdC8-ETPBtUPdfkAOwp1k9MTjNZETYmyPJy0liipFm0?feat=directlink\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-ewsCO7pAB2w/UFfoOoJm72I/AAAAAAABOt8/R9ipWpMmFss/s640/2012-09-07%2520-%252010%2520-%2520Symmetry%2520Spire%2520-%2520annotated.jpg\"></a><br>\r\r\n<i>Southwest Ridge of Symmetry Spire seen on the approach</i><br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\nAs a bonus climb, we had talked about climbing the SW Ridge of Symmetry Spire. Steph’s parents had climbed it 30 years ago, and she wanted to climb the route as a bit of a homage to her parents. She had brought along some photographs from the climb in hopes of recreating some of the photographs with her climbing in them. She had even acquired her mother’s pants, pack, and ice axe that were used in the ascent to bring as props!<br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\nI hadn’t realized it until Steph told me at the base of the climb, but this climb had some other potential significance as well. During our Teton climbing, I had led every pitch that was 5.6 and harder. Despite being a stronger climber than me, and far more comfortable soloing, Steph had not quite felt up to any of the 5th class leads, as she has been struggling in regaining her lead head since her <a href=\"http://www.stephabegg.com/home/tripreports/washington/northcascades/vesper\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">climbing accident</a> in 2010 on Vesper Peak, from which her leg is still recovering. Although I offered my support in leading any of the pitches, we agreed that since she missed on out the leading thus far, she should have dibs on leading every pitch on Symmetry Spire. As it turned out, Symmetry Spire would be the first climb where she truly attempted to get back into leading trad, and she succeeded wonderfully!<br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\nThe hike up was very nice, with a good climber’s trail the entire way, although the start of the route is less obvious. We did our usual routine of starting off route before correcting, but soon we were gaining altitude and were rewarded with breathtaking views of the Cathedral Group to the south (Teewinot, Owen, Grand Teton).<br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\n<a href=\"https://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/iCUGr7CwaqGSLifWNQNmENMTjNZETYmyPJy0liipFm0?feat=directlink\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-_IcWbkAs5Ho/UFGhtEAV0sI/AAAAAAABTGE/8j3a5uV5JdM/s912/2012-09-07%2520-%252035%2520-%2520Teewinot%252C%2520Owen%2520%2526%2520the%2520Grand.jpg\"></a><br>\r\r\n<i>Nice views of the Cathedral Group from the Southwest Ridge</i><br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\nWe had a successful day in tracking down most of the photo spots, and after so many days of freezing and windy conditions, we had a relatively straightforward climb in very comfortable conditions. This route is deserving of it’s status as a Teton classic as it has good solid rock, an interesting line with great views, and the ratings are stout.<br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\nTime passed too quickly on the summit and  soon we were heading down the descent gully and back to our cars. I headed back to California while Steph continued on for a solo backpacking trip into Titcomb Basin. Our Teton Grand Slam was a great success, especially considering the tough conditions, and we proved to be a strong and compatible climbing &amp; photography team. Hopefully we can team up again for another big adventure!<br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\n<div class=\"blogQuote\">I also want to extend a big \"Thank You\" to the American Alpine Club. They awarded us a \"Live Your Dream\" grant that helped make this dream climb happen</div>\r\n<br>\r\r\n<u><b>Bonus: Teton Rock</b></u><br>\r\r\nI figured this worked well as a separate section in the general report, rather than interspersed in the later reports. Basically, the Tetons are composed of gneiss and other cool rocks. Naturally, we photographed some of this interesting geology on our climbs.<br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\n(Note: I am not a geologist.

I quickly found a red Subaru Forester, and confirmed her car by spotting her custom Pickets climbing bumper sticker.

We had 10 days worth of food and fuel, combined with overnight gear and climbing gear to lug up to our Lower Saddle Camp. Using my digital luggage scale, my pack clocked in at about 55 lbs with all of my gear and the rack. Steph\'s pack with her gear and rope clocked in at about <i>\"redacted\"</i> lbs! Steph laughed off the problem that while she knows the optimum weight to carry would be 1/3 of her body weight, she could never seem to get the pack below half her weight. Also, her doctor had told her to keep her pack weight under 30 lbs for the summer. So far she has done several large trips and still strives to meet that order :-)<br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\nBy getting an early start we hoped to beat the heat on the climb up Garnet Canyon, and possibly even have enough time to climb the North Ridge of Middle Teton after setting up camp.<br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\n<a href=\"https://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/hcJj1jFQ2YBBZg3O33z-DdMTjNZETYmyPJy0liipFm0?feat=directlink\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-lOni94Kx0Os/UGGEsDc3UFI/AAAAAAABTuw/HIzF8k8zQ7U/s800/Teton%2520Grand%2520Slam%2520-%2520GE%2520-%25201a.jpg\"></a><br>\r\r\n<b><i>Travels for the day</i></b><br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\nWe made short work of the switchbacks, and although we set a moderate pace, our conversation and steady pace made time pass quickly.

Between the wind, lack of sun, and cold water, things got cold fast. As I shivered in the rain and tried to warm my hands, I worried about Steph, as she still had to climb this exposed pitch in the cold, wet conditions. It was sure to be slick as well.

Still, these weren\'t the cumulonimbus clouds that we feared, so I climbed on. I took the 5.7 variation of the last pitch, which contained some fun and fairly consistent 5.7 jam cracks that took me nearly directly up to the Wall Street ledge. No sooner had I reached the ledge than the rain resumed with a lot more intensity than on the prior pitch. I threw together an anchor, slipped on my rain poncho, and took cover with my feet underneath the rope slack I pulled up as the rain picked up in intesity.<br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\n\"Poor Steph!\" I thought, as my hands numbed and I began to take in rope on belay. Now things were very wet and cold, and Steph was more exposed to the weather than I, getting more soaked by the rain and faced with following the pitch under very wet conditions. Still, Steph arrived at the P6 belay all smiles.<br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\n<a href=\"https://picasaweb.google.com/105894936663116565516/20120831TetonsWStephCompleteExumRidgeIII576P#5789726705113681058\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"http://lh5.ggpht.com/-ixl5MEVnUfY/UFk9w1TkzKI/AAAAAAABSrQ/1U9sGP3p5wY/s800/2012-08-31%252520-%25252019a%252520-%252520Belaying%252520Atop%252520P5%252520-%252520Steph.JPG\"></a><br>\r\r\n<b><i>Staying dry belaying atop P6.

Back then I was very nervous about exposure, which ultimately led me to stop trad climbing before I had progressed much. However, beginning in the spring of 2010 I had resumed trad climbing with a vengeance, and so in 2012 it was interesting to revisit this route that had been such a benchmark of climbing for me. Back in 2005 we pitched out much of the route, but now, even in the intermittent rain, the exposure seemed nonexistent, and the rock was still providing relaxed, Type I fun as I jammed, crimped, and stemmed my way up the ridge.<br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\n<a href=\"https://picasaweb.google.com/105894936663116565516/20120831TetonsWStephCompleteExumRidgeIII576P#5787574281776185826\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"http://lh3.ggpht.com/-UtC8NYnei0U/UFGYJTh0weI/AAAAAAABSrY/aEwGv4r_8rY/s800/2012-08-31%252520-%25252021%252520-%252520Cloudy%252520Upper%252520Exum%252520Ridge.JPG\"></a><br>\r\r\n<b><i>Cloudy Upper Exum Ridge.</i></b><br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\nSmall cells of clouds continued to blow over us, but we still made relatively fast work of the route.<br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\n<a href=\"https://picasaweb.google.com/105894936663116565516/20120831TetonsWStephCompleteExumRidgeIII576P#5787574370584490370\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"http://lh6.ggpht.com/-X-_79ksxuh4/UFGYOeXX8YI/AAAAAAABSrs/QJbuEtmHO2I/s800/2012-08-31%252520-%25252025%252520-%252520Simul-climbing%252520the%252520Upper%252520Exum%252520Ridge%252520Wind%252520Tunnel%252520Pitch.JPG\"></a><br>\r\r\n<b><i>Reaching the Wind Tunnel (through the boulders).</i></b><br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\n<a href=\"https://picasaweb.google.com/105894936663116565516/20120831TetonsWStephCompleteExumRidgeIII576P#5787574383751039250\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"http://lh3.ggpht.com/-oORmrAHYSCA/UFGYPPahiRI/AAAAAAABSr0/qVifHQWF1PE/s800/2012-08-31%252520-%25252026%252520-%252520Steph%252520pleading%252520to%252520the%252520mountain%252520rain%252520gods.JPG\"></a><br>\r\r\n<b><i>Steph pleading to the mountain rain gods.</i></b><br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\nI had remembered the Friction Pitch being pretty thin and exposed, and with the intermittent rain, I was concerned about it being wet, so as we neared it, I traversed to a gully on the right where I remembered there being some more technical but more secure and better protected bypass options.<br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\n<a href=\"https://picasaweb.google.com/105894936663116565516/20120831TetonsWStephCompleteExumRidgeIII576P#5787574397769713394\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"http://lh3.ggpht.com/-wkSvTZcbGbQ/UFGYQDo1hvI/AAAAAAABSr4/MthnEfZXH7g/s800/2012-08-31%252520-%25252027%252520-%252520Friction%252520Pitch%252520Bypass.JPG\"></a><br>\r\r\n<b><i>Investigating the Friction Pitch bypass.

Steph and I had hoped to knock this route off quickly enough to pack up camp and do the Valhalla Traverse to finish off the day, but our routefinding error and the bad weather had slowed us down enough that we risked having insufficient daylight for this. We had read that the end of the traverse was a serious undertaking and felt that it would be a bad idea to do in the dark, so as we relaxed on the summit and talked things over, we decided to have an easier day today and forfeit a day of our total trip to do a more leisurely traverse. This would work out well anyways, as the weather the next day was forecast to be the worst of the entire trip.<br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\nWe bundled up and proceeded to pick our way back to the rappels through the eerie mist.

The largest linkup I had dreamed up was to traverse from our base camp at the Lower Saddle over to Valhalla Canyon. There we could gain the Grandstand via the classic Serendipity Arete on Mt. Owen and a traverse from that summit (although one could directly climb the Grandstand from Valhalla Canyon). The Grandstand would serve as our launching point for climbing our main objective of the carryover - the North Ridge of the Grand Teton, from which we could then return to our remaining gear cache at the Lower Saddle.<br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\nThe Valhalla Traverse was the key to us achieving this ambitious linkup as we could make a complete loop from the Lower Saddle without any need to hike back out. It was a wonderful idea, but it was also ambitious. We had originally planned to do the Valhalla Traverse the same day as the Complete Exum Ridge (the guidebook said we only needed 3-4 hrs to do the traverse), then climb Serendipity Arete to the Grandstand in a long day, and then finish climbing over the North Ridge. This would mean we would spend 2.5 days and 2 nights doing the linkup.<br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\nHowever, conditions on the Exum slowed us up enough that we decided not to tempt fate with the Valhalla Traverse that day, so we left an entire day for it, on the worst weather day forecast for our trip. Since I was wary about any additional weather slowing us up, we decided to pack for 4 full days and 3 nights\' worth of food and fuel just in case we were delayed a day. It was good we did this, since the storms on our first day, combined with the cold and windy weather on the days after made us take 4 days to do the linkup instead of 2.5!<br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\nFor the record, it took us about 3 hours to do the traverse from the Lower Saddle to the West Gunsight Couloir. This traverse might be done faster with lighter packs, though it often might be slower as there is normally more snow and ice on the route. The Teton NPS maintains a good <a href=\"http://tetonclimbingroutes.blogspot.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">web blog</a> on route conditions in the area, and they often include conditions on this traverse.<br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\n<a href=\"https://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/WSLC8Cg2aGyRZkUDVkvuzNMTjNZETYmyPJy0liipFm0?feat=directlink\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-bebYlpuZ9mI/UGGFFlb7SYI/AAAAAAABTwg/oRYxh2WsHCU/s800/Teton%2520Grand%2520Slam%2520-%2520GE%2520-%25202-6%2520Carryover-b.jpg\"></a><br>\r\r\n<b><i>The 4-Day Carryover Seen from Above</i></b><br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\n<a href=\"https://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/wPiZJ_xaFl2cywP9hrl_D9MTjNZETYmyPJy0liipFm0?feat=directlink\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-AgQxEF-J9jA/UGGFDQfTztI/AAAAAAABTwY/4ExE6PuFbqs/s800/Teton%2520Grand%2520Slam%2520-%2520GE%2520-%25202-6%2520Carryover-a.jpg\"></a><br>\r\r\n<b><i>The 4-Day Carryover Seen from the West</i></b><br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\n<div class=\"horizontalrule\"><hr></div>\r\n<b><u>The Valhalla Traverse</u></b><br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\n<a href=\"https://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/AELYUtEpPuETI4mXYKEKvtMTjNZETYmyPJy0liipFm0?feat=directlink\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-HCaopl1lEFI/UGGFBRl9R1I/AAAAAAABTwQ/nJ-965ciglE/s800/Teton%2520Grand%2520Slam%2520-%2520GE%2520-%25203.jpg\"></a><br>\r\r\n<b><i>Our path for the Valhalla Traverse, seen from the West</i></b><br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\n<a href=\"https://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/y_8AfLk2Wr4raRmNElV-AtMTjNZETYmyPJy0liipFm0?feat=directlink\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-4SYo9avjrDM/UFQUy4UXKCI/AAAAAAABUuE/AzRelxnrR1w/s800/2012-08-30%2520-%252041%2520-%2520Valhalla%2520Traverse%2520Start%2520-%2520annotate.jpg\"></a><br>\r\r\n<b><i>The beginning of the Valhalla Traverse heading out from the Lower Saddle</i></b><br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\n<div class=\"horizontalrule\"><hr></div>\r\n<b><u>Heading out from Camp</u></b><br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\nSteph and I woke early the next day, with gear packed for the multi-day carryover and the extra food, fuel, and luxuries packed separately to be left at the Lower Saddle as a cache.

However, the ice was hard enough and the position awkward enough that it was difficult to chop steps very efficiently. Steph started looking for a way to climb the steeper rock above to where we could possibly just step over the ice. I expressed my doubts about going that way without being roped up, as it looked to be 4th class on extremely loose rock and we were already in steep terrain where falling would be very bad.<br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\nAs I was expressing my doubts about Steph\'s strategy, a table-sized block of ice came tumbling down the narrow strip of ice! Well, after seeing that I agreed that it would be a bad idea to try the slow process of chopping steps. It also probably wouldn\'t be a good idea to rope up here, as stretching a rope across the debris chute now seemed like a bad idea.<br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\nFortunately Steph found a way up that was reasonably solid if you were careful, and she was able to quickly step across the ice and run across the gully before stopping and waiting beneath the cover of the next set of tiered cliffs. I carefully climbed up and into position, during which time another large block of ice came falling down. Once I was in position, I stopped and listened to make sure nothing was coming down, and quickly stepped across and ran over to Steph as fast as I could.<br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\nThat guidebook certainly put the conditions of this traverse mildly!

Fortunately one of the key pieces of beta that I gleaned was that one should aim for starting the belayed pitches about one pitch below the gigantic corner and roof on the first tower. It was good we had this as a reference, as the annotated aerial photo in the Ortenburger &amp; Jackson guide showed a completely incorrect line!<br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\n<a href=\"https://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/5dlyKFpX6wXRRmM6Jjt3pNMTjNZETYmyPJy0liipFm0?feat=directlink\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-z4ioyBMkqDY/UFgYrvtGjCI/AAAAAAABUuc/ztMFahTOykA/s800/2012-09-01%2520-%252027%2520-%2520Serendipity%2520Arete%2520%2526%2520Approach%2520-%2520annotated.jpg\"></a><br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\nThe approach started out well enough. It seemed that all of the hail that had fallen the day and night before had melted . . . we hoped. The rock and grass was still a tad wet, but it seemed like we would have reasonable conditions. We headed partway up the next gully to the north of our camp, taking a line we had scouted the day before, and traversed out north onto ledges early on.<br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\n<a href=\"https://picasaweb.google.com/105894936663116565516/20120902TetonsWStephSerendipityAreteIV5915P#5787585709436934418\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"http://lh4.ggpht.com/-alg3LrKspaM/UFGiie4dmRI/AAAAAAABTJk/KT1OA6DgjnI/s800/2012-09-02%252520-%25252014%252520-%252520Steph%252520starting%252520up%252520the%252520approach.jpg\"></a><br>\r\r\n<b><i>Steph starting up the approach.</i></b><br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\nThese ledges worked out well enough, but when the first main ledge pinched off into a class 3-4 chimney, I took off on the corner to the right. Based on what we had seen from camp the day before, and looking at the line drawn in the guidebook photo, we figured we stayed mostly to the right of the large corner until we came up to the first roped pitch. This idea dominated our routefinding strategy for the morning and led to us being off route for most of the time approaching the route.<br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\n<a href=\"https://picasaweb.google.com/105894936663116565516/20120902TetonsWStephSerendipityAreteIV5915P#5789742990532307458\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"http://lh5.ggpht.com/-BPRoOaQc7jQ/UFlMkxN8agI/AAAAAAABTJo/QUz4QZ54xNg/s800/2012-09-02%252520-%25252014a%252520-%2525205th%252520class%252520groove%252520on%252520approach%252520-%252520Steph.JPG\"></a><br>\r\r\n<b><i>Climbing off route up a slightly wet 5th class groove.

Steph wasn\'t feeling her wet slab soloing mojo this morning, so I dropped a coil of rope to belay her up past the crux.

Fortunately we got back on better terrain above . . . and then got off route on 5th class again :-P</i></b><br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\nThe easiest line above the corner was to continue traversing north, so we did so, finding a nice class 2 ledge, and saw that apparently the lower ledge opened up after the class 4 chimney and nicely merged with our ledge. Doh! We continued traversing far left, looking for the first reasonable line to cut up towards the next set of ledges. Eventually we found a break and I investigated. Then I roped up to simul climbg (clue), then decided I needed a full on belay (another clue). I climbed through terrain that felt more like 5.6-5.7 to me (yet more clues) until I was stymied by a corner that seemed to burly and insecure to climb with a pack (even more clues). Still, we had the idea in our minds that we needed to be switching back before heading too far north. Steph offered her suggestions on an alternate route, that upon inspection, turned out to be even worse. After 20 minutes or so of wasted time, I came down and we tried the idea of just following the ledge north until a definitively non-5th class way to reach the next ledge above us presented itself.<br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\n<a href=\"https://picasaweb.google.com/105894936663116565516/20120902TetonsWStephSerendipityAreteIV5915P#5787585740706473618\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"http://lh3.ggpht.com/-ErE5uc5G7A0/UFGikTXs5pI/AAAAAAABTJw/wEFkKCIIHVw/s800/2012-09-02%252520-%25252016%252520-%252520The%252520Enclosure%252520Area%252520at%252520Sunrise.jpg\"></a><br>\r\r\n<b><i>Sunrise on the Grand Teton and Enclosure.</i></b><br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\n<a href=\"https://picasaweb.google.com/105894936663116565516/20120902TetonsWStephSerendipityAreteIV5915P#5787585761290167442\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"http://lh3.ggpht.com/-T4hY4s8hFtQ/UFGilgDPJJI/AAAAAAABTJ0/_EjPojCtv2U/s800/2012-09-02%252520-%25252017%252520-%252520N%252520Face%252520%252526%252520Ridge%252520of%252520the%252520Grand%252520at%252520Sunrise.jpg\"></a><br>\r\r\n<b><i>North Face and North Ridge of the Grand Teton at sunrise.</i></b><br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\n<a href=\"https://picasaweb.google.com/105894936663116565516/20120902TetonsWStephSerendipityAreteIV5915P#5787585776687393666\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"http://lh5.ggpht.com/-LkWLLdI1c5k/UFGimZaOK4I/AAAAAAABTJ4/yE1IeE7dqWU/s800/2012-09-02%252520-%25252018%252520-%252520Table%252520Mountain%252520at%252520Sunrise.jpg\"></a><br>\r\r\n<b><i>Table Mountain at sunrise.</i></b><br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\nThis alpine stuff is a lot harder when you can\'t see the terrain due to perspective, and there is virtually no information (or incorrect information) for choosing your line! After wasting so much time on the 5th class groove, and the harder 5th class dead end, we decided to play it safe and just routefind as we went, rather than trying to make our route fit our preconceived notions. This ended up working much better. We traversed much farther north than expected, but found an easy way up to the next ledge. Then we traversed much farther south than expected before finding the next break to the next ledge. Oh well. Although we were traversing much more than we were ascending, at least we were moving much more continuously.<br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\n<a href=\"https://picasaweb.google.com/105894936663116565516/20120902TetonsWStephSerendipityAreteIV5915P#5787585794434552802\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"http://lh5.ggpht.com/-l-t0_uf0Kbk/UFGinbheU-I/AAAAAAABTJ8/160yFEFRYC4/s800/2012-09-02%252520-%25252019%252520-%252520Approaching%252520the%252520route.jpg\"></a><br>\r\r\n<b><i>Still approaching the route, trying to keep the climbing easier.

Some people belay here, but I decided to follow the descriptions that had me ascend the next corner first. I actually found this corner to be the crux of the climb after the 5.9 OW finishing pitch. You must climb a hand crack in the corner, and it is reminiscent of a classic Indian Creek splitter. The problem is that it was a little too tight for me to get my palm in, and the corner flared for the first 5 ft with slick, featureless walls, so basically I had no feet and was starting on what felt like a slight overhang. I threw a red cam in high, shoved my hand in as deep as it would go, crimped to hold it, and kicked my feet against the walls as I pulled up on the jams and dynamically bumped then up a few times until the crack widened enough to get a more solid, passive jam. I threw in another piece, moved a few more tiring moves up, and at last I could get my feet in the crack! From here it was easy jamming and some tricky stemming and awkward squeezing to finish the pitch.<br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\n<a href=\"https://picasaweb.google.com/105894936663116565516/20120902TetonsWStephSerendipityAreteIV5915P#5787586192331490994\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"http://lh3.ggpht.com/-TfE6PgPAdUY/UFGi-lzfxrI/AAAAAAABTLo/yqeqV-5FHcA/s800/2012-09-02%252520-%25252037a%252520-%252520P2%252520crux%252520corner.jpg\"></a><br>\r\r\n<b><i>Turning the corner on P2.

While my pack did make things harder, Steph had the benefit of smaller hands and a top rope and also felt that it was much harder than 5.7.

There were no cracks except for the offwidth, and alas we didn\'t bring our Valley Giants. The face was featured enough to appear reasonable to face climb, staying mostly alongside the offwidth.

It was featureless, and the beginning was a bombay with no feet. I basically hung off a chicken wing and jerked my feet up and kicked against the wall enough to get the momentum to dynamically bump the chickenwing up a few times. Then I could throw my left leg into the crack, torque it, and I was set! Also, by removing the pack that I had been climbing with all day, I felt lighter than air, and although this section was by far the technical crux of the climb, for me it wasn\'t that hard physically. So I inchwormed up half a body length, clipped the piton, inchwormed the rest, then chimneyed up to nice stance. If you are climbing with a light pack, you could just trail it on this pitch and continue higher, but if heavily loaded like we were, I stopped at a convenient point to minimize hauling and make it very easy to toss rope down.<br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\n<a href=\"https://picasaweb.google.com/105894936663116565516/20120902TetonsWStephSerendipityAreteIV5915P#5789743533146968098\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"http://lh6.ggpht.com/-4_A-6TqB1ec/UFlNEWnXECI/AAAAAAABTP4/qdhBO8sPFxs/s800/2012-09-02%252520-%25252082ab%252520-%252520Climbing%252520the%252520OW%252520Crux%252520-%252520Steph.jpg\"></a><br>\r\r\n<b><i>Climbing the OW crux.

Put your follower on belay in guide mode and belay them up to the hauling point. Back up the locked off device with a knot.<br>\r\r\n2. Clip the hauling line through the highest piece in the anchor (assuming it is solid) as a redirect.<br>\r\r\n3. Tie a sling as a prussic knot onto the hauling line, clipped to the highest piece, to act as a ratchet. Also, if the packs are heavy, tie another sling onto the hauling line as a prussic with a long loop to act as a foot pedal (Basically, spectra slings grab onto my double ropes better tied as prussic knots than Klemheist knots.)<br>\r\r\n4. Pump away on the foot pedal while holding open the ratchet prussic. Ideally, the foot pedal is long and has a knot or two tied in it so that you can start high, and move up onto the higher step to maximize the hauling distance in one round.<br>\r\r\n5. Once your body is as low as you can go below the anchor, let the weight transfer to the ratchet prussic and reset the foot pedal.<br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\nI found that I can haul packs faster than my partners could follow, so this seems to work pretty well!<br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\n<a href=\"https://picasaweb.google.com/105894936663116565516/20120902TetonsWStephSerendipityAreteIV5915P#5787587370402607538\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"http://lh4.ggpht.com/-YwzJfzcxrFs/UFGkDKdicbI/AAAAAAABTQA/miUWQYQIbGA/s800/2012-09-02%252520-%25252084%252520-%252520Alpine%252520Pack%252520Hauling.jpg\"></a><br>\r\r\n<b><i>Alpine pack hauling.

I then left it hanging on the ratchet prussic, and had enough slack to toss down a coil and haul my pack using a second ratchet prussic. Steph clipped the loop free to a carbiner on my pack, which gave me a 2:1 hauling advantage on my pack, so I easily hauled it up and over Steph\'s pack until the ice tool on the back caught the next little roof (doh!).

Owen to the Grandstand of the Grand Teton. This section is the routefinding crux of the Cathedral Traverse and one of the technical cruxes (if I recall correctly), so we expected a challenging day finding our way to the Grandstand. We had hoped to combine this traverse with Serendipity Arete the day before, but the long, tiring nature of Serendipity, combined with cold conditions, slowed us up enough that we stopped early.<br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\nSteph and I discussed the possibility of climbing the North Ridge the same day as the traverse, as the traverse should only take a few hours, but we decided that we would most likely take our time and stop early on the Grandstand. We didn\'t want to risk getting partway up the North Ridge and run out of daylight. Also, we could see snow and ice on the ledges of the Grand, and we hoped that another day of clear weather and sunshine would melt it off enough to make the route more reasonable to climb.<br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\nIt took us about 3 hours to climb from the summit area of Mt Owen to the Gunsight, and another 3 hours to gain the top of the Grandstand. Expect faster times if you don\'t get ropes stuck on rappel, travel lighter, and know where you are going.<br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\n<a href=\"https://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/RDNz6F5dEvHeEHwU_o4swNMTjNZETYmyPJy0liipFm0?feat=directlink\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-QP3DXiQZil8/UGGE2qiGW6I/AAAAAAABTvg/ESsGR93J9H8/s800/Teton%2520Grand%2520Slam%2520-%2520GE%2520-%25205.jpg\"></a><br>\r\r\n<b><i>Traversing from Owen to the Grandstand</i></b><br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\n<a href=\"https://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/OLqZviplt5Vdz-XpChKrDdMTjNZETYmyPJy0liipFm0?feat=directlink\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-Z4SO4BSit4A/UFbED_fMdpI/AAAAAAABUwA/1FxDt9KmCUI/s800/2012-09-03%2520-%252037%2520-%2520Mt%2520Owen%2520%2526%2520Steph%2520-%2520annotated.jpg\"></a><br>\r\r\n<b><i>Descending from Mt.

Basically, just keep traversing the big ledge. You downclimb a couple of class 3 steps and then you reach a dramatic dropoff before a large tower. You can\'t miss this. From here it is supposedly a steep and improbable class 4 downclimb into the notch. I say supposedly because there was also a nice and well maintained rappel station here and we chose to take that option. It is a short, single rope rappel to the notch from here.<br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\nThe downclimb appears to be steep and tricky for the first 20 ft before reaching a large slabby ledge about halfway down. From here the rest of the downclimb is easy if you pick the right way off the slab. I know this because our rope got stuck when we pulled it and I climbed back up to free it - the rope had stuck itself wrapped around a rock projecting up on the slabby ledge section.<br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\n<a href=\"https://picasaweb.google.com/105894936663116565516/20120903TetonsWStephOwenToGrandstandII5735Rappels#5789747181100807170\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"http://lh5.ggpht.com/-uHd0LF3Ku7I/UFlQYsTVNAI/AAAAAAABTno/KLM2XhveJoU/s800/2012-09-03%252520-%25252009b%252520-%252520Rapelling%252520before%252520the%252520tower%252520-%252520Steph.JPG\"></a><br>\r\r\n<b><i>Rappelling into the West Ledges route just before the tower.

I swung rappeller\'s left onto better rock to avoid knocking it onto my face. The farther down I went, the more I tried to traverse left, but I was around the corner of this pedestal and the rope limited me in how far back left I could tension. As I dropped down the final steep section, I could see that the ropes didn\'t reach the bottom! I tensioned left even harder and could barely get them to reach. However, the Gunsight had trickier conditions on the East side than I had expected. The entire section east of the notch was filled with very steep ice and snow and a big fall waiting below.<br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\nBy this time I couldn\'t swing over to the Notch and had to rappel down into the chute before figuring out how to solve this predicament.

I tied a backup knot in the end and awkwardly tried to climb up to the notch, yarding on the rope until I reached rock. I tried climbing the rock, which was so junky that halfway up a large hold pulled, sending me back down the couloir onto a back flop and swing into the wall. Aaag! At least I had a backup knot.<br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\nNext strategy was to get to a very small platform just level enough to stand on. I could barely make a two-piece anchor with a #0 C3 and a small nut, so I did this to get off rappel. I then directed Steph to flip the rope so that she could rappel directly down to the notch, which she did piece of cake (doh!). She fixed the rope to a piece in the notch as a directional and to lessen bounce in the rope, and I tried climbing back up the rope. This time I knew not to trust the rock, so I jugged up with my belay device in guide mode, tying more frequent backup knots, stemming on the loose rock and carefully stepping around the large, loose sandy blocks capping the top of the chute.<br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\n<a href=\"https://picasaweb.google.com/105894936663116565516/20120903TetonsWStephOwenToGrandstandII5735Rappels#5789747346605275154\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"http://lh5.ggpht.com/-U07TCVkIgOQ/UFlQiU2q-BI/AAAAAAABTok/G5y1TBYPDP0/s800/2012-09-03%252520-%25252016ca%252520-%252520Jugging%252520back%252520up%252520to%252520Notch%252520-%252520Steph.jpg\"></a><br>\r\r\n<b><i>Jugging up to the Gunsight Notch using my belay device in guide mode while being delicate stemming around the death blocks.

The slabs were wet here and there, which made for some interesting scrambling moments.<br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\n<a href=\"https://picasaweb.google.com/105894936663116565516/20120903TetonsWStephOwenToGrandstandII5735Rappels#5787582898311683410\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"http://lh3.ggpht.com/-v6XdoE-GbXM/UFGf-2n-XVI/AAAAAAABTpY/9RRe9VO3YHU/s800/2012-09-03%252520-%25252027%252520-%252520Steph%252520on%252520cl%2525203%252520terrain%252520on%252520the%252520Grandstand.jpg\"></a><br>\r\r\n<b><i>Steph on cl. 3 terrain on the Grandstand.

Even with the dry winter and the late season, there was still some snow and even running meltwater on this final section, which allowed for convenient water gathering. We set up camp on a spot just barely large enough for the tent, and Steph took off for an hour water gathering outing (note - other parties might want to refill water on their way up, as the running water source for us was about halfway back down where we had come).<br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\n<a href=\"https://picasaweb.google.com/105894936663116565516/20120903TetonsWStephOwenToGrandstandII5735Rappels#5789747397601849410\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"http://lh3.ggpht.com/-XzGGdQ6SVtE/UFlQlS1M8EI/AAAAAAABTp0/Gy_7OMEI0D4/s800/2012-09-03%252520-%25252033a%252520-%252520Me%252520at%252520Grandstand%252520Camp%252520-%252520Steph.JPG\"></a><br>\r\r\n<b><i>At the Grandstand Camp.

I could see icicles hanging on the shaded faces near the alcove where I believed the Chockstone Chimney to be. As the sun heated the face we could occasionally here this ice detach from the rock and crash down the face. Today is definitely a day to relax at the Grandstand! Most of the face looked dry, so we hoped that maybe one more day of melting would make the route reasonable. Still, I worried about the bits of ice that I could see trickled down here and there on some of the face climbing sections . . .<br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\n<a href=\"https://picasaweb.google.com/105894936663116565516/20120903TetonsWStephOwenToGrandstandII5735Rappels#5789747414612648242\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"http://lh4.ggpht.com/-upbKJpHspdo/UFlQmSM5ITI/AAAAAAABTp8/4G2BNxw332c/s800/2012-09-03%252520-%25252034a%252520-%252520Making%252520Topos%252520-%252520Steph.JPG\"></a><br>\r\r\n<b><i>Making topos of our wanderings to pass the time.

At the time of its first ascent, this route was perhaps the most difficult climb in the country. This route, which averages over 63° for 1,200 feet, is better described as the intersection of two high-angle faces than as a ridge; <br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\nEven the climb up to the top of the Grandstand is not trivial. \" - Ortenburger &amp; Jackson, A Climber\'s Guide to the Tetons</div>\r\n<br>\r\r\nInspiring quotes like this one are what have kindled my interest and fascination of climbing the impressive and historic routes of the North Face and North Ridge of the Grand Teton. After gaining the Grandstand the day prior, and looking down the other possible approaches to it, I\'d have to say that one thing that really sets the North Ridge apart is its isolation. One must work quite hard just to get to the start of this great route, and from there one is quite committed to finishing it.<br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\n<div class=\"horizontalrule\"><hr></div>\r\n<b><u>Cold Start and the Lower Pitches</u></b><br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\n<a href=\"https://picasaweb.google.com/105894936663116565516/20120904TetonsWStephNorthRidgeItalianCracksVarIV578P#5787578998339843858\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"http://lh3.ggpht.com/-8DWCy9fCq7Q/UFGcb2GOtxI/AAAAAAABSyM/zrA5FZLONSg/s800/2012-09-04%252520-%25252001%252520-%252520Sunrise%252520over%252520Teewinot.jpg\"></a><br>\r\r\n<b><i>Sunrise over Mt Teewinot.</i></b><br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\nAnother early day in the Tetons.

I\'ve fallen and I can\'t get up!</i></b><br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\nLooking at the topo, pitch 1 had a flake that one must tunnel behind. It is very hard to pick out the flake directly as it blends into the wall, but the day before we figured we had it identified. Since I was worried about tunneling through with a large pack on, I tried a more direct, but probably more difficult line, that avoided the tunnel through. It was more like 5.6-5.7 rather than class 4. I climbed the short face section in the howling wind, then stopped beside the flake to get some feeling back into my hands.

Neither guidebook made similar warnings about other routes. Naturally this left me apprehensive about climbing on. Specifically, the pitch after the chimneys is a 5.7 friction slab that apparently ices up.<br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\nI belayed Steph up and told her my concerns. However, I happened to have brought along a topo and beta for the Italian Cracks Variation. It avoided the chimneys and slab pitch, so I thought maybe it would be doable in these conditions. Also, it was on the sunny and leeward side of the crest, so it would be much more bearable to climb. Steph agreed that this would be a good way to go.<br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\nI also voiced my wondering about us bailing, but Steph pointed out that considering how remote the top of the Grandstand is, the serious nature of reversing from the Grandstand might scarcely be less sketchy than pressing on. Plus then we would have to hike back up Garnet Canyon to retrieve our camp. Up and over the Grand would probably be the easiest and least sketchy way to go from here.

I was on thin, knobby terrain with no pro in sight! Time to relax and watch my balance with my pack. I could see the easiest way through was to head straight up, and there were some cracks there for the first piece of pro, about 20-25\' off the belay.

Eventually the terrain forced me back to the main iced up bottleneck, but at least I was closer to pro, and I could climb into it better from the side than below. All of the best holds had ice on them, so I started grabbing some of the eyebrows of ice and began ripping them off the rock wall. I could get enough off to make a slightly better path through the crux, and as the terrain eased up and more of the rock had ice on it, went all out, ripping ice clear from holds and tossing it behind me to make a path up the face. When I later told Steph about doing this, she said she was getting pelted with ice, but thought it was from pieces naturally detaching from the face as the rock heated up. My bad!<br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\nFinally I started making headway until I reached a long, leaning wide crack. Here the rock steepened became even icier. I was running low on small gear and the crack was too wide for anything else. So I detoured again, climbing along the crack far to the right, and around a corner to a sloping ledge. Since there as a fixed anchor in this slab, I thought it was the slab pitch atop the Classic variation (it later turned out to be the next corner over).

I could tell it would be a straightforwrad 5.6-5.7 chimney if I could face right-side in, but with a pack there was no way I was going to fit that way, so I climbed it facing straight it. I made decent progress with shoulder jams and standing up off of crossed legs, levered off the wall. There was a chockstone inside, but no other pro, and facing straight in I couldn\'t get in deep enough to reach the chockstone. Also, the chimney was lined in flaky, dead lichen.<br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\nI made it halfway up the chimney when the puffy jacket I was wearing tore open, shrinking my shoulder jams enough that I fell back down, shearing off lichen as it ground up the jacket. I took off the puffy to reattempt the chimney in my sturdier and grippier soft shell jacket. I made it about halfway up again and had trouble getting enough leverage with my crossed legs and I slipped down again. So I went up a third time, all out, as falling inside the chimney was a safe, slow-motion oozing anyways.<br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\nThis time I made to the top, but there was no pro in sight. Waiting for me was a sloping slab covered in ice, and it would be very awkward to climb onto it. If I slipped, I would fly off the ledge and take a real fall this time onto the ledge below. Due to the awkwardness of the exit, I decided trailing the pack would be a bad idea as well. Regrettably, I downclimbed and left my pack clipped to my last piece of pro, hoping that I could make a belay atop the next chimney and haul the pack up once Steph reached it.<br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\n<a href=\"https://picasaweb.google.com/105894936663116565516/20120904TetonsWStephNorthRidgeItalianCracksVarIV578P#5787580071585773874\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"http://lh6.ggpht.com/-n6_U8m7mxoQ/UFGdaUP_-TI/AAAAAAABS14/gOwkGqxCDqU/s800/2012-09-04%252520-%25252046%252520-%252520P9%252520icy%252520chimney.jpg\"></a><br>\r\r\n<b><i>Our P10 icy squeeze chimney, lined with lots of loose, sharp, dead lichen.</i></b><br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\nThis time, facing right side in, the chimney was pretty casual apart from the slippery lichen and ice.

Uplift from the wind would cause the hiking pole to fall off of the rock, so the restraints of the compression member were reinforced by post-tensioning the system by telescoping the pole in order to reduce uplift on the compression member.

The traverse is probably a lot more enjoyable in earlier season when there is more snow on it - especially on the final long couloir.<br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\n<a href=\"https://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/SnULSYOW468YJBTDTD_Z3tMTjNZETYmyPJy0liipFm0?feat=directlink\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-rO9DFn7wJZM/UFRbSta6v4I/AAAAAAABUuI/In_yW1WVbqw/s800/2012-08-30%2520-%252044%2520-%2520Grand%2520Teton%2520from%2520Bonneys%2520Pinnacle%2520-%2520annotated.jpg\"></a><br>\r\r\n<b><i>Lower Saddle Area and the first part of the Black Dike Traverse</i></b><br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\n<a href=\"https://picasaweb.google.com/105894936663116565516/20120905TetonsWStephBlackDikeTraverseIICl3SnowTeewinotSWCouloirIICl4#5790088207769156802\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"http://lh5.ggpht.com/-BoYnAgrcTe8/UFqGjDpCPMI/AAAAAAABTDI/ZwqEGzygnVs/s800/2012-09-05%252520-%25252004%252520-%252520Steph%252520starting%252520the%252520Black%252520Dike%252520Traverse%252520-%252520annotated.jpg\"></a><br>\r\r\n<b><i>Starting the Black Dike Traverse.</i></b><br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\n<a href=\"https://picasaweb.google.com/105894936663116565516/20120905TetonsWStephBlackDikeTraverseIICl3SnowTeewinotSWCouloirIICl4#5787580565704813666\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"http://lh4.ggpht.com/-WF1OAvwElv8/UFGd3E_KLGI/AAAAAAABS9w/jUc-ZDMaUxI/s800/2012-09-05%252520-%25252005%252520-%252520Black%252520Dike%252520Traverse.jpg\"></a><br>\r\r\n<b><i>Ascending to Glencoe Col.</i></b><br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\n<a href=\"https://picasaweb.google.com/105894936663116565516/20120905TetonsWStephBlackDikeTraverseIICl3SnowTeewinotSWCouloirIICl4#5787580592091910802\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"http://lh5.ggpht.com/-EQiygWKJ4MA/UFGd4nSVUpI/AAAAAAABS90/lmAJuNwV_zA/s800/2012-09-05%252520-%25252006%252520-%252520Optional%252520lower%252520pitches%252520to%252520the%252520Exum%252520Ridge.jpg\"></a><br>\r\r\n<b><i>Optional lower pitches to the Lower Exum Ridge.</i></b><br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\n<a href=\"https://picasaweb.google.com/105894936663116565516/20120905TetonsWStephBlackDikeTraverseIICl3SnowTeewinotSWCouloirIICl4#5787580641121581410\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"http://lh5.ggpht.com/-5ZO49sbA9Ao/UFGd7d76uWI/AAAAAAABS98/OdmA5BTqho0/s800/2012-09-05%252520-%25252008%252520-%252520Base%252520of%252520Petzold%252520Ridge.jpg\"></a><br>\r\r\n<b><i>Base of Petzoldt Ridge.</i></b><br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\n<a href=\"https://picasaweb.google.com/105894936663116565516/20120905TetonsWStephBlackDikeTraverseIICl3SnowTeewinotSWCouloirIICl4#5787580662941350754\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"http://lh5.ggpht.com/--m9hodM_6mA/UFGd8vOJ-2I/AAAAAAABS-E/KM1XCmwG-s4/s800/2012-09-05%252520-%25252009%252520-%252520First%252520Notch%252520in%252520Black%252520DikeTraverse.jpg\"></a><br>\r\r\n<b><i>Looking up Underhill Ridge.</i></b><br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\n<a href=\"https://picasaweb.google.com/105894936663116565516/20120905TetonsWStephBlackDikeTraverseIICl3SnowTeewinotSWCouloirIICl4#5789755865176312882\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"http://lh3.ggpht.com/-i4KTq5Jrxjs/UFlYSLARjDI/AAAAAAABS-I/kK0s3MRwFXI/s800/2012-09-05%252520-%25252009a%252520-%252520Descending%252520from%252520first%252520notch%252520-%252520Steph.JPG\"></a><br>\r\r\n<b><i>Crossing through Glencoe Col, heading towards Teepe Col.

That slush kept the crampon points from engaging in the ice while creating a nice slippery cushion. So despite the warm sunny weather (for once!)

Scrambling up we hit a knife edge ridge and got cliffed out. Oops! At least by looking back I could see better were we had wandered and where we should probably go. We gathered our packs and with only about 30 min time wasted, were back on route.<br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\nApparently the guidebook should have said \"as soon as you reach the large grassy ledge, turn left immediately, and head up the nearest large chute\". This would have been a much better way to describe the best route. We were able to traverse high into the chute, which appeared to be blocked by a huge chockstone. There was an opening to the right that offered pretty reasonable class 3-4 scrambling, and a short ways higher I saw a good way to traverse out left and onto the western plateau.<br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\n<a href=\"https://picasaweb.google.com/105894936663116565516/20120905TetonsWStephBlackDikeTraverseIICl3SnowTeewinotSWCouloirIICl4#5787581767511243234\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"http://lh6.ggpht.com/-hDOtF-dqP-c/UFGe9CEI-eI/AAAAAAABTBk/Rg01aVtilTg/s800/2012-09-05%252520-%25252056%252520-%252520Course%252520correction.jpg\"></a><br>\r\r\n<b><i>Course correction.

I\'ve climbed a lot of declared \'classics\' the past couple of years in California, and I figured yeah, this would be a nice 5.7-5.8 classic, but probably forgettable rock, views, and moves among the numerous other 5.7ish classics in California. Boy was I wrong! So I\'m giving the route some props. The rock was interesting, the climbing varied in both type and difficulty, and the views were spectacular all around. The quality of the rock was also pretty unreal for a High Sierra trad climb. Nothing loose anywhere! It was almost like being in Tuolumne Meadows.<br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\nHowever, this route is not for the fledgling 5.7-5.8 alpine trad leader. You should have your alpine skills pretty dialed, including routefinding and comfort with runouts. I found the climb overall to be much harder than the Regular Route on Fairview Dome, and much more committing, even though the technical crux was easier on Charlotte. <br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\n<div class=\"photonormal\">\r\n<table valign=\"top\" border=\"0\" width=\"626\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" class=\"sdw_box\">\r\n			<tr>\r\n			  <td><img src=\"/nav_img/top_left_sdw.gif\" width=\"13\" height=\"13\"></td>\r\n			  <td class=\"sdw_top\"></td>\r\n			  <td><img src=\"/nav_img/top_right_sdw.gif\" width=\"13\" height=\"13\"></td>\r\n			</tr>\r\n			<tr>\r\n			  <td class=\"sdw_left\"></td>\r\n			  <td class=\"sdw_body\" width=\"600\"><div>\r\n<a href=\"javascript:photoZoom(\'Ojw8PTYnJiEhJQ,,\')\" title=\"Click to enlarge\"><img src=\"http://www.supertopo.com/photos/14/67/268238_17446_L.jpg\" width=\"600\" height=\"450\" name=\"\" alt=\"South Face of Charlotte Dome route annotation according to SuperTopo.\"></a><span class=\"small\"><br>South Face of Charlotte Dome route annotation according to SuperTopo.<br><div class=\"photo-credit\">Credit: PellucidWombat</div></span>\r\n</div></td>\r\n			  <td class=\"sdw_right\"></td>\r\n			</tr>\r\n			<tr>\r\n			  <td><img src=\"/nav_img/bottom_left_sdw.gif\" width=\"13\" height=\"13\"></td>\r\n			  <td class=\"sdw_bottom\"></td>\r\n			  <td><img src=\"/nav_img/bottom_right_sdw.gif\" width=\"13\" height=\"13\"></td>\r\n			</tr>\r\n		  </table>\r\n</div>\r\n<br>\r\r\n<div class=\"horizontalrule\"><hr></div>\r\n<br>\r\r\n<b>May 27, 2012</b><br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\nAs a last minute Memorial weekend \"Plan B\" climb, Scott Berry and I seized an opportunity to climb together and experience a route that we both had at the top of our lists: The South Face of Charlotte Dome (III, 5.8, 12P). This \"50 Classic Climb\" turned out to be a stellar outing, with pitch after pitch of immaculate rock, varied climbing features and ever increasing exposure. Scott &amp; I managed to extend &amp; link pitches such that we brought it down to 9 LONG pitches. <br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\nWe waited until after the Saturday snow storm had passed before heading up late Saturday night-err Sunday morning? This snow storm did leave the route in rather unique conditions for us as the Furrows were shedding ice all day. This was trivial lower down where the chunks had a chance to shatter into small bits, but closer to the headwall, one was aware of climbing through a firing range! We hurried through that part to get under the cover of the steeper headwall. <br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\nIt turns out my friends Chris Terry &amp; Dominique &amp; their friends also had plans to climb the route, and we ran into them at the base and climbed it as 3 teams of 2. They let us go ahead of them with the idea that we could do the routefinding work. This worked out well, though some of the belay anchors got a little crowded.<br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\n<a href=\"https://picasaweb.google.com/105894936663116565516/20120527to28CharlotteDomeSFaceWScottBerry#5751350912092649554\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"http://lh5.ggpht.com/-bRFVPueO5tY/T9DnLr3muFI/AAAAAAABH6E/siYPQAK7exc/s800/2012-05-27%252520-%25252006%252520-%252520Charlotte%252520Dome%252520on%252520approach%252520slabs%252520-%252520Our%252520Belay%252520annotate.jpg\"></a><br>\r\r\n<i>Charlotte Dome seen from the approach slabs.

I was going into auto-pilot mode as I hadn\'t gotten much sleep that week and was now pushing nearly 39 hours with virtually no sleep since Friday morning (I think my brain decided to clock out at about midnight as I had been expecting to be asleep by then!). <br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\nWe reached a spot where the ridge seemed to cliff out, just about 100\' short of the saddle, and as I was investigating a reasonable way around the impasse, the others decided we were close enough to the gully that maybe we could rappel into it. Normally I would have been very resistant to this idea as I don\'t like to rappel unless it is absolutely necessary (It usually is not the quick and guaranteed escape that many people tend to think it is). But I was so tired, I just followed along. So Scott offers to take the blame for this one while I was mentally AWOL :-P (Actually, Scott only offers 95% responsibility. Some of the others offered various percentages as well for themselves, and naturally my passiveness with the rappel factored in to things. How shall we proportion responsibility among 6 people? . . . eh, let\'s just say it was one big cluster that led to the bivy).<br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\nOne rappel led to another, which led to another, which led to another, which led to another, and then the rope didn\'t reach any more anchors. Hmmm . . .<br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\nWe were at a small, sloping ledge beside a tree, the weather was nice, and we only had a few more hours until sunrise by now anyways, so we decided to bivy and work out how to get down in the morning when we could see better.<br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\nI was nice and comfy sleeping inside my backpack while hanging on a gear anchor and managed to get a good amount of snoozing (I was last down on the rappel and there was not enough space for me by the tree). The others huddled in a pile under a single space blanket beside a tree. Unfortunately they couldn\'t fall asleep while I was able to. Fortunately, I was far enough away that they couldn\'t take out any frustrations on me and my snoring :-) <br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\n<a href=\"https://picasaweb.google.com/105894936663116565516/20120527to28CharlotteDomeSFaceWScottBerry#5752277678586043442\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"http://lh6.ggpht.com/-zFDhxxBg0ds/T9QyEmGHnDI/AAAAAAABIPg/GL2saMw2D-I/s800/2012-05-28%252520-%25252000%252520-%252520Waiting%252520to%252520rappel%252520at%252520the%252520bivy%252520spot%252520-%252520by%252520Scott%252520Berry.jpg\"></a><br>\r\r\n<i>Waiting to rappel from the bivy tree.

During our Teton climbing, I had led every pitch that was 5.6 and harder. Despite being a stronger climber than me, and far more comfortable soloing, Steph had not quite felt up to any of the 5th class leads, as she has been struggling in regaining her lead head since her climbing accident in 2010 on Vesper Peak, from which her leg is still recovering. Although I offered my support in leading any of the pitches, we agreed that since she missed on out the leading thus far, she should have dibs on leading every pitch on Symmetry Spire. I had thought that Steph had done some trad leading this summer, but as it turned out she hadn\'t led anything harder than 4th to low 5th class - Symmetry Spire would be the first climb where she truly attempted to get back into leading trad!<br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\n<a href=\"https://picasaweb.google.com/105894936663116565516/20120907TetonsWStephSWRidgeOfSymmetrySpireII576P#5787584329937702466\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"http://lh3.ggpht.com/-X4ZeHhgTQIA/UFGhSL2NzkI/AAAAAAABTEo/cEpjhF3sDoQ/s800/2012-09-07%252520-%25252015%252520-%252520Steph%252520lacing%252520up%252520to%252520start.jpg\"></a><br>\r\r\n<b><i>Steph lacing up to start.</i></b><br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\nHowever, things went off to a bumpy start.

From my vantage it didn\'t look that bad, and I tried offering some suggestions to Steph on what looked like some good ways to go. She still thought it was too much, and backed off, discouraged. I turned things around, though as when I climbed up to where she had backed off, I found the climbing surprisingly thin, steep, and dirty. No way was this 5.6!

Unfortunately we didn\'t get the weather window needed for the 4-day climb, but in between checking the daily weather updates at the climbing ranger station we escaped the smoke to sample all of the microbrews Jackson Hole had to offer. Near the end of our stay a nighttime rain &amp; lightning storm cleared out the smoke, so we enjoyed a scenic drive and then climbed Irene\'s Arete car-to-car, leaving at a casual 11am and getting back shortly after dark. It was a stellar climb, with surprisingly hard climbing for the grade! The views were incredible and the climbing was varied, sustained, and interesting.

Really not the best time to be heading up to do a climb in the Tetons, but the forecast for the day was all right, and we decided we\'d watch the weather carefully and decide as we go whether to hop on the climb. At the very least we would get in a good hike. (Note: We also thought about continuing up so late in the day on each pitch of the climb. However, at each of the belays we could see that it would be reasonable to quickly rappel down to shelter if the weather deteriorated, and the clouds stayed at bay, so we kept climbing. This route is not very committing.)<br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\nProbably one of the highlights of the day was a rather bizarre encounter on the trail. A drop dead gorgeous gal in her late 20s was hiking up the trail, wearing nothing but very bright, sleek, skimpy workout clothes. She was fit enough that as we caught up we could tell she was hiking much slower than she could, and the light clothes really weren\'t necessary for how hard she was working to hike at that pace. However, she was holding hands love-dovey with a guy maybe 5-10 yrs older, dressed in trashy jeans and a dirty sweatshirt, looking like he belonged on the couch at home with a bag of chips more than on the trail, as he was panting with exhaustion. As we raced by she complimented us on our solid hiking form (Whaat? First time I\'ve ever heard someone say that as I passed), the guy said something in passing along the lines of us being crazy fast (which we weren\'t) and Thomas heard her telling her companion that actually she often hiked as fast with her girlfriends. Thomas and I were amused and confused at the bizarre contrast of the couple. What was going on there?<br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\nAs we neared the Meadows, we realized that even with the beta from MountainProject, Teton Rock Climbs, and A Climber\'s Guide to the Tetons, we still could not identify the arete. The descriptions were somewhat vague, and the aerial photos we had were very difficult to match with the steep perspective of the south wall of Disappointment Pk. We couldn\'t even place ourselves in the photo. <br>\r\r\n <a href=\"https://picasaweb.google.com/105894936663116565516/20120830TetonsWStephGarnetCanyonApproachMiddleTetonII56#5787572576641943106\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"http://lh3.ggpht.com/-ZPwj_XQuGJo/UFGWmDaJBkI/AAAAAAABUJw/d6EysST1DpE/s800/2012-08-30%252520-%25252002%252520-%252520Irene%252527s%252520Arete.jpg\"></a><br>\r\r\n<b><i>Irene\'s Arete, unknown to us at the time.</i></b><br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\n<a href=\"https://picasaweb.google.com/105894936663116565516/20120830TetonsWStephGarnetCanyonApproachMiddleTetonII56#5787572664012016610\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"http://lh4.ggpht.com/-MqpIsWg17jU/UFGWrI4yi-I/AAAAAAABUKA/BBtCgpx3KgU/s800/2012-08-30%252520-%25252004a%252520-%252520Irene%252527s%252520Arete.jpg\"></a><br>\r\r\n<b><i>We suspected this was Irene\'s Arete but still were not quite sure.</i></b><br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\n<a href=\"https://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/IowJJm1-RZ-eJQ3FV1GnTtMTjNZETYmyPJy0liipFm0?feat=directlink\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-dl5MWXVZwUQ/UIEScNPf7lI/AAAAAAABb9I/htkzdVDaRmg/s800/2012-08-27%2520-%252021%2520-%2520Irene%2527s%2520Arete%2520from%2520the%2520Meadows%2520-%2520annotated.jpg\"></a><br>\r\r\n<b><i>Irene\'s Arete from the Meadows.

This is definitely the best way to go as it stays most in line with the ridge, protects well, and is really fun!<br>\r\r\nI was intimidated by the exposure, though. You have to step across a wide gap into a stance at an undercling, and then undercling and lieback out left on a very steep wall, with several hundred feet of air beneath you. I don\'t really like exposure. I stepped over a few times, backed off, looked down at the tempting 5.8 finish that looked so friendly, but not nearly so inspiring. So I talked myself into the direct finish by saying I would \'check it out\', and if I could see a reasonable gear placement close by, I would climb up to it and inch forward a few more moves.

I was intrigued with the idea of climbing the lower pitches for full credit, rather than doing the standard start of traversing out on a ledge several hundred feet higher.

The first time I climbed Temple Crag was on a Sierra Challenge day, and with a smaller pack I was all right soloing the awkward 5.4 slot.

There was one part that was awkward enough with packs that we both were glad to have used the rope. <br>\r\r\nWe wandered up the long sloping plateau of Temple Crag and picked out a nice bivy spot to make camp. We enjoyed a leisurely dinner, watching the spectacular alpenglow cast upon Middle Palisade, Norman Clyde Peak, and the Palisade Crest. Tony had never camped out high like this before, and this was his first time in the Palisades, so this was quite a treat!

However, as their topo indicated P2 as 5.8, which felt much harder to me, I had my doubts about being fast on the 5.9 and speed was a paramount concern for today. So Tony the rope gun launched off.

It looked harder to bypass than it turned out to be. The 5.9 corner after was a surprise though!

This is understandable as the pitch up from the notch has very few identifiable features. It is mostly a sea of steep rock with small cracks, corners, and bulges everywhere. We couldn\'t see anything \'roof-like\', but Tony took off up what looked like the best line.<br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\nTony linked the next two pitches in a great lead. The terrain was really steep and slightly runout and once again was mostly sport-like face climbing rather than jamming cracks. Supposedly P10 was 5.6 turning to 5.7 and P11 had a 5.10a roof. I guess we took the wrong line as P10 felt like 5.8 right off the ledge, had sparse pro, no wide crack (indicated in the topo) and there was a 5.10a/b-ish crux, but there was nothing roof-like encountered. The crux, at the end, was more like a shallow corner passing through a very steep, almost overhanging face section, split by a strange finger crack that you could sort of jam, but not really.<br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\n<a href=\"https://picasaweb.google.com/105894936663116565516/20120929to1001DarkStarWithTonyNguyenV510c16P#5794993917071470578\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"http://lh3.ggpht.com/-1qb05FqGiA8/UGv0Q66YL_I/AAAAAAABaoc/qU5FATIxSOw/s800/2012-09-30%252520-%25252032%252520-%252520Tony%252520leading%252520P10-P11.jpg\"></a><br>\r\r\n<b><i>Tony leading P10-P11.

Perhaps in summer days you will get a bit of sunshine, but expect shaded, cold climbing until one reached the crest of the Lower Buttress. From there the route stays mostly in the sun.<br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\nAs if the Grade V designation isn\'t enough of a hint, this is a long route, so start early, move fast, and simul or solo most of the pitches above P3. Also, the Middle Buttress is much larger and takes more time to cross than the topos lead one to believe, so don\'t get casual after the Lower Buttress like we did!<br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\nWhen simul-climbing the Lower Buttress, shorten the rope if simul-climbing before the chimney. After the chimney, 60m is fine and you can simul to the base of the Middle Buttress (nice sunny lunch/nap bench). Shorten the rope to 30m for simul-climbing on the Middle Buttress - 60m is too long and drag will eat you up and force some belays.<br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\nThe rappels can all be downclimbed at 5.6 or less, with reasonably solid rock - however routefinding to do so is tricky if you\'re not used to simul-climbing complex alpine ridges.<br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\nI only know of two topos for this route - the one from Moynier  &amp; Fiddler\'s great guidebook, \"Climbing California\'s High Sierra: The Classic Climbs on Rock and Ice\", and the one from Peter Croft\'s guidebook \"The Good, The Great, and the Awesome\". While Croft\'s topo is less detailed and clean, I\'d say it is the more accurate and informative topo and does not mislead one into thinking the simul-climbing distances are shorter than they are. We didn\'t bring that one along but looking at it after the climb, I wish we had! <br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\nLooking on SuperTopo, it appears that Chris McNamara and Brock Wagstaff have basically combined and improved upon these two topos. So the best and most complete one I\'ve seen is found at the link below:<br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\n<b>(<a href=\"http://www.wagstaffarchitects.com/climbing/darkstartopo.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Dark Star Topo</a>)</b><br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\n<i>Only suggestion is on P14, you can also go left of the crest on cl. 3-5, and it misses the 5.10  &amp; 5.8 variations that finish on the upper buttress. Also, I thought P2 was harder than 5.8 (maybe because my hands were cold and I was tired from the long pitch?), P7 was easier than 5.8, and on P6, climbing out on the face is optional and for knowing the technique the chimney was more like 5.6-5.7, including the finish if you stay in the crack.</i>\r\n</div> \r\n'),(32,'t11757n','/tr/Yosemite-Point-Buttress-Direct-IV-5-9-14P/t11757n.html','Yosemite Point Buttress, \'Direct\' (IV, 5.9+, 14P)','content: <div class=\"articletext\">\r\n<div class=\"photonormal\">\r\n<table valign=\"top\" border=\"0\" width=\"476\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" class=\"sdw_box\">\r\n			<tr>\r\n			  <td><img src=\"/nav_img/top_left_sdw.gif\" width=\"13\" height=\"13\"></td>\r\n			  <td class=\"sdw_top\"></td>\r\n			  <td><img src=\"/nav_img/top_right_sdw.gif\" width=\"13\" height=\"13\"></td>\r\n			</tr>\r\n			<tr>\r\n			  <td class=\"sdw_left\"></td>\r\n			  <td class=\"sdw_body\" width=\"450\"><div>\r\n<a href=\"javascript:photoZoom(\'Ojw_Pz4kJCYrJg,,\')\" title=\"Click to enlarge\"><img src=\"http://www.supertopo.com/photos/14/86/270149_2024_L.jpg\" width=\"450\" height=\"600\" name=\"\" alt=\"Fixed cam at the 5.9 crux transition from chimneying to OW climbing on...\"></a><span class=\"small\"><br>Fixed cam at the 5.9 crux transition from chimneying to OW climbing on P3 of Yosemite Point Buttress.<br><div class=\"photo-credit\">Credit: PellucidWombat</div></span>\r\n</div></td>\r\n			  <td class=\"sdw_right\"></td>\r\n			</tr>\r\n			<tr>\r\n			  <td><img src=\"/nav_img/bottom_left_sdw.gif\" width=\"13\" height=\"13\"></td>\r\n			  <td class=\"sdw_bottom\"></td>\r\n			  <td><img src=\"/nav_img/bottom_right_sdw.gif\" width=\"13\" height=\"13\"></td>\r\n			</tr>\r\n		  </table>\r\n</div>\r\n<br>\r\r\nI prepped myself for leading all of the cruxy wide on this climb by sleeping 3 hours, puking up breakfast on the RR of Sunnyside Bench (off-route, don\'t worry), then eating only 400 calories for the day. Fortunately, like saving the star player for the final inning, while I led the earlier wide pitches that Nic was not happy to lead, Nic finished off by leading the face &amp; rotten pitches I was not happy to lead. All in all, 21 hours car-to-car, so it was either that long, or we were that slow. Either way, we had fun.<br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\nOr in a more refined way to put it . . .<br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\nYPB, a Yosemite Classic, or Classic Yosemite? I\'d say neither, and both. In a way it is classic, but it is NOT a Type I Fun sort of classic that people are accustomed to in Yosemite. There are some brushy sections, and a lot of the rock is loose or exfoliating. It also lacks the elegance of many of the lines in Yosemite, making the routefinding very difficult and the route much more reminiscent of an alpine climb (I have never climbed such an indirect \'direct\' variation). However, there are some stellar pitches, the views from the route are wonderful, and it is a good looong rock climb. The approach is also not to be underestimated involves a lot of hiking, cross-country travel, and scrambling or simul-climbing just to reach the base of the first pitch, nearly 2,000 ft above the Valley floor. However, it is Classic Yosemite in that it has lots of burly wide climbing, stout face climbing, some incredible hand cracks, and huge exposure at the end.<br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\nI would like to give special thank to Clint Cummins for helping me figure out this route when I was attempting to match the Reid topo to the terrain from recon photos I had taken. Without such help we surely would have gotten even more lost and spent more time climbing in the dark!<br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\nStandard Wombat Warning applies to this trip report. For those that want to keep the route mysterious, don\'t read any further!<br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\n<div class=\"horizontalrule\"><hr></div>\r\n<br>\r\r\nI first became intrigued with the route when I stumbled across the topo in the Reid guide. Looking around online, including the SuperTopo forums, I became more interested in the route, but information on the route was still vague. So heading in to this climb, there was still a lot of mystery surrounding the route. <br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\n<a href=\"https://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/rrTDsxQDealCIBByZ8QlP9MTjNZETYmyPJy0liipFm0?feat=directlink\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-km3ofoP2Vcw/UJoiBj0kTRI/AAAAAAABco0/ztosi_tPS1E/s600/2012-04-22%2520-%2520058%2520-%2520Yosemite%2520Falls%2520Right%2520-%2520annotated.jpg\"></a><br>\r\r\n<b><i>Yosemite Point Buttress area from Pharoahs Beard Area.</i></b><br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\n<a href=\"https://picasaweb.google.com/105894936663116565516/20121020YosemitePointButtressDirectWNicIV59#5803167674359757538\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"http://lh3.ggpht.com/-XRWFVF7whgw/UIj-QNo-OuI/AAAAAAABcGU/98oIH6lRCps/s800/2012-09-16%252520-%25252012a%252520-%252520Yosemite%252520Point%252520Buttress%252520%252526%252520Lost%252520Arrow%252520Spire%252520from%252520P2%252520of%252520SS%252520-%252520annotated.jpg\"></a><br>\r\r\n<b><i>Yosemite Point Buttress and Lost Arrow Spire seen from Steck-Salathe.</i></b><br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\n<a href=\"https://picasaweb.google.com/105894936663116565516/20121020YosemitePointButtressDirectWNicIV59#5803167611730843906\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"http://lh3.ggpht.com/-sMp-4SnUI8Y/UIj-MkVE2QI/AAAAAAABcF8/fozxPrLQVp8/s800/2012-03-03%252520-%25252011%252520-%252520YPB%252520Beta%252520Shot%252520-%252520annotated.jpg\"></a><br>\r\r\n<b><i>Yosemite Point Buttress from the top of Lena\'s Lieback</i></b><br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\n<a href=\"https://picasaweb.google.com/105894936663116565516/20121020YosemitePointButtressDirectWNicIV59#5803167643460868034\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"http://lh4.ggpht.com/-_BfQnirvYy4/UIj-OaiGl8I/AAAAAAABcGE/awhDzLPajrQ/s800/2012-03-04%252520-%25252002%252520-%252520Yosemite%252520Pt%252520Buttress%252520Close%252520-%252520annotated.jpg\"></a><br>\r\r\n<b><i>Lost Arrow Spire and Yosemite Point Buttress</i></b><br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\nNic Risser and I were fired up and ready to go for the route in May of 2012. A few days before our climb, I received an urgent e-mail from my friend Val, asking if I had already or was about to climb YPB, and if I handn\'t, to e-mail her right away. Hmm, that\'s strange. I had never even told Val about the climb . . . Also, Val was working with the NPS for determining closures for raptor nesting, so I already knew what this must be about. I was tempted to pretend to not see the e-mail until the next week, but gave in to my conscience and responded.<br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\nVal had done a Google search for YPB, and my recon photos for figuring out the route had come up! She had also seen raptors flying right around The Pedestal. The route was slated to be closed that weekend, and we were asked to not go up, even before the closure, as the birds had been sighted.

We soloed most of it, but as we had never done the climb before and it was dark, we somehow got off route near the top. We belayed the final pitch, which had a piton and some bolts (? The SuperTopo topo doesn\'t show any!), so despite the holdup we were glad to have gotten the rope out. I wasn\'t feeling too hot with the Pop Tart I ate for breakfast, so my stomache jettisoned it and the pre-climb water chug at the base of this mystery pitch. Not the best way to start a long, sunny route. I learned later that I had also left most of my food for the day back in the bear box.<br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\nFrom atop the RR, there was a well traveled trail that ended near the waterfall at the far left edge of the ledge.

I clipped the slings, traversed about 20\' over on a ledge, and found thin 5.7 face climbing. This part was trickier to figure out and more runout for the follower than expected. I found an OK cam placement and downclimbed thin 5.7 face for about 20\'. I attempted to get in a  small C3 cam in the only possible pro placement, but rope drag popped this out, so the follower has no pro for this entire section after cleaning the first piece. From there I traverse about 15\' right, and then about 10\' back up and right to intersect a corner to set up a belay, hopefully with better fall potential for Nic than if I downclimbed straight down to a ledge below. <br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\nRope drag for the face climbing was horrendous.

There really isn\'t any pro for a ways.</i></b><br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\nThe ledge below had a large tree with slings. I suspect we should have gone there and began the P6 traverse from there. <br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\nNow, this is where it seems a lot of people get lost, and I think we were off-route a bit too. Perhaps Clint can clarify here where we should have gone versus where we wandered, but if I understand where we were aiming for, then I think I worked it out (as shown in the xRez annotated images at the beginning of the report). I\'m uncertain here as what we ultimately did really didn\'t match the topo in any way.<br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\nBasically, after the 5.7 traverse right and downclimb at the end of P5, end P5 at the ledge with a large tree. DO NOT ascend the crack above, but instead traverse farther right around the arete, reaching a smaller ledge and a piton in a small crack. From here, climb up a shallow gully and climb over and up beyond several corner systems, taking the easiest line, until you are in the last corner next to the white granite wall. From here climb straight up until rope drag or rope length stops you. There are many belay options.<br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\nWhat we did, in contrast, was we had ended P5 in the crack, and intuition would say to keep climbing up the crack, as although it looked hard, it was clean, protectable, and looked like fun 5.8-5.10. Instead, I climbed partway up until I could take the next crack branching to the right, cutting through the arete (thinking this was the \"hand traverse\" I had noted on a leaning crack on P6 in the Reid Topo). This was harder than it looked! After rounding the corner and seeing sparse face climbing and a good ledge below, I downclimbed, found the piton, saw the ledge ending about there, so I climbed back up to what looked like a better way to get into the next corner system, and picked my way up and across perhaps two more corner systems before I started climbing straight up again. This wandering cost us some time, and the drag was bad. <br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\n<a href=\"https://picasaweb.google.com/105894936663116565516/20121020YosemitePointButtressDirectWNicIV59#5803168590028634162\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"http://lh3.ggpht.com/-pBstwKxI4jk/UIj_FgxceDI/AAAAAAABcLs/-FCO8_E5nfo/s800/2012-10-20%252520-%25252038%252520-%252520Looking%252520down%252520on%252520P6%252520traverse.jpg\"></a><br>\r\r\n<b><i>Looking down from P6 on the continuing traverse.</i></b><br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\n<a href=\"https://picasaweb.google.com/105894936663116565516/20121020YosemitePointButtressDirectWNicIV59#5803168608441966530\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"http://lh4.ggpht.com/-hif5XPgBknw/UIj_GlXhn8I/AAAAAAABcL0/hAQIt99V4Xg/s800/2012-10-20%252520-%25252039%252520-%252520P6%252520More%252520Traversing.jpg\"></a><br>\r\r\n<b><i>P6 traversing around more corners. 5.6-5.7.</i></b><br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\n<a href=\"https://picasaweb.google.com/105894936663116565516/20121020YosemitePointButtressDirectWNicIV59#5803168632673996834\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"http://lh5.ggpht.com/-msneyTUyCGQ/UIj_H_o5ECI/AAAAAAABcL8/Dt4HPvXTBYA/s800/2012-10-20%252520-%25252040%252520-%252520Looking%252520down%252520P6.jpg\"></a><br>\r\r\n<b><i>Looking down P6.</i></b><br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\nRope drag stopped me somewhere near the end of 60m.

From here you turn back right and ascend another easy chimney. This one is wide, mostly stemming, and you tunnel behind a large chockstone. The Reid guide shows P8 ending atop this chimney after it slants left, but Nic stopped short, on a ledge to the right of the chimney just after the chockstone.

This traverse is pretty long, maybe 100\', and you down climb maybe 40\'. It is mostly unprotectable and has some of the worst granite I have ever climbed. You could rip off granite chunks with your hands, willy nilly, and the face was nothing but ball bearings of gritty granite. You could never rub enough off to get smooth surface. The ledges were covered in sand and chunks of granite grit and scree. At least it was no harder than low 5th. This had me wary of what the Rotten Chimney would be like.<br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\nI turned the last corner, going farther over and down than expected, then walked partway up the chute until I could make a small, 2-piece anchor in the wall on my right.

The rotten chimney is a left-side in back-to-foot chimney and there is no pro until you reach the chockstones atop the first step. Still, this was only about 10\' up and not too hard - maybe 5.6-5.7, but the rock on the foot side of the chimney is covered in exfoliating flakes. Still not too bad, as with care you could find clear spaces to smear your feet, or if lacking that, scrape away the granite flakes with your toe to make a good foot placement.<br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\n<a href=\"https://picasaweb.google.com/105894936663116565516/20121020YosemitePointButtressDirectWNicIV59#5803168812135031010\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"http://lh5.ggpht.com/-_BWMH2AFn8M/UIj_ScLvIOI/AAAAAAABcM8/goUvCVwp-WQ/s800/2012-10-20%252520-%25252050%252520-%252520P10%252520Rotten%252520Chimney.jpg\"></a><br>\r\r\n<b><i>P10 Rotten Chimney.

There is a rope-eating notch between the boulders and even with a directional, rope drag was awful, and I had to set up the belay specifically to work with the directional to keep the rope out of the crack.

The \'lieback\' was sustained 5.9 for maybe the next 50 ft or so before it gradually eased off to 5.8 as it turned more vertical. Although there were a few slightly mungy parts, the pitch was very high quality. A \"lieback\" is the best way to describe it, but it really was strange, requiring a lot of mixed techniques.

We didn\'t find anything like this. The P11 belay was off of a good piton and solid gear, at a nice ledge.<br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\nHowever, as best as we could follow the topo and get a good belay, P12 started off at 5.10R before reaching the wonderful hand crack. Nic had to downclimb about 20 ft before doing a very difficult friction traverse around the corner into a wild, wide stem. From there he zipped up the crack about 30 ft before placing his first piece so that I had proper protection to follow the entry. Thanks!<br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\n<i>(Looking at some other climbers\' photos, it appears you could end P11 early and belay in the bombay chimney beneath the stem. The climb up to the crack looks tricky but probably not nearly as difficult as the face traverse. However, the belay might have been more marginal. I wonder if that is the better way though . . .)</i><br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\n<a href=\"https://picasaweb.google.com/105894936663116565516/20121020YosemitePointButtressDirectWNicIV59#5803169066705668626\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"http://lh4.ggpht.com/-IaLyfyRIW0s/UIj_hQiGyhI/AAAAAAABcO8/uvNClT2ebZ4/s800/2012-10-20%252520-%25252061%252520-%252520Nic%252520Leading%252520P2%252520crack.jpg\"></a><br>\r\r\n<b><i>Nic leading P12 crack.

The Reid guide shows the P12 belay here, but with the 60m rope Nic was able to go up a ways further on easy ground to a nice, large ledge and a small gear anchor. I think we made the anchor at the optional belay between P12  &amp; P13 in the Reid guide.<br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\nWhen I followed, I was slow on the face traverse - it was very hard and intimidating to follow. Props to Nic on the great lead! Once I was in the crack, I had a lot of fun. Pitch 12 and Pitch 3 are definitely my favorite pitches of the climb.

Such a sweet crack!</i></b><br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\nThe final 30 ft before the roof crux was the best, with tight hands (Red Camalot) in a laser cut crack that leaned about 50-60 degrees, requiring an interesting sequence of movements with one foot flagging on the face, one foot in the crack, and your arms twisted around to be jammed in the crack. It was a nice endurance workout.<br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\nThe roof-corner was mungy and felt more like a bouldering problem to surmount. It was protected nicely by two pitons high and left. After the roof I made quick work getting up to Nic. During the time we were climbing pitches 11 &amp; 12, we heard shouts from the Valley floor. It sounded like someone was shouting my name. Since we knew friends down there who were aware of our plans, we figured our lights high up on the wall were rather conspicuous, so as we climbed on we occasionally shouted and yodeled back.<br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\nThese last two pitches were definitely 5 star pitches. Despite the darkness and fatigue, we were having a blast. Still, we had the last two pitches left, which we had heard were quit bad . . .<br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\n<b><u>Exit Pitches</u></b><br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\n<a href=\"https://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/8aMUXIySPLH_T_Fwhvy9x9MTjNZETYmyPJy0liipFm0?feat=directlink\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-Lud38VifxVA/ULnbNZM4hmI/AAAAAAABj1s/dV3eTTGs4Zo/s640/YPB%2520E%2520Side%2520-%2520top%2520close.jpg\"></a><br>\r\r\n<b><i>My best deduction of where we went vs. where the Reid topo says to go</i></b><br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\n<a href=\"https://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/rir5Z5BSiWRsDWjR-_5totMTjNZETYmyPJy0liipFm0?feat=directlink\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-Tt_lT0_nM10/ULnb-5XDK3I/AAAAAAABj1o/Y1eo4uNqYCs/s640/YPB%2520S%2520Side%2520-%2520close.jpg\"></a><br>\r\r\n<b><i>My best deduction of where we went vs. where the Reid topo says to go</i></b><br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\nI would call Yosemite Point Buttress, \'Direct\', a 3-4 star climb if it weren\'t for the last two pitches. These last two pitches were frightening and really sucked. Perhaps some of this was due to us getting off route in the dark, though. Once again, I\'d like to give major props to Nic for leading these!<br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\nNic led off left on a large that pinched down to an extremely exposed, but easy traverse. Class 4, but no pro and very rotten rock. Basically P13 is low 5th, but is somewhat runout due to the rock being too rotten for pro. It also breaks off in your hands, so take care with what you grab. It was quite interesting to break off large chunks of rock and never hear the impact as they sailed off into the darkness. There was also a lot of dirt and sand mixed that blew into your face - I was still finding bits of P13-14 lodged in my nose and ears for the next few days and several rounds of showering.<br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\nI suspect after the first traverse left (about 50 ft or so) and short climb up, Nic should have hung a hard right and traversed back that way, but it was hard to tell in the dark with our headlamps. Nic went more straight up and left, and found himself on a 5.10a finger crack at one point. Following this pitch, I followed up a detached flake. After breaking off the edges from some hand jams and stepping on the edge of the flake (resulting in some flailing to catch myself from falling), I really didn\'t like climbing right up the 4\' wide flake as the entire thing vibrated. I was waiting for the entire thing to break off once I was fully bear hugging it. At last the terrain eased and I traversed up a slot and ledge system to the right, reaching Nic at a nice belay at a large pine tree.<br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\nThe ants here were active and did a good amount of biting as I belayed Nic up the final pitch. He saw a nice long ledge system traversing right and gradually up at class 4, but he wanted off the route NOW! Like an angry beast, he attacked the final 15 ft headwall directly. He made grunting noises on this part even louder than the wide pitches below. I could tell he was struggling to take an unnecessary, direct finish. Since he climbs much harder than me, I was a tad concerned.<br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\n\"Now Nic, don\'t forget that I have to follow that thing!\" I shouted. He backed off a bit to back up some gear, and renewed his attack. A few more grunts, scrapes, and curses later and finally the rope started moving quickly and then stopped. Now it was my turn. The finish Nic took was very tricky, and perhaps 5.10b (his best assessment. All I can say is it was hard!) A very awkward and off-balance corner in rotten rock led to a sandy, sloping ledge, requiring a funny heel hook &amp; body torque to surmount.<br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\nWe topped out just before midnight. There we drank the rest of our water, ate the rest of our food, and took a 20 minute nap before heading down the Yosemite Falls trail, which was a mercifully easy descent. We made it into our sleeping bags at Upper Pines at about 3am.<br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\n<a href=\"https://picasaweb.google.com/105894936663116565516/20121020YosemitePointButtressDirectWNicIV59#5803169119024619634\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"http://lh4.ggpht.com/-Z-n9SRIwAHs/UIj_kTb6oHI/AAAAAAABcPU/jsrvUzyo7sQ/s800/2012-10-20%252520-%25252063%252520-%252520YPB%252520Defeat%252520Group%252520Shot.jpg\"></a><br>\r\r\n<b><i>Obviously we\'re stoked to be done with the route.</i></b><br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\n<a href=\"https://picasaweb.google.com/105894936663116565516/20121020YosemitePointButtressDirectWNicIV59#5803169137935423970\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"http://lh4.ggpht.com/-U6-Q0sbDkMY/UIj_lZ4mmeI/AAAAAAABcPc/tFrV0yRQfBo/s800/2012-10-20%252520-%25252064%252520-%252520YPB%252520Nic%252520Defeat%252520Shot.jpg\"></a><br>\r\r\n<b><i>Nic after climbing Yosemite Point Buttress.

Knowing the approach ahead of time helps, but if you don\'t, just factor in routefinding time. It took us about 2hrs of continuous movement to complete it, including soloing the final few hundred feet. Simul-climbing this section might be preferred by others.<br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\nDon\'t haul packs on this route or it will take you forever. I read that if you try to haul P3, your pack WILL get stuck in the top of the bombay chimney. The route gets sun all day (hot), but also gets a lot of sudden wind (cold), so bring a jacket (one for climbing OW in might be nice) and a lot of water. A large pack for the follower might be problematic in the wide pitches, so I feel like our strategy of climbing with two small, equal-sized packs worked well. <br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\nBe familiar with trailing packs on wide and pushing cams for this climb. With the wide, I\'d say you should be solid at Valley 5.8-5.9 wide before tackling this climb. None of it felt quite as hard as the hardest bits of the NE Buttress of Higher Cathedral Rock, but there was more of it here, it was tighter, and trailing a pack on lead makes it difficult in different ways. I felt like the wide pitches on this route were very high quality. Nic felt like the 5.9 face sections were hard and thin enough that one should be a solid 5.10a friction &amp; face leader before tackling this climb. <br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\nWe felt like our rack was just about right for the climb. We brought doubles from 0.3\" to 3\", and then C4 Camalots of 1x#4, 1x#5 &amp; 1x#6. It was very nice to have the wide cams for the wide pitches. Also, kneepads might be a good idea. We were glad to have ours on.\r\n</div> \r\n'),(33,'t11782n','/tr/The-DEER-Route-A-Yosemite-Reverse-Spelunking-Adventure/t11782n.html','The DEER Route - A Yosemite Reverse Spelunking Adventure','content: <div class=\"articletext\">\r\n<div class=\"photonormal\">\r\n<table valign=\"top\" border=\"0\" width=\"476\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" class=\"sdw_box\">\r\n			<tr>\r\n			  <td><img src=\"/nav_img/top_left_sdw.gif\" width=\"13\" height=\"13\"></td>\r\n			  <td class=\"sdw_top\"></td>\r\n			  <td><img src=\"/nav_img/top_right_sdw.gif\" width=\"13\" height=\"13\"></td>\r\n			</tr>\r\n			<tr>\r\n			  <td class=\"sdw_left\"></td>\r\n			  <td class=\"sdw_body\" width=\"450\"><div>\r\n<a href=\"javascript:photoZoom(\'Ojw5Oj4pICQhIg,,\')\" title=\"Click to enlarge\"><img src=\"http://www.supertopo.com/photos/15/48/276293_27455_L.jpg\" width=\"450\" height=\"600\" name=\"\" alt=\"Looking back on the Chockstone Traverse before the first squeeze\"></a><span class=\"small\"><br>Looking back on the Chockstone Traverse before the first squeeze<br><div class=\"photo-credit\">Credit: PellucidWombat</div></span>\r\n</div></td>\r\n			  <td class=\"sdw_right\"></td>\r\n			</tr>\r\n			<tr>\r\n			  <td><img src=\"/nav_img/bottom_left_sdw.gif\" width=\"13\" height=\"13\"></td>\r\n			  <td class=\"sdw_bottom\"></td>\r\n			  <td><img src=\"/nav_img/bottom_right_sdw.gif\" width=\"13\" height=\"13\"></td>\r\n			</tr>\r\n		  </table>\r\n</div>\r\n<b><u>November 23, 2012</u></b><br>\r\r\nAt long last Nutjob and I were able to meet up to check out this obscure mystery route.

We finished off the day by climbing one of the best routes in Arches and one of my favorite desert towers: The Three Penguins. We climbed the Right Chimney, which has an overhanging 5.10c thin hands section on P1, and then a 5.10a/b OW on P2.

We couldn\'t find it in any of the guidebooks (of +3 we had that covered the area) so we decided to check it out. Could it really be a good route that hadn\'t been done yet? I was doubtful, but we couldn\'t see any slings at the top . . . As Arches no longer allows any bolts to be placed, we figured we could simul-rapp off of opposite sides of the fin after finishing. Unfortunately it was too good to be true, as when we walked a few hundred yards up a creek bed towards it, I spotted some slings hanging from bolts on the backside of a tower that formed out of the corner. Doh! It looked like a nice line, but as it wasn\'t as tempting as a FA, we went on to some guaranteed classics. It is probably in the 5.10+ to 5.11 range.

However, several other guidebooks called the crack 5.9+, and I\'d agree that it is more like 5.9+, and not too sandy as compared to some of the other climbs we had done in the park. Still, compared to Owl Rock (which is NOT representative of Arches climbing) and Indian Creek, this crack is less secure in jams, smearing, and pro, so you should have your desert climbing lead head on for this one.<br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\n<i>Note: I didn\'t think too seriously about cracks being described as sandy until I experienced some in Arches. Your feet slip much more on the facey bits when there is loose sand around, and you can seriously feel your hand and foot jams are not as secure. You have to set them harder or pull harder to the side to get the secure. I can also visualize much more here either cams blowing out the rock or shearing straight out of a crack like they can out of one lined with ice or calcite. Of course I\'m still developing my feel for this type of sandstone . . .</i><br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\n<a href=\"http://lh6.ggpht.com/-5lzz2DKFsxI/UK62eHALEpI/AAAAAAABieI/18eCBLE8D5k/s2000/2012-11-13%252520-%25252006%252520-%252520100%252520Yard%252520Wall%252520-%252520Chinese%252520Eyes%252520-%252520Leading%252520-%252520by%252520Dirk%252520Summers.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"http://lh6.ggpht.com/-5lzz2DKFsxI/UK62eHALEpI/AAAAAAABieI/18eCBLE8D5k/s800/2012-11-13%252520-%25252006%252520-%252520100%252520Yard%252520Wall%252520-%252520Chinese%252520Eyes%252520-%252520Leading%252520-%252520by%252520Dirk%252520Summers.jpg\"></a><br>\r\r\n<b><i>Leading Chinese Eyes.

The crack takes a #4.5 BD Camalot the entire way. SuperTopo recommends bringing 2, with one to leave partway up as a backup, and the other to push to the top. We brought 1 #4.5 Camalot and 1 new #5 C4 Camalot. I was a wuss and pushed both along with me to the top! (I\'m still not trusty of the sandy crack, and I can still see myself kicking a cam out if I fell). One was on a tether so I could move it up and high more easily, and the other I had clipped to the rope to move along as a backup that I could ditch whenever it became inconvenient to move.

Dirk solidly led the semi-runout Lizard Rock, which was literally a few minutes\' walk from our campsite. We then headed over to Arches in hopes of climbing Dark Angel with the remainder of the day. It has a long approach compared to most other climbs in the park, but the hike is on a well-maintained trail and is a very scenic and a nostalgic one for me.

At one point we awoke to a loud rumble as part of a cliff above us broke off. I guess it was a good thing that we called it quits in the Fishers yesterday! Still, things seemed to be drying out well in the morning, and we couldn\'t bear to leave without indulging in one last temptation, a quick tick of climbing Lizard Rock. It is only about a 3 minute walk from our campsite, so it was a nice way to start the day. The standard routes on it are rated \'R\' in our various guidebooks, and the rock was potentially weaker, but Dirk being ever the adventurer was game to check it out and give leading it a go.

The skies still looked like there was a potential for rain, so we decided to do something non-committing and nice to visit even if the rock seemed too wet to climb. So we drove into Arches to hike out to Dark Angel and maybe climb the West Face. I was a bit wary about the route as one of the guidebooks that was as recent as the 90s reported the 5.9 fingers to be sandy, the bolts to be of poor enough quality that you wouldn\'t want to take a free-climbing fall on them, and a sandy runout 5.4 finish.<br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\n<a href=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-TN9VqkhHSF8/UO5fKEzXItI/AAAAAAABoKQ/1TW_kgGrDJM/s2000/2012-11-18%2520-%252030%2520-%2520Dark%2520Angel%2520-%2520West%2520Face%2520-%2520annotated.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-TN9VqkhHSF8/UO5fKEzXItI/AAAAAAABoKQ/1TW_kgGrDJM/s800/2012-11-18%2520-%252030%2520-%2520Dark%2520Angel%2520-%2520West%2520Face%2520-%2520annotated.jpg\"></a><br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\nWe had a nice hike out, and were happy to note that the rainy night we had in the Fishers had not extended as far west as Arches, as everything was very dry. One memorable part of this climb is the trail to Double Arch is one of the more popular trails in Arches, but Dark Angel, about 4 miles in at the end of the trail, is the only feature that attracts the occasional climber. So here we were speeding down the trail with our ropes and climbing gear, passing families, foreign tourists, and groups of school kids.

The knife edge eventually ended, and there were no rappel slings in sight or good blocks to sling, so I backtracked and looked down on a little buttress on the West side of the fin.<br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\n<a href=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-W5d0ei-zcEI/UAyqKz_j0UI/AAAAAAABLPM/S0db4d3CNjk/s2000/2012-07-06%2520-%252037%2520-%2520Looking%2520back%2520to%2520future%2520high%2520camp%2520on%2520annoying%2520traverse%2520-%2520annotated.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-W5d0ei-zcEI/UAyqKz_j0UI/AAAAAAABLPM/S0db4d3CNjk/s800/2012-07-06%2520-%252037%2520-%2520Looking%2520back%2520to%2520future%2520high%2520camp%2520on%2520annoying%2520traverse%2520-%2520annotated.jpg\"></a><br>\r\r\n<b><i>Route annotation looking back at the second approach crux where a second rappel or precarious downclimb must be made.

However, the rock seemed a bit better here and I thought I saw a reasonable downclimb from here. It looked improbably at first, but I had a hunch and figured it would be faster and safer than rappeling. I lowered off of a couple of steep drops and traversed on some catwalks, taking care to avoid the loose rocks. The loose rocks were dangerous here, but if you looked carefully you could climb around them. I then flipped the rope over a horn to direct the rope for Nastia just before a final steep downclimb. Overall I\'d rate this downclimb a stiff class 3 to easy class 4, but with great caution needed with the loose rock.<br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\n<a href=\"http://lh5.ggpht.com/-VO3y2eyi2wQ/T_v2DXh4s7I/AAAAAAABKy8/QvC362PS9fk/s2000/2012-07-06%252520-%25252034%252520-%252520Class%2525203%252520Downclimb.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"http://lh5.ggpht.com/-VO3y2eyi2wQ/T_v2DXh4s7I/AAAAAAABKy8/QvC362PS9fk/s800/2012-07-06%252520-%25252034%252520-%252520Class%2525203%252520Downclimb.jpg\"></a><br>\r\r\n<b><i>Class 3 downclimb.</i></b><br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\nApparently Nastia found new rappel slings a bit farther down and behind the buttress (probably left from the climbers before us), but I encouraged her to just downclimb to me.

We climbed up slopes of consistently 40 degree steepness and eventually reached a choke some 50 feet long where the snow had thinned enough that melt-freeze cycles had caused it to form ice. This was one of the sketchier climbing moments of the approach as I led up it, since the ice was so thin that often my crampons would penetrate through and get stopped by the slabs &amp; rock slurry beneath, and there was really no place for rock, snow, or ice pro until you are through the crux.

It seemed that I could have shoveled out a ledge, but Nastia had talked me into leaving the snow shovel behind to save weight and bulk, with the idea that we could get by with our ice tools. Unfortunately for this spot that didn\'t seem very feasible.<br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\nUnfortunately the sun was setting and the rest of the ridge beyond didn\'t look any more promising, and none of the guidebooks had listed camping sides any closer to the route, so we doubted we would find anything more going farther. We had no choice but to reverse our tracks and set up our tent at the base of the last dowclimbing/rappel. We got to camp well after dark, chopped out a space for the tent, and went to sleep well after midnight.<br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\n<i>(Note: Later when we looked over route info, it turns out that the bivy site before the Thumb Gendarme was about 200 ft back along the ridge crest, on the East side of the ridge. From where we were we couldn\'t see anything in that direction, and the East side dropped off precipitously, but when we later reviewed photos from other climbers, apparently there is a hidden niche just beside the last highpoint. If there is enough snow to stay on the ridge crest, you could probably see this obvious site as you crested the rise before the Thumb Gendarme. If you take the bypass, you must keep this in mind.)</i><br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\n<div class=\"horizontalrule\"><hr></div>\r\n<div class=\"horizontalrule\"><hr></div>\r\n<br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\n<b><u>Day 2 Rest Day</u></b><br>\r\r\nAt least we were pretty tired from the 6,000 ft gain approach the day before, and I was concerned about Nastia acclimatizing sufficiently as she had been unable to get high before the trip as she had planned due to bad weather. So we decided to sleep in and spend a day at the high camp recovering and acclimatizing.

Of course it was too late to care about that by now, but I\'ve noted it for future beta.<br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\nStaying right on the ridge crest, eventually it turns into a knife edge and cliffs out again.

We couldn\'t reverse the route, so we would have to downclimb 1,500 ft to the Carbon Glacier, somehow get past the giant bergschrund, and pick our way off that glacier to get out. This was frustrating as we only had about 1,000 ft of steep elevation gain, mostly on snow, and we would be above the danger and could safely continue over the summit. Nastia really didn\'t want to turn around but I felt like we were building up too many deficits.<br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\nAs we reversed our tracks and started downclimbing off the ridge, we had a nice sunrise view of climbers ascending Liberty Ridge.

The traverse over looked to be very fast, and if we forewent the harder, more direct variations, it looked like we could quickly traverse through most dangerous parts of the cliffs and be in safe enough terrain to continue. In case the rocks were loose, I could tell that if you stayed right at the base of the first cliff band, you would be beneath any projectiles sailing off from above, and this path could be approached from the ridge crest.

One hazard we hadn\'t considered was that as the day warmed, the rocks lining the ridge above would drop ever-increasing amounts of rocks down our slope. Since the entire ridge is line with rocks, there really is no line that is safe from this, and the lower we got, the more exposed we were to rockfall from above.<br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\nI have become accustomed to the buzzing sound that rocks make when they fly by in the air, but in this case the slope was low angle enough and soft enough that rocks did not sail, but it was steep enough that they still flew down at very high velocities, but the soft snow dampened the sound of the incoming missiles. Smaller rocks made a rat-tat-tat-tat noise like a machine gun, growing louder as the pinwheel got closer. There were even some large, flat, table-sized blocks that just made quiet hissing as they shot down the slope. They carried enough momentum that if they hit one of us or snagged the rope, things would have gotten bad in a hurry.<br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\nNeedless to say, we moved as fast as we could until we neared the massive bergschrund, then took our best guess on where we might find a crossing. Just as we began traversing to what looked like a pinch in the \'schrund, direct sunlight started to appear on the rocks and slopes above, and rocks began raining down at a much higher rate. We booked it to a short, steep cliff band that would provide protection as rocks sailed overhead or were deflected to the side.<br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\nFrom there we could see maybe one spot with a bridge large enough to climb over, but it was thin and looked likely that we would punch through. Plus it was in the line of fire. The snow where we hid was supersaturated and as I climbed along the rock edge I kept sinking in up to my waist or sometimes deeper if I hit the moat. This was not solid enough to make a safe bollard out of. After some searching along the rocks I managed to find a place to build a reasonably sufficient anchor out of a nut and cam. We built up the anchor and I rappelled off the lip and into the bergschrund, which was much too wide to clear.<br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\n<a href=\"http://lh4.ggpht.com/--Wva7UPrbFA/T_v2zal7AfI/AAAAAAABK1o/GSLkTkzr7fA/s2000/2012-07-08%252520-%25252011%252520-%252520Rapping%252520into%252520the%252520Carbon%252520Glacier%252520Bergschrund.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"http://lh4.ggpht.com/--Wva7UPrbFA/T_v2zal7AfI/AAAAAAABK1o/GSLkTkzr7fA/s800/2012-07-08%252520-%25252011%252520-%252520Rapping%252520into%252520the%252520Carbon%252520Glacier%252520Bergschrund.jpg\"></a><br>\r\r\n<b><i>This is what bailing on Curtis Ridge looks like.

Nastia arrived just after the downpour started. We were drained from this outing. Exhausted, we drove back to Portland where I\'d have a rest day before returning to work. This was a very memorable route, but I am still on the fence as to whether I will return to it.

The descriptions made it sound semi-serious with tricky routefinding, but given how fast and easily we knocked off the NE Face of Pingora the day before, we figured we could make short work of this climb and hike out the same day to try some climbs in the Tetons (ha!).<br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\nUnfortunately, the published guidebook description and line didn\'t match Radek\'s account of the climb, which led us off route. Then once we located ourselves, the exit pitch was indicated very differently between the two sources. We should have believed Radek over the guidebook! Also, the route itself was quite humbling as it was far more unnverving than expected. Ultimately we prevailed and completed a seldom-done climb that is gritty, grassy, stout, and often runout, but takes a great line up a gorgeous peak. We found this climb to be MUCH harder and it took us MUCH longer than the IV, 5.8 NE Face of Pingora that we climed 2 days prior. Don\'t do this one unless you lead much harder than 5.8!<br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\n<b><u>Confusion</u></b><br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\nSo given a choice between a published guide that you paid money for and assumed has been vetted, versus the casual recollections of a climber that he wrote down and drew up during spare time at work and distributed for free online, which one would you take? Upon casual glance, the routes appeared to be the same, but as we climbed up the face, their descriptions began to differ from each other and what we encountered. We erred on following Bechtel\'s guidebook, but in the end we were sorry that we had doubted Radek!<br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\n<a href=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-WKC9U9j-h8M/UTWuVHk1ccI/AAAAAAABtkI/IF7ol4tFdkY/s2000/2012-08-24%2520-%252001%2520-%2520War%2520Bonnett%2520from%2520Jackass%2520Pass%2520-%2520annotated%2520Guides.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-WKC9U9j-h8M/UTWuVHk1ccI/AAAAAAABtkI/IF7ol4tFdkY/s900/2012-08-24%2520-%252001%2520-%2520War%2520Bonnett%2520from%2520Jackass%2520Pass%2520-%2520annotated%2520Guides.jpg\"></a><br>\r\r\n<b><i>War Bonnet\'s NE Face seen from near Jackass Pass, and route lines laid down in retrospect . . .</i></b><br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\n<a href=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-FJ9qlmCMCR8/UTWuWf9BVgI/AAAAAAABtkQ/cuYiqVpW4co/s2000/2012-08-24%2520-%252001%2520-%2520War%2520Bonnett%2520from%2520Jackass%2520Pass%2520-%2520annotated%2520Ours.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-FJ9qlmCMCR8/UTWuWf9BVgI/AAAAAAABtkQ/cuYiqVpW4co/s900/2012-08-24%2520-%252001%2520-%2520War%2520Bonnett%2520from%2520Jackass%2520Pass%2520-%2520annotated%2520Ours.jpg\"></a><br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\n<b><u>Approach</u></b><br>\r\r\n<a href=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-9imZL0WLyAE/UFInB4H4h3I/AAAAAAABPQ0/3-A4OOPpm6g/s1600/2012-08-23%252520-%25252003%252520-%252520Watch%252520Tower%252520%252526%252520Others%252520under%252520alpenglow.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-9imZL0WLyAE/UFInB4H4h3I/AAAAAAABPQ0/3-A4OOPpm6g/s900/2012-08-23%252520-%25252003%252520-%252520Watch%252520Tower%252520%252526%252520Others%252520under%252520alpenglow.jpg\"></a><br>\r\r\n<b><i>Watch Tower and others under morning alpenglow.</i></b><br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\n<a href=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-hXx-Pw0BuxQ/UFInAKmQHeI/AAAAAAABPQs/6m-PFkTGSlY/s1600/2012-08-23%252520-%25252001%252520-%252520War%252520Bonnett%252520in%252520the%252520morning.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-hXx-Pw0BuxQ/UFInAKmQHeI/AAAAAAABPQs/6m-PFkTGSlY/s900/2012-08-23%252520-%25252001%252520-%252520War%252520Bonnett%252520in%252520the%252520morning.jpg\"></a><br>\r\r\n<b><i>War Bonnet under alpenglow.</i></b><br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\n<a href=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-9BN39T2qpRI/UFInAtFapVI/AAAAAAABPQw/76jZPocflgw/s1600/2012-08-23%252520-%25252002%252520-%252520War%252520Bonnett%252520upper%252520NE%252520Face.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-9BN39T2qpRI/UFInAtFapVI/AAAAAAABPQw/76jZPocflgw/s900/2012-08-23%252520-%25252002%252520-%252520War%252520Bonnett%252520upper%252520NE%252520Face.jpg\"></a><br>\r\r\n<b><i>NE Face of War Bonnet. Check out that slender free-standing spire on the lower left! </i></b><br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\nAs the direct approach was melted out and we didn\'t like the idea of wet 5th class slabs that we might have to belay, we opted for the longer, cl. 3-4 route with less first-hand information. So we hiked over the climber\'s version of Jackass Pass, descended a hundred feet or so before picking our way over on a ledge system. Now, we had in mind that the switchback would be smaller than it was, and that the cl. 4 might be old school, so we were ready for some harder soloing. So when the ledge seemed to choke off, we started up a broken ledge system above us.<br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\nDon\'t do that.<br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\nI ended up in iffy 5th class terrain, and the ledges above looked less reasonable as I got higher, so we had to work out a retreat option.

Just as you near the east summit, when the summit ridge starts rising again, look for a way to cut to the right of the crest. It is straightforward enough to downclimb some very steep, but solid cl. 3-4 terrain for about a hundred feet or so before reaching the sand and talus slope. From there it is an easy romp to camp. We started the downclimb just when we needed to use our headlamps, so it really can\'t be that tricky if you hit it right.<br>\r\r\n  <br>\r\r\n<a href=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-wonVKwU9qsc/T7IRgDqqKdI/AAAAAAABGiU/gkMHMNdFgxE/s1600/2012-05-13%252520-%25252001%252520-%252520Mt%252520Russell%252520at%252520Night.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-wonVKwU9qsc/T7IRgDqqKdI/AAAAAAABGiU/gkMHMNdFgxE/s800/2012-05-13%252520-%25252001%252520-%252520Mt%252520Russell%252520at%252520Night.jpg\"></a>  <br>\r\r\n<b><i>Mt Russell at night.</i></b><br>\r\r\n  <br>\r\r\n  <br>\r\r\n<a href=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-lB_91NAFIfw/T7IRh3ISVkI/AAAAAAABGik/FipABGXNG1s/s1600/2012-05-13%252520-%25252004%252520-%252520Mt%252520Russell%252520from%252520Bivy.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-lB_91NAFIfw/T7IRh3ISVkI/AAAAAAABGik/FipABGXNG1s/s800/2012-05-13%252520-%25252004%252520-%252520Mt%252520Russell%252520from%252520Bivy.jpg\"></a> <br>\r\r\n<b><i>Perfect bivy view of Mt Russell.</i></b><br>\r\r\n  <br>\r\r\n  <br>\r\r\n<a href=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-cNJYPcxQX7s/T7_Lp5HFnII/AAAAAAABKJs/UML5T59mYOE/s1600/2012-05-11%252520-%25252027%252520-%252520Mt%252520Russell%252520from%252520E%252520Buttress-annotated.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-cNJYPcxQX7s/T7_Lp5HFnII/AAAAAAABKJs/UML5T59mYOE/s800/2012-05-11%252520-%25252027%252520-%252520Mt%252520Russell%252520from%252520E%252520Buttress-annotated.jpg\"></a>  <br>\r\r\n<b><i>Mt Russell from the E Buttress of Mt Whitney.</i></b><br>\r\r\n   <br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\n<a href=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-7nvNa8NH4ho/T7_Lq2uTSQI/AAAAAAABJ1w/YOtdK42l9Yc/s1600/2012-05-11%252520-%25252028%252520-%252520Mt%252520Russell%252520from%252520E%252520Buttress-annotated.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-7nvNa8NH4ho/T7_Lq2uTSQI/AAAAAAABJ1w/YOtdK42l9Yc/s800/2012-05-11%252520-%25252028%252520-%252520Mt%252520Russell%252520from%252520E%252520Buttress-annotated.jpg\"></a><br>\r\r\n<b><i>Mt Russell\'s Mithral Dihedral and Fishook Arete from the E Buttress of Mt Whitney.</i></b><br>\r\r\n  <br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\n<div class=\"horizontalrule\"><hr></div>\r\n<br>\r\r\n<u><b>Links</b></u><br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\n<a href=\"https://picasaweb.google.com/105894936663116565516/20120512RussellFishhookAreteWJaredWoodIII598P?authuser=0andfeat=directlink\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Picasa Album</a><br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\n\r\n</div> \r\n'),(41,'t11974n','/tr/Mt-Russell-Mithral-Dihedral-III-5-10-7P-Car-to-Car-via-a-Unique-Approach-Photo-TR/t11974n.html','Mt Russell, Mithral Dihedral (III, 5.10, 7P) Car-to-Car via a Unique Approach (Photo TR)','content: <div class=\"articletext\">\r\n<div class=\"photonormal\">\r\n<table valign=\"top\" border=\"0\" width=\"626\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" class=\"sdw_box\">\r\n			<tr>\r\n			  <td><img src=\"/nav_img/top_left_sdw.gif\" width=\"13\" height=\"13\"></td>\r\n			  <td class=\"sdw_top\"></td>\r\n			  <td><img src=\"/nav_img/top_right_sdw.gif\" width=\"13\" height=\"13\"></td>\r\n			</tr>\r\n			<tr>\r\n			  <td class=\"sdw_left\"></td>\r\n			  <td class=\"sdw_body\" width=\"600\"><div>\r\n<a href=\"javascript:photoZoom(\'Oj04Oj8pIyMkIQ,,\')\" title=\"Click to enlarge\"><img src=\"http://www.supertopo.com/photos/18/41/305592_6346_L.jpg\" width=\"600\" height=\"450\" name=\"\" alt=\"Jared following our linked pitches 3 &amp; 4 on Mithral Dihedal.

We started hiking at 3:30 am, and after whimsically taking a very interesting shortcut through Sakai Col, we reached the base of the climb about 5 hours since we first started. Jared accidentally linked P1 and P2 (oops. I linked P3 and P4 in a non-stop altitude-induced pant fest. Then I climbed P5 to finish the awesome dihedral. Jared led the next pitch and then we simul-climbed to the summit. The sun set as we descended the final scree chute to Upper Boy Scout Lake. Sleep-deprived, we took a few naps ACROSS the trail on the descent. I\'m not sure how long the naps were (one must have been at least an hour), but we got back to the car at 1:30am Sunday, making for a 22.5 hr outing!

We later learned that our route passed through what is called Sakai Col. This variation gave us some very interesting views of some seldom-climbed aretes on Mt Russell. Although this col requires an obnoxious amount of slogging on sandy side slopes and a big switchback, I think these unexpected views made this approach variation worthwhile.<br>\r\r\n

We didn\'t know too much about the wall, and the little bit of information out there was vague, misleading, or flat out wrong, but this just added to the FA-feeling of climbing here. Unfortunately the rock and cracks aren\'t nearly as good as it had appeared from far away. This first day we made it about halfway up the East Arete (IV, 5.10) and were shut down by an impasse . . . another time perhaps?

Until you\'ve experienced such cracks, you might not notice or care, but it makes them much more difficult to climb and protect!<br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\nThe route that I was most interested in was the East Arete. Assuming that Galen Rowell\'s description held for other parts of the wall, it sounded wonderful:<br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\n\" . ..  Parts-of the route are very steep, but <u>in places there are five to six cracks to choose from within a foot or two of one another</u>. The climbing is consistently 5.7-5.9, with a couple of 5.10 spots.\"<br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\nWhat we discovered was that the quote about the cracks, while sounding quite nice, is actually what makes the wall quite challenging! A more accurate wording would have been:<br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\n\". . . <u>in places there are five to six cracks to choose from within a foot or two of one another</u>. However, most of these cracks will take you off-route and merely serve to confuse the lead climber in their routefinding and make topos and written descriptions nearly worthless. Also, nearly all of these cracks are flaring, and usually shallow or wide, and very difficult to jam or protect.\"<br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\n<a href=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-if1wOlKEEvo/Ua97yiqzeWI/AAAAAAACQiU/Hu16Q734CxM/s1600/2013-05-25%252520-%25252062a%252520-%252520Ruby%252520Left%252520Wall%252520High%252520Res%252520Panorama%252520with%252520Nic%252520Returning%252520-%252520annotated.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-if1wOlKEEvo/Ua97yiqzeWI/AAAAAAACQiU/Hu16Q734CxM/s800/2013-05-25%252520-%25252062a%252520-%252520Ruby%252520Left%252520Wall%252520High%252520Res%252520Panorama%252520with%252520Nic%252520Returning%252520-%252520annotated.jpg\"></a><br>\r\r\n <b><i>Ruby Wall Left, with Nic returning.

When they asked us where we were going with all of our climbing gear, our response of \"Ruby Wall\" led to blank stares.<br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\nThe trail is very easy, and not too steep.

However, we were about to get spanked. One problem was it was very hard to match up and topo or route description on where to start! The most obvious feature marking the start of the route was a permanent snowfield. This was not too helpful this time of year. In fact, I wonder how different the base is once the snow has melted out. Another tricky thing is with the snow on the approach and descent (which likely would freeze at night), and cold daytime temps in the shade, we both had to climb with boots, crampons, ice axe, and puffy jackets in our packs, in addition to food and water for the day. The larger packs on both of us would make everything harder and more \'alpine\' in feel - especially all of the chimneys and corners.<br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\n<a href=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-sFiyoabUlRo/Uam2Z7H9Z-I/AAAAAAACPR0/sEanFRoZgSc/s1600/2013-05-25%252520-%25252031%252520-%252520Reaching%252520the%252520ledges%252520for%252520starting%252520the%252520East%252520Aretes%252520Routes.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-sFiyoabUlRo/Uam2Z7H9Z-I/AAAAAAACPR0/sEanFRoZgSc/s800/2013-05-25%252520-%25252031%252520-%252520Reaching%252520the%252520ledges%252520for%252520starting%252520the%252520East%252520Aretes%252520Routes.jpg\"></a><br>\r\r\n <b><i>Reaching the ledges for starting the East Aretes Routes.

We had a key photo showing that the next pitch for the Left East Arete went up and left from here (we were still undecided on doing Left or Rowell\'s East Arete), but we were focused enough on the nice big ledge above that we overlooked it. Nic stopped short (where he should have belayed for the next pitch of the Left East Arete), and suggested I run up to the better ledge. I tried this corner, which was a lot worse than it looked! More hummocks, dirt, grit, and flaring cracks with iffy jams and pro. On rappel I saw that it is better to take the right side of this wall even though it looks steeped and thinner.<br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\nOh well, we still were undecided on whether to climb it or the East Arete anyways, and we couldn\'t definitively tell where either one started, either.

Rating is as encountered and differs from Secor.</i></b> <br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\n			<br>\r\r\nOur third and final day climbing on Ruby Wall, Nic and I were determined to complete a route! We woke early and were climbing at a good time. As we were familiar with the approach to the East Aretes, we took those pitches, including the theorized better  P2 (whichw as better) and then started up the Left East Ridge. It was a great route and it fell together better than routefinding on the prior two days. Unfortunately, as we topped out, an  unforecast snow flurry hit us, which made the final traverse to the summit of Ruby Peak slow and difficult. We descended the East Ridge without problems, found a high traverse back to camp, and made it to the car at 1:30 am. Too bad we had lots of bad weather and active animals on the drive home! <br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\nMost of what we followed for the Left East Arete came from the route description on the East Arete on SummitPost. I believe those guys were mistaken with their naming, but their information was fairly accurate and very helpful.<br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\n 	<br>\r\r\n<a href=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-3-Arjeu44b4/Uam3QrQRjhI/AAAAAAACPUg/RNIvS3kl5ac/s1600/2013-05-27%252520-%25252002%252520-%252520Left%252520East%252520Arete%252520-%252520Nic%252520Leading%252520P1.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-3-Arjeu44b4/Uam3QrQRjhI/AAAAAAACPUg/RNIvS3kl5ac/s800/2013-05-27%252520-%25252002%252520-%252520Left%252520East%252520Arete%252520-%252520Nic%252520Leading%252520P1.jpg\"></a><br>\r\r\n <b><i>Nic leading P1, at the wide corner crux.</i></b> <br>\r\r\n					<br>\r\r\n			<br>\r\r\n<a href=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-CqEeMjhAbRw/Uam3VxDGUyI/AAAAAAACPUw/uy7jR9Yu6Bw/s1600/2013-05-27%252520-%25252006%252520-%252520Left%252520East%252520Arete%252520-%252520Looking%252520down%252520P2%252520chimney.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-CqEeMjhAbRw/Uam3VxDGUyI/AAAAAAACPUw/uy7jR9Yu6Bw/s800/2013-05-27%252520-%25252006%252520-%252520Left%252520East%252520Arete%252520-%252520Looking%252520down%252520P2%252520chimney.jpg\"></a><br>\r\r\n <b><i>Looking down the P2 chimney.

Sean Hermany and I climbed the N Couloir of North Peak and found the route to be fully in! Ice was just challenging enough, but not too hard. There was another team that forced their way past us (they simuled past me as I led P1, then stopped to pitch out the rest of the climb once above), so that was annoying and dangerous.<br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\nThis climb is a relatively straightforward snow and neve solo for most of the year, and a ski descent well into summer, but if you catch it just right in the Fall before the winter storms come, you can catch it in the coveted condition as a dark sheen of bullet-proof ice. In this condition, real alpine ice is much harder to climb than water ice of the same angle. In this respect, 40-50 degree alpine ice feels to me to be more on par with WI3.<br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\n<a href=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-7XWUJs76boU/TKFZTuHHueI/AAAAAAABy3o/OW-neq2N8xI/s1600/2010-09-25%252520-%25252003%252520-%252520North%252520Peak%252520alpenglow.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-7XWUJs76boU/TKFZTuHHueI/AAAAAAABy3o/OW-neq2N8xI/s800/2010-09-25%252520-%25252003%252520-%252520North%252520Peak%252520alpenglow.jpg\"></a><br>\r\r\n<b><i>Alpenglow on the north side of North Peak.

All of the pitches were sustained, and mostly continuous chimney or OW. While rated II 5.9 in Secor, compared to other OW that I have done, including the SW Face of Conness, I think this route warrants a 5.10a rating, and a grade II+ to III- rating for how slow the pitches go with all of the wide. The rock was mostly pretty good, and I think we cleared out most of the loose blocks (intentionally or not).<br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\n<span class=\"article_h2\"></span><br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\nJared and I went out for a last attempt of the season to do Winchell\'s SW Ridge - the route requires a long day and early start, so warm weather and long days are helpful. We left the Bay Area a little before 4am, drove straight to the TH, hiked in fast and set up camp beneath Isosceles . . . and decided to do the II 5.9 route that splits the triangle as a quick approach day climb. No information was given on the route except the FA, rating, and vague description. While is is called the West Face, we felt like West Face \'Bisector\' was a more appropriate name - especially that now it is one of 3 routes on the West Face.<br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\nUnfortunately, the climb took us into the night, so we arrived at camp too late and trashed for Winchell. No matter the time it took us. I think the route trashed us physically enough that Winchell would have been ruled out even if we had gotten back to camp before dark as planned :-)<br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\n<a href=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-3OHp9xlfv2M/UkPBVXoL2xI/AAAAAAACx9I/Ps-0znl37mM/s1600/2013-09-23%252520-%252520001%252520-%252520Isosceles%252520Pk%252520W%252520Face%252520-%252520IMG_3105.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-3OHp9xlfv2M/UkPBVXoL2xI/AAAAAAACx9I/Ps-0znl37mM/s800/2013-09-23%252520-%252520001%252520-%252520Isosceles%252520Pk%252520W%252520Face%252520-%252520IMG_3105.jpg\"></a><br>\r\r\n<b><i>The South Lake Reservoir was shockingly empty when Steph Abegg and I passed by at the end of June.

Intrigued by his photos and FA tales, LeBruce and I kept it in mind. Last weekend we headed up to the Ribbon Falls area to check out this forgotten classic. Chockstone Chimney climbs several pitches of various chimney types, with a few noteworthy tunnel-throughs, tree climbing within chimneys, and topping out on a large forested ledge, known as Sherwood Forest, that is rarely visited by climbers. The route was dirty, but interesting, and stayed fairly moderate throughout. The 5 or so rappels needed to get down were trickier than expected, and had obviously not been used in well over a year. The one new bolt had been damaged by rockfall and I could remove it with my hand, and in the end we used up all 30\' of rapp webbing rebuilding anchors. It was a good day of adventurin\'!<br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\n<a href=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-n3mqxUnaBpY/UkxHgGY8HwI/AAAAAAACyk8/QdQoC8ITDHA/s1600/2013-09-28%252520-%252520001%252520-%252520Chockstone%252520Chimney%252520-%252520IMG_3164.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-n3mqxUnaBpY/UkxHgGY8HwI/AAAAAAACyk8/QdQoC8ITDHA/s800/2013-09-28%252520-%252520001%252520-%252520Chockstone%252520Chimney%252520-%252520IMG_3164.jpg\"></a><br>\r\r\n<b><i>Approaching Chockstone Chimney, which ascend the right corner to the sky.</i></b><br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\n<a href=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-JQI997WGQkA/UkxHht-h9II/AAAAAAACylE/okC1sj0-CWg/s1600/2013-09-28%252520-%252520002%252520-%252520Chockstone%252520Chimney%252520-%252520IMG_3165.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-JQI997WGQkA/UkxHht-h9II/AAAAAAACylE/okC1sj0-CWg/s800/2013-09-28%252520-%252520002%252520-%252520Chockstone%252520Chimney%252520-%252520IMG_3165.jpg\"></a><br>\r\r\n<b><i>Chockstone Chimney.</i></b><br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\n<a href=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-9Sk6Yi0QlMM/Uk5JPIIEhAI/AAAAAAACzFw/vmImO_15n28/s1600/2013-09-28%252520-%252520003a%252520-%252520Chockstone%252520Chimney%252520-%252520IMG_1839.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-9Sk6Yi0QlMM/Uk5JPIIEhAI/AAAAAAACzFw/vmImO_15n28/s800/2013-09-28%252520-%252520003a%252520-%252520Chockstone%252520Chimney%252520-%252520IMG_1839.jpg\"></a><br>\r\r\n<b><i>Dirty scramble up to the start.

Just two Utahns eager to climb. The poor weather forecast for the Bugaboos got me and Alec to change our plans, and stop by Gimli Peak in the Valhalla Range on our way to our main objective on our long trip out from Salt Lake City. The final drive was reputed to be a rough dirt road, that was maybe passable in a Subaru. We didn\'t have a Subaru, nor 4WD, but no one said that was required. However, due to cut funding for Provincial Parks in British Columbia, the road has gotten into much worse shape since the travel information had been written. Fortunately, we were driving Alec\'s car, and he has had some wild times driving it through a lot of rugged desert country. We nearly bottomed out twice, but barely made it to the trailhead thanks to Alec\'s bold and skillful driving. Everyone else at the trailhead was in a truck, SUV, or some other high clearance or 4WD vehicle, so naturally they ventured over to investigate this unexpected vehicle and where it was from!<br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\n<a href=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-IeJ2B5t3wuM/Uhbtjaq8pWI/AAAAAAACfCE/CP3nef325UE/s1600/2013-07-27%252520-%252520005%252520-%252520Gimli%252520-%252520IMG_1902.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-IeJ2B5t3wuM/Uhbtjaq8pWI/AAAAAAACfCE/CP3nef325UE/s900/2013-07-27%252520-%252520005%252520-%252520Gimli%252520-%252520IMG_1902.jpg\"></a><br>\r\r\n<b><i>The three summit of Mt Prestley towering above the dirt road on the way to Gimli. The dirt road is fine here but gets very bad near the end.</i></b><br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\nThe trailhead was surprisingly crowded for such an out-of-the way place, with German tourists, a large group of French Canadians from Quebec, and a variety of other travelers. Fortunately most of the crowd was either coming out, or only doing the class 3 scramble up Gimli. There was one other party vying for our route, but in the end they joined their friends on the class 3 and we had this classic line all to ourselves!<br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\n<a href=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-mixWfg7gGAc/Uhbty9ZMeaI/AAAAAAACfCY/yU3XJEILWdg/s1600/2013-07-27%252520-%252520006%252520-%252520Gimli%252520-%252520IMG_1906.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-mixWfg7gGAc/Uhbty9ZMeaI/AAAAAAACfCY/yU3XJEILWdg/s900/2013-07-27%252520-%252520006%252520-%252520Gimli%252520-%252520IMG_1906.jpg\"></a><br>\r\r\n<b><i>Alec and his car ready to go. The wire mesh is to keep rubber-eating porcupines from getting in and eating the tires! I think our mesh extends high enough to keep bears out, too. </i></b><br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\nI was attracted to this route after first seeing <a href=\"http://www.stephabegg.com/home/tripreports/britishcolumbia/gimli\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Steph Abegg\'s TR on her website</a>, and later seeing <a href=\"http://www.ericandlucie.com/Gimli/Gimli.htm\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Eric &amp; Lucie\'s account on their website</a>. Its inclusion in lists such as <a href=\"http://lamountaineers.org/NAC/browserf/other/climlist/clindex.htm\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">North American Classic Climbs</a> and <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Beckeys-Favorite-North-American-Climbs/dp/0980122716/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1376800047&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=fred+beckey%27s+100+favorite+north+american+climbs\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Fred Beckey\'s 100 Favorite North American Climbs</a> further reinforced for me the idea that this place was well worth visiting, even though it was out of the way of most other international climbing destinations in BC, and few other climbing friends of mine had heard of it (Alec included). I am very glad that we made this detour! The scenery was beautiful, the campsite was wonderful, mountain goats plentiful and friendly, and the climbing was excellent. Although it can be climbed car-to-car reasonable enough, the bivy at the base is so nice that I\'d say it would be a shame to do it this way unless you are pressed for time. There is even a toilet and food storage lockers, so there is no need to worry about packing in or out extra gear like a bear canister or wag bags. We hiked in the evening we arrived, then did the climb, descended, and drove to Revelstoke the following day.<br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\nThe South Ridge was originally rated 5.8, but has since been re-rated in some sources to 5.10, with the big roof seeming to be the most commonly considered crux of the route. I felt like a section on P1 was harder, and the topo in Beckey\'s book shows this lower crux at a comparable rating. The lower crux was more committing and physical, but straightforward on the moves, while the upper crux is intimidating and requires some thinking, but it can be well protected and is only a couple of moves, although height can play a big role in how hard those moves are. Still, compared to climbs I have done in Yosemite, the High Sierra, and Southern Utah, I\'d say 5.10 is a generous rating for the route. It really is more like 5.9- to 5.9+, so solid 5.9 leaders shouldn\'t be discouraged from getting on this one.<br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\nThe route itself is surprisingly steep for being mostly 5.7, and it is like this due to all of the horizontal dike bands. It reminds me of an alpine version of some of the climbing classics at Lover\'s Leap.<br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\n<a href=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-bgQo7L1NkvQ/Uhbt0k9JMbI/AAAAAAACfCg/_drPlwkmF8o/s1600/2013-07-27%252520-%252520007%252520-%252520Gimli%252520-%252520IMG_1905.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-bgQo7L1NkvQ/Uhbt0k9JMbI/AAAAAAACfCg/_drPlwkmF8o/s900/2013-07-27%252520-%252520007%252520-%252520Gimli%252520-%252520IMG_1905.jpg\"></a><br>\r\r\n<b><i>Gimli Peak seen from the trailhead.

However, as it is only cl. 4, with a big couloir slog leading to the scramble, I had the idea of doing this route in a way similar to a lot of other routes that have since gotten physically or technically easy or more mundane for me compared to many other Sierra slogs and boulder-hops - find a way to make it harder, or more interesting and unique. Google Earth and the Topo! CD program are great sources for generating crazy ideas (many of which have been great successes!), so this was another climb born of late night computer play and Sierra Nevada sipping. The idea had come to be:<br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\n1. Do the route in the winter<br>\r\r\n2. Sleep on the west side of the crest to catch evening alpenglow and take some unique night photos<br>\r\r\n3. Combine the route with the intriguing NW Ridge - the most rational way to do this, as it seemed to me, was to approach the SW Couloir from the north rather than the more common Paiute Pass from the south, as the NW Ridge returns one to the same crest crossing, making a nice loop if one carries over their camp.<br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\n<a href=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-P9vgN1jVArE/UU2VkxjT4nI/AAAAAAACnMs/hp_FVMVkpIY/s1600/2013-03-17%252520-%252520Humphreys%252520SW%252520Couloir%252520-%252520Topo.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-P9vgN1jVArE/UU2VkxjT4nI/AAAAAAACnMs/hp_FVMVkpIY/s800/2013-03-17%252520-%252520Humphreys%252520SW%252520Couloir%252520-%252520Topo.jpg\"></a><br>\r\r\n<b><i>Topo Map - Humphreys SW Couloir.

I desperately needed a night in the mountains, some days of sweating and gasping in the cold, and a nice environment for reflection on my future. Unfortunately, I couldn\'t find any takers for the weekend for this idea, and as it was my only weekend I felt I could take off from PE studying, I was insistent on doing the climb anyways, so I decided to do this as my first solo outing in the Sierra.<br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\nThe trip was a great success, and although I didn\'t have any partners for the climb, Mike D., Andrew G., and Jonathan C. joined me on the drive up, but split off for their own ski descent ambitions on Mt Emerson\'s North Couloir and Zebra Couloir. Snow conditions were horrible, but doable if you didn\'t give up, and the avalanche danger was low at the time. I brought a rope &amp; light rack, but found none of it necessary, although I did appreciate having the rope to rappel one particularly thin and snowy section. This would have been a perfect weekend of recharging from life if my car hadn\'t caught fire on the drive home, but eh, what can you do? At least I got out!<br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\n<b><u>The Knee</u></b><br>\r\r\n<i>(Sorry for the rant. To me this is relevant for the climb. If you don\'t care, skip ahead to the next section which is back on topic).</i><br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\nI knew something was wrong with my left knee since 2010, before I had gotten much into trad climbing and was still mostly scrambling cycling, skiing, and jogging. At the time I figured the locking and instability was my rebuilt ACL loosening up. I was not in a sufficient insurance situation to dare get it diagnosed as I knew I couldn\'t afford treatment, and I didn\'t want to have a pre-existing condition once my employment and insurance situation improved. So I wore a brace, stopped jogging and skiing, and over the years saw my abilities to do long days of hiking and scrambling in the mountains slowly diminish. Recovery took longer, and my knee got more sore and stiff on the long rides between Berkeley and the Sierra. However, rock climbing rose to fill the gap . . . until last winter. I was getting strangely sore after climbing, and needed a post-climbing IPA a little too much for pain relief rather than relaxation. In January, climbing at Arch Rock with my good friend, Nic, burnt me out in a day with only a few pitches of 5.10 climbing, and I was left with a lingering background pain that wouldn\'t go away. My insurance situation still hadn\'t changed in the past 3 years, but at this point I knew I needed to see an orthopedist. The X-Ray results were not good.

The first surgeon said that I was heading straight towards a total knee replacement, and at 29, I was way too young for such a thing. He said I should stop all activity right away and go in to surgery immediately for an osteotomy, where he would cut open my femur and insert a wedge to change the line of force through my knee to better align with where I still had cartilage.<br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\nFor a number of reasons, this did NOT feel right to me, so I got two other surgeon opinions. Basically, I learned that any treatment, even non-treatment, is controversial, especially for me as the cartilage damage was so large, I am knock-kneed and am now highly arthritic. Reconstruction could be attempted, but would be extremely expensive, and the longevity of such a repair was highly uncertain, especially for someone with my complicating factors. The third surgeon suggested I just burn out the knee with the help of steroid and cortisone shots, and continue doing the things I loved. So long as I didn\'t return to running or skiing, I could probably make it to an appropriate age for a total knee replacement.<br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\nSo at the time of this climb, I was lying low in hopes that my knee pain would diminish, and was preparing for a slow downward spiral of burning out my knee over the years ahead . . . or maybe doing the reconstructive surgery anyways.<br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\nSince I really didn\'t know what to expect out of my knee in terms of pain or recovery, I was also wary of climbing with others as I didn\'t want to fail to live up to expectations, so in a way I was glad to head out solo, as that removed pressure to perform. I could just go out and see what I could still accomplish. This was to be the first of many \'experimentation\' outings this year where I learned what I could still do and expect, and how to reduce pain and swelling to sustainable levels.<br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\n<b><u>March 16, 2013</u></b><br>\r\r\nBetween low snow accumulation and driving a 4WD Subaru, this year for my first time ever I made it to about 8,500\' and within a few hundred yards of the end of the dirt road that accesses the East Arete of Mt Humphreys.

Much of the snow was a breakable crust with bottomless powder beneath. In this area it turned out to be the worst mix - the crust was just hard enough to <i>almost</i> work, but just as you leaned forward for the next step, you would punch through, icy snow grinding against your chins, until the penetrating foot hit a bush, root, or rock, suddenly stopping the plunge. Initially it was an occasional step, and only ankle deep, but eventually it came to be nearly every other stem and knee deep! With a heavier overnight pack on, it became tiring and demoralizing to constantly high-step on the high leg while mantling on the poles . . .<br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\n<a href=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-ipzkmtbUZ4I/UU2Ucc2HPyI/AAAAAAACm9I/xFPVlmhrHG0/s1600/2013-03-16%252520-%25252006%252520-%252520Slowshoes%252520and%252520breakable%252520crust.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-ipzkmtbUZ4I/UU2Ucc2HPyI/AAAAAAACm9I/xFPVlmhrHG0/s800/2013-03-16%252520-%25252006%252520-%252520Slowshoes%252520and%252520breakable%252520crust.jpg\"></a><br>\r\r\n<b><i>Slowshoes and breakable crust, getting up to my knee.

One of the worst experience was a headwall where I kept breaking in up to my waist. In the end it actually worked best for me to take off my pack, punch through and break trail to the top of the hill, then return to my pack, stomping on the snow as hard as I could. I still punched in a lot the second time up with my pack, but at least it was now doable.Fortunately I soon reached a point with some nice alpine views to take my mind off the tedium.<br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\n<a href=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-1Oq9cBubOuY/UU2UdQs5KxI/AAAAAAACm9c/RhMYjlHyb1Q/s1600/2013-03-16%252520-%25252008%252520-%252520Mt%252520Humphreys%252520N%252520Face.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-1Oq9cBubOuY/UU2UdQs5KxI/AAAAAAACm9c/RhMYjlHyb1Q/s800/2013-03-16%252520-%25252008%252520-%252520Mt%252520Humphreys%252520N%252520Face.jpg\"></a><br>\r\r\n<b><i>Mt Humphreys N Face.

Our Friday night arrival was late enough, and us tired enough when we awoke for the climb, that we cragged in Tuolumne Saturday, climbing Lucky Streaks and a fun obscure slab climb on Fairview Dome. With an earlier night\'s sleep Sunday we got a fairly early start (4:50am) on the approach. The first pitch was a slip &amp; slide, wet &amp; grassy, as advertised, but the rest of the climb was fantastic. Nic led the 5.10 face cruxes that I didn\'t dare lead, and I led the 5.10 OW that he didn\'t dare lead, so we made for a very compatible team on this climb. I did wimp out and bring along a Valley Giant - it turns out that I could have gotten by without, but I wouldn\'t have been nearly as relaxed! Another party showed up at about the same time as us, but fortunately we were able to work things out well enough sharing belay ledges.<br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\n<a href=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-gwedJGkAjc4/UnqjgrUO6-I/AAAAAAAC1U4/4lpNsUyheXw/s1600/2013-10-20%2520-%2520012%2520-%2520Solo%2520TR%2520%2526%2520North%2520Dome%2520-%2520DSC_0095a%2520-%2520annotated.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-gwedJGkAjc4/UnqjgrUO6-I/AAAAAAAC1U4/4lpNsUyheXw/s800/2013-10-20%2520-%2520012%2520-%2520Solo%2520TR%2520%2526%2520North%2520Dome%2520-%2520DSC_0095a%2520-%2520annotated.jpg\"></a><br>\r\r\n<b><i>The Southwest Face of Conness as seen from Indian Rock.</i></b><br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\n<a href=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-OfEzaT0Dn1k/UeZByasc2sI/AAAAAAACbsk/Gi3crGPaLFs/s1600/2013-07-14%252520-%252520002%252520-%252520IMG_1856.JPG\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-OfEzaT0Dn1k/UeZByasc2sI/AAAAAAACbsk/Gi3crGPaLFs/s800/2013-07-14%252520-%252520002%252520-%252520IMG_1856.JPG\"></a><br>\r\r\n<b><i>Mt Conness and the broad plateau.

This was to be my first real multi-day carryover of a technical climb, and I chose to do this as a prep-climb for my ambitious <a href=\"http://www.markpthomas.com/mountaineering/trip-reports/wyoming/teton-grand-slam-8-classic-routes-and-some-traverses-done-over-a-9-day-climbing-marathon\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Teton plans with Steph Abegg</a>, slated for September.<br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\nA lot of things slowed us up on day 1 (packs too heavy, not first on the route, group cluster at and beyond the Tyrolean, etc) so we had to bivy at the notch beneath pitch 9 with the team of 3 that was pretty much climbing in parallel with us. This delay cost us the traverse due to not having enough water to reach the next snowfield, plus we were just too tired as this was more of a butt-kicker than expected, but it was still a great experience climbing one of the longer, more classic routes in the Sierra with heavy packs!<br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\n<a href=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-BIfJcrpq1sI/UhbnwKz6fRI/AAAAAAACnAQ/cxq8SApQs3Q/s1600/2011-09-05%2520-%252004%2520-%2520Temple%2520Crag%2520from%25202nd%2520Lake%2520-%2520annotate%2520-%2520SRA.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-BIfJcrpq1sI/UhbnwKz6fRI/AAAAAAACnAQ/cxq8SApQs3Q/s800/2011-09-05%2520-%252004%2520-%2520Temple%2520Crag%2520from%25202nd%2520Lake%2520-%2520annotate%2520-%2520SRA.jpg\"></a><br>\r\r\n<b><i>Sun Ribbon Arete - Temple Crag from 2nd Lake (September 5, 2011)</i></b><br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\nApart from the cl. 3-4 pitch 2, I led all pitches, and I climbed with about a 35-40 lb pack (depending on the day) and 12 lb rack (from carrying doubles to #3). This was a good learning experience as first, neither of us fully appreciated how much harder and exhausting it would be to climb with heavy packs on (Jared had intended to swing many 5.7 leads, but changed his mind after following P1), and second, weight added up faster than expected. A post-climb analysis of what we brought and used, and a weight breakdown, made it easier to keep packs lighter on future carry-overs, and it was enlightening to see where it really mattered to trim weight (food) and where you were just stuck if you didn\'t move fast enough or place caches (e.g. water). Another important detail we overlooked was that the rack weighs a lot, so it really matters that the leader carries a lighter pack if both climbers are to climb with the same weight.

Jared and I expected to be slower, as the leader in the team of 3 got to lead with a bullet pack. As my pack was heavy, I planned to lead without it. I would haul my pack and Jared\'s at the same time to make the climbing easier for him. This was my first time experimenting with a hauling system for alpine climbing (using only Klemheists and a BD Guide in Guide Mode), and things worked out great. I hauled the packs on one line while belaying Jared on the other. Jared followed closely enough to unclip the bag rope from pro and tend the bags, and it turned out that I could haul the bags a bit faster than he could climb. We really didn\'t lose that much time doing this system as we caught up to the team of 3 in a few more pitches anyways. The only real problem that we had hauling was that I burned through the skin on the underside of my fingers, which made climbing somewhat less pleasant for the rest of the day. If you plan to do alpine hauling, especially with thin ropes like the doubles we used, I would recommend wearing gloves!<br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\n<a href=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-_ezOCMAi0gY/UBtz0jEVD1I/AAAAAAABLxM/S8Vcs5-NNcM/s1600/2012-07-29%252520-%25252004%252520-%252520Phil%252520Leading%252520P9%252520Crux%252520L%252520Variation.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-_ezOCMAi0gY/UBtz0jEVD1I/AAAAAAABLxM/S8Vcs5-NNcM/s800/2012-07-29%252520-%25252004%252520-%252520Phil%252520Leading%252520P9%252520Crux%252520L%252520Variation.jpg\"></a><br>\r\r\n<b><i>Phil leading the 5.10a Left Variation of pitch 9.</i></b><br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\n<a href=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-R9A-Y3mUdec/UBtz08tJrkI/AAAAAAABLxQ/dBMYPZrp-lM/s1600/2012-07-29%252520-%25252005%252520-%252520Alex%252520seconding%252520the%252520P9%252520Crux%252520traverse.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-R9A-Y3mUdec/UBtz08tJrkI/AAAAAAABLxQ/dBMYPZrp-lM/s800/2012-07-29%252520-%25252005%252520-%252520Alex%252520seconding%252520the%252520P9%252520Crux%252520traverse.jpg\"></a><br>\r\r\n<b><i>Alex following the Pitch 9 Left Variation, after the 5.9 crack and beginning the 5.10a face traverse.</i></b><br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\nThe 5.10a face traverse was very tough and heady for me, since I suck at face climbing. Unfortunately I had to hang midway through rather than risking a real fall onto very small gear. After the crux I tried climbing straight up a 5.6ish groove towards where Phil is in the above photo, but it was a rounded out groove without pro. I was pumped enough from the 5.10a section that I started losing my grip, so I quickly downclimbed back to a rest near pro. While less direct, it turns out that it is much better to traverse right all the way to the ridge crest and scramble up cl. 4 blocks on the backside. It is easy to avoid placing gear here and you can then flip the rope to trail in line above the crux (better for hauling) and you can flip the rope back over for the follower after they pass the crux.<br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\n<a href=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-7WqYyxSEljQ/UBtz1Wju7RI/AAAAAAABLxU/dnXWbfsgI7Q/s1600/2012-07-29%252520-%25252006%252520-%252520Christian%252520thirding%252520P9.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-7WqYyxSEljQ/UBtz1Wju7RI/AAAAAAABLxU/dnXWbfsgI7Q/s800/2012-07-29%252520-%25252006%252520-%252520Christian%252520thirding%252520P9.jpg\"></a><br>\r\r\n<b><i>Christian following the 5.9 hand crack on the Pitch 9 Left Variation.

The famous Beckey-Chouinard Route on South Howser Tower (V, 5.10, 19 pitches)was our main objective, and while ideally we would have warmed up on something easier like Bugaboo Spire, we had a perfect multi-day weather window that we couldn\'t afford to miss.<br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\nWe stopped and stayed at the hut the first day hiking in, as a heavy rain and sleet storm began just as we reached the Kain Hut. The second day we set up camp at Applebee Campground and traveled over to climb the classic West Ridge of Pigeon Spire on our way to setting up our bivy near South Howser Tower. We decided to bivy rather than a camp-to-camp push as Alec was wary of how much energy he\'d have for such a long push, and I was wary of how well my damaged knee could take such a large day (this year I have found that breaking up approaches &amp; climbs helps a lot).<br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\nIt took us about 2-3 hrs to descend to the toe of the ridge and scramble the first 1,000 ft to the base of the first roped pitch. From there we had many pitches of climbing consistently at 5.8-5.9! The only other people we saw were a guide and client who passed us, but otherwise we had this spectacular route to ourselves on this fine sunny day. It took us 12:45 hrs from the first roped pitch to the summit. We summitted with just enough time to do the 10 rappels for the descent before dark over 2:25 hrs, and reached our bivy just before we needed to turn on our headlamps. 19 hrs of fun!<br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\nThe timing was perfect as that night it rained on us, and the weather stayed off &amp; on rainy for the next few days.<br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\n<a href=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-io9YIcY0xJM/UnXs9W71i6I/AAAAAAAC1Rk/pTF_N-P-5lg/s1600/IMG_4484%2520-%2520annotated.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-io9YIcY0xJM/UnXs9W71i6I/AAAAAAAC1Rk/pTF_N-P-5lg/s800/IMG_4484%2520-%2520annotated.jpg\"></a><br>\r\r\n<b><i>Annotation of the route on an aerial photo taken by Steph Abegg on a flight with John Scurlock on September 24, 2011</i></b><br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\n<a href=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-MlwbNxDRUUM/UnXtE-AlL7I/AAAAAAAC1Rs/amT7KGqaSig/s1600/IMG_4595%2520-%2520annotated.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-MlwbNxDRUUM/UnXtE-AlL7I/AAAAAAAC1Rs/amT7KGqaSig/s800/IMG_4595%2520-%2520annotated.jpg\"></a><br>\r\r\n<b><i>Annotation of the route on an aerial photo taken by Steph Abegg on a flight with John Scurlock on September 24, 2011</i></b><br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\n<a href=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-MwTDhR-bOj8/Ul9Od6YZS6I/AAAAAAACz6M/vU2K1lDX-I0/s1600/Bugaboos%2520Region%2520ZOOM%252020%2520-%2520Maps%2520Howser.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-MwTDhR-bOj8/Ul9Od6YZS6I/AAAAAAACz6M/vU2K1lDX-I0/s800/Bugaboos%2520Region%2520ZOOM%252020%2520-%2520Maps%2520Howser.jpg\"></a><br>\r\r\n<b><i>Map of the Howser Towers and areas accessed from Bugaboo-Snowpatch Col</i></b><br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\nThis is a big route and requires an early start. We left our bivy at about 3:30am. In the dark we had to be careful to descend into East Creek through the right chute, and scramble up at the right spot to gain the ridge, but it all fell together easily enough with careful routefinding. We downclimbed some loose cl. 2-3 boulders from the col, then down a 25-30 degree snow slope for a short bit before things leveled off. Then it was mostly a gradual downhill stroll until we could identify a slope leading up to the ridge crest. From here the scrambling was mostly cl. 2 with occasional cl. 3 bits through large boulders, with maybe one cl. 4-5 part (I was lazy with routefinding). Our timing was just about perfect as we got to the base of the route at first light.

Plug in a #4 Camalot, plug in a leg, and resume climbing up!<br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\n(2) Climb higher, to the second ledge, and traverse a thinner sloping friction ledge into the chimney system about 8-10 ft higher, before first pro. This option was probably easier, technically, but seriously runout!<br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\nI took option 1 and found it to be the crux of the wide on the route. #4 camalot forever, in an irregular crack, so I had to take it out for each movement. Rests were tough, and I couldn\'t quite plug myself all the way in, but it was also hard to unplug myself with finesse. Very strange, awkward, and tiring climbing. I was very happy once I reached the chimney were I could rest and leave some pro behind me!<br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\n<a href=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-09N_RXG1OXY/Uht8DuF6ixI/AAAAAAACeig/t7eMmerZiME/s1600/2013-07-31%252520-%252520036%252520-%252520Beckey-Chouinard%252520-%252520IMG_2181.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-09N_RXG1OXY/Uht8DuF6ixI/AAAAAAACeig/t7eMmerZiME/s800/2013-07-31%252520-%252520036%252520-%252520Beckey-Chouinard%252520-%252520IMG_2181.jpg\"></a><br>\r\r\n<b><i>Looking down after the first OW (P12).

It reminded me of P2 on Reed\'s Direct in that it has a lean to it, and you are climbing a bunch of half-diamond-shaped holes.

I also had to take the #4 camalot out for each resetting. Eventually the hairline crack on my left opened up for an occasional thin nut or C3 to leave as a backup!

Could I be off route. Looking to my left, things looked familiar, and I realized that I was already at the 5.10 face traverse! It turns out the topo we had been using had assumed climbers would be breaking up the wide pitches into shorter ones, and by still doing close to 60m pitches, I had inadvertently linked a number of them. Unfortunately that meant that I led some of the pitches that were to be Alec\'s. Sorry!<br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\nThis final crux section involves either a C0 tension traverse with a 5.9 move to turn the corner, or a thin face traverse, once again with the crux being turning the corner, at 5.10a/5.10+/whatever. Some people thought this part was easy, and each topo had a different rating. I\'d call it more towards 5.10+, but then again, I suck at face climbing. While the pitons seemed pretty good, this traverse is still a bit dicey as the leader would take a large pendulum back into the corner if they fell at the crux, which is a ways out. It isn\'t so bad for the follower if the leader takes car to flip the rope and not place pro for a while on the easier terrain in the gully.<br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\n<a href=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-hnxzuA6b0vg/Uht8qnujYEI/AAAAAAACen8/RrpMd64_Egc/s1600/2013-07-31%252520-%252520046%252520-%252520Beckey-Chouinard%252520-%252520IMG_2193.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-hnxzuA6b0vg/Uht8qnujYEI/AAAAAAACen8/RrpMd64_Egc/s800/2013-07-31%252520-%252520046%252520-%252520Beckey-Chouinard%252520-%252520IMG_2193.jpg\"></a><br>\r\r\n<b><i>Alec traversing out on the crux 5.10 face traverse of P18.

It has been banned outright off and on in the past.<br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\n<b>Pack Strategy:</b><br>\r\r\nThis is an important and tricky thing to work out, as the route is so long, and has a lot of wide, that carrying packs is difficult. However, because it is so long and exposed, with need to travel on glaciate terrain and to be prepared for wind and potential bad weather, it is risky to travel too light as well. See the Glacier Travel logistics for what we chose to do with that extra gear.<br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\nFor us, what we tried and seemed to work well was bringing 2 packs: a moderate-sized camelback for the leader, and a larger pack (compressed Andanista Wild Things) for the follower. The leader carried a 3-liter camelback, a light jacket, and a small amount of food. The follower carried 1-2 liters of water to refill, both pair of boots, the glacier travel gear, and the bulkier jackets, in addition to some of the day\'s food, follower\'s light jacket, and first aid kit.<br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\nAlec only needed to trail the pack for a couple of sections on the wide climbing above the big sandy ledge, and no hauling was needed. As a follower, he was able to stay farther out and stem more on the wide sections. I was able to wear the follower pack on all of the pitches that I followed, with the toughest parts being pulling the 5.9+ lower roof crux, and the 5.10 face traverse near the end.<br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\n<b>Approach/Descent Glacier Travel Logistics:</b><br>\r\r\nThe descent to the base of the route is more serious than the glacier walk-off after the climb. We didn\'t find the routefindig hard or crevasses worrisome - in the conditions of the terrain (well-trodden path) and snow (not quite freezing) that we traveled in, we could have gotten by leaving our crampons behind and traveling unroped as we never traveled near any crevasses, and the angles rarely got all that steep (note, that nighttime freezing or lack of a path would have made crampons much more useful). Having one ax for the follower might be a good idea for insurance, though.<br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\nWith our 60m doubles, we could easily reach completely flat snow on the last rappel, and you could get pretty close even with a single 60m. There is nothing nearby to slide into if you had to slide the last little bit. From there it is an easy, low-angle walk back to the col. There are a couple of small crevasses that are easy to avoid with proper routefinding, and it was no worse than the walk in from Applebee campground.<br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\nSo in short, for our conditions, bringing 1 pair of crampons and 2 axes was overkill. We could have done just fine with one axe.<br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\n<b><u>Other Bugs/BC Rock Climbing Trip Reports</u></b><br>\r\r\n<a href=\"http://www.supertopo.com/tr/South-Ridge-of-Gimli-Peak-A-Lesser-Known-Canadian-Classic/t12165n.html\" target=\"_blank\">South Ridge of Gimli Peak - A Lesser-Known Canadian Classic</a><br>\r\r\n<a href=\"http://www.supertopo.com/tr/Pigeon-Spire-W-Ridge/t12243n.html\" target=\"_blank\">Pigeon Spire (W Ridge)</a><br>\r\r\n-<br>\r\r\n<a href=\"http://www.supertopo.com/tripreport/tripreport.php?articleid=12246\" target=\"_blank\">Crescent Tower (Lion\'s Way) - A Great R&amp;R (Rain &amp; Relaxation) Climb</a><br>\r\r\n<a href=\"http://www.supertopo.com/tr/Bugaboo-Spire-NE-Ridge/t12224n.html\" target=\"_blank\">Bugaboo Spire (NE Ridge)</a>\r\n</div> \r\n'),(51,'t12224n','/tr/Bugaboo-Spire-NE-Ridge/t12224n.html','Bugaboo Spire (NE Ridge)','content: <div class=\"articletext\">\r\n<div class=\"photonormal\">\r\n<table valign=\"top\" border=\"0\" width=\"626\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" class=\"sdw_box\">\r\n			<tr>\r\n			  <td><img src=\"/nav_img/top_left_sdw.gif\" width=\"13\" height=\"13\"></td>\r\n			  <td class=\"sdw_top\"></td>\r\n			  <td><img src=\"/nav_img/top_right_sdw.gif\" width=\"13\" height=\"13\"></td>\r\n			</tr>\r\n			<tr>\r\n			  <td class=\"sdw_left\"></td>\r\n			  <td class=\"sdw_body\" width=\"600\"><div>\r\n<a href=\"javascript:photoZoom(\'Oj47Oj4mICciLQ,,\')\" title=\"Click to enlarge\"><img src=\"http://www.supertopo.com/photos/21/34/334936_3614_L.jpg\" width=\"600\" height=\"394\" name=\"\" alt=\"2013-08-03 - Alpenglow on Snowpatch, Pigeon, and Bugbaboo Spire seen f...\"></a><span class=\"small\"><br>2013-08-03 - Alpenglow on Snowpatch, Pigeon, and Bugbaboo Spire seen from the slot we scrambled up to reach the col.<br><div class=\"photo-credit\">Credit: PellucidWombat</div></span>\r\n</div></td>\r\n			  <td class=\"sdw_right\"></td>\r\n			</tr>\r\n			<tr>\r\n			  <td><img src=\"/nav_img/bottom_left_sdw.gif\" width=\"13\" height=\"13\"></td>\r\n			  <td class=\"sdw_bottom\"></td>\r\n			  <td><img src=\"/nav_img/bottom_right_sdw.gif\" width=\"13\" height=\"13\"></td>\r\n			</tr>\r\n		  </table>\r\n</div>\r\n<br>\r\r\n<b><u>August 3, 2013</u></b><br>\r\r\nAfter several days of rain, with a continuing bleak forecast, Applebee Campground gradually emptied out until only a skeleton crew of me, Alec, and maybe 5-10 other climbers remained. After being denied Bugaboo Spire the day prior from weather that was much different than forecast, Alec and I moved camp back down to the Kain Hut to regain morale. The forecast for Aug 3 was again 40% chance of thunderstorms, and it looked the same or worse for the next week, so this was our last chance to climb the NE Ridge of Bugaboo Spire before returning home.<br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\nAnother alpine start left us at the base of the route just before sunrise, with clear skies and nice alpenglow. The dirty chute we took to the col was the crux climbing of the day, and we belayed one pitch. The route was fun and went quickly, taking us 5 hrs to climb the 10 official pitches. We chose to climb the north summit rather than take the bypass that most people do, and then descended the Kain Route, running into Allister, the hut caretaker, again!

Starting during the earliest glow of daylight, it was hard to see the chutes too distinctly, besides them looking mostly improbably, but possibly class 4 with some spooky sections. There were two options we could see, but as the snow had refrozen and we had left our crampons at camp, we opted for the chute with the lower entry. I suspect this was not the way to go. Rock was terribly loose, and the final 50 ft was very difficult, wet, and insecure climbing. We set up a marginal belay and were glad to have done so!

The crux is only a move or two until you get your feet over the little roof, and then it is very easy. However, I think I went off route higher up and made it more like 5.8+ to 5.9 as our topo made it look like I stayed in the crack system all the way to the ledges above. This way leads one through progressively thinning finger cracks with liebacking and stemming, and at the thinnest part, one must then traverse on thin 5.6-5.7 face moves to the right of the crack and up a body length above thin gear before reaching a rest stance! I believe one should actually climb the 5.6 chimney to the side of this and traverse over if they wanted to take the \'proper way\'.<br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\nAlthough apart from shrinking my ego a bit by getting worked more than expected on the pitch, my variation was plenty good to do.<br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\n<a href=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-P3csNNcPpTU/Uht6ig6CwlI/AAAAAAACeWg/cF8deA4CRYA/s1600/2013-08-03%252520-%252520017%252520-%252520Bugaboo%252520Spire%252520NE%252520Ridge%252520-%252520IMG_2329.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-P3csNNcPpTU/Uht6ig6CwlI/AAAAAAACeWg/cF8deA4CRYA/s800/2013-08-03%252520-%252520017%252520-%252520Bugaboo%252520Spire%252520NE%252520Ridge%252520-%252520IMG_2329.jpg\"></a><br>\r\r\n<b><i>Looking down from the top of the first pitch.

P9-P10</i></b><br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\nBefore we knew it, we were atop the route, and had the reportedly long traverse of the spire ridge ahead of us before we could begin descending. Clouds were starting to build, and Alec was getting a bit nervous, but I couldn\'t resist tagging the summit if we were so close! Things still looked OK anyways.<br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\nI think the topos are wrong on the next part, though, if you are doing anything more than traversing to the descent route.<br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\nFirst, the closer highpoint you come to is NOT the north summit. We climbed atop it, and it was obviously shorter than a summit farther along the ridge. I kept climbing back up to the ridge crest, and it seemed quite obvious to me that the northern high point is just barely across a gap from the south summit, and NOT on the northern edge of the spire ridge.<br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\nSecond, topos showed that to climb the north summit, instead of doing the short rappel to the cl. 4-5 ledge system that cuts across the eastern side of the spire, one should wrap around to the western side of the spire. DO NOT do this. This way is needlessly more difficult, doesn\'t take you anywhere that you can\'t reach from the \'bypass route\', and it is far less secure. Being on the windward side and rarely climbed, this whole section was covered in wet moss &amp; lichen.<br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\n<a href=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-Tf95qCvW9t8/Uht8aDu726I/AAAAAAACelo/zGTlX4ahM7U/s1600/2013-08-03%252520-%252520048%252520-%252520Bugaboo%252520Spire%252520NE%252520Ridge%252520-%252520IMG_2363.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-Tf95qCvW9t8/Uht8aDu726I/AAAAAAACelo/zGTlX4ahM7U/s800/2013-08-03%252520-%252520048%252520-%252520Bugaboo%252520Spire%252520NE%252520Ridge%252520-%252520IMG_2363.jpg\"></a><br>\r\r\n<b><i>Looking back on the wet mossy and gritty terrain as we traversed to the summit on the west side of the summit ridge.

It paled in comparison to the quality of the NE Ridge, but the position, exposure, and solid rock made it a fine alpine ridge scramble. Also, after experience many ridge traverses in the Sierra, I\'d say there is nothing special about this traverse being long or tricky, as far as ridge traverses go. The descent, however, is quite complex, and would be very difficult in the dark or bad weather if you hadn\'t climbed the Kain Route before. We hadn\'t, but we had good conditions by which to navigate, as well a the steady stream of climbers ascending that route.<br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\n<b><u>Descent down the South Ridge (Kain Route)</u></b><br>\r\r\n<a href=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-MpN8PjAyG-0/Undbswa-VYI/AAAAAAAC1S8/EdMGy9GfbIE/s1600/2013-07-30%2520-%2520053%2520-%2520Pigeon%2520Tower%2520-%2520IMG_2106%2520-%2520annotated.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-MpN8PjAyG-0/Undbswa-VYI/AAAAAAAC1S8/EdMGy9GfbIE/s800/2013-07-30%2520-%2520053%2520-%2520Pigeon%2520Tower%2520-%2520IMG_2106%2520-%2520annotated.jpg\"></a><br>\r\r\n<b><i>Bugaboo Spire\'s South Ridge (Kain Route) seen from the West Ridge of Pigeon Spire. (July 30, 2013)</i></b><br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\nFred Beckey lists this route as one of his \'100 Favorite\' climbs, and I would agree that it deserves more attention, and it gets far more trash talk of loose rock than it deserves. The lower section that is cl. 2 does have looser rock, but it is nothing bad compared to most alpine terrain out there. As you get higher on the ridge, the rock improves, and the spectacular views continue to get better and better. The upper third of the route is spectacularly exposed, which can be belayed or short-roped for comfort, but it is easy enough to do as a frightfully exposed scramble on solid rock. Some of the knife edges are incredibly narrow. The final crux roped pitch over the The Gendarme looks really fun as well. The color and texture of the rock on this other section was truly unique and memorable as well, and I liked it far more than the upper section of the NE Ridge.<br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\nIn a nutshell, the Kain Route is more of a highly exposed scrambling route with a few pitches of roped climbing at the top, rather than a sustained technical rock climb like the NE Ridge. However, this makes it a good introductory climb to the range, good to do to be familiar with the descent, and as the commitment only grows gradually as you get higher, it is a good climb to do on an unstable weather day.<br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\nUnfortunately, we used the rappels rather than downclimbing the entire route, so I can\'t consider myself having properly climbed the route. Next time I go back to the Bugs, I\'ll have this one short-listed to do as a second priority climb!<br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\n<a href=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-7x-rIgBwFAA/Uht9LJILfTI/AAAAAAACesQ/CCDXIMNxsbA/s1600/2013-08-03%252520-%252520060b%252520-%252520Bugaboo%252520Spire%252520NE%252520Ridge%252520-%252520IMG_0405%252520-%252520Alec.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-7x-rIgBwFAA/Uht9LJILfTI/AAAAAAACesQ/CCDXIMNxsbA/s800/2013-08-03%252520-%252520060b%252520-%252520Bugaboo%252520Spire%252520NE%252520Ridge%252520-%252520IMG_0405%252520-%252520Alec.jpg\"></a><br>\r\r\n<b><i>Me at the base of the first rappel down from the V-Notch.

Our plan was to set up camp at Applebee our first day (which had questionable weather), then the second day approach and set up a bivy near B-C.

Fortunately the terrain offered enough options for us to easily pass them. There was a large bottleneck of climbers at the final rappel, and while I didn\'t like the idea of downclimbing the tricky crux here, I didn\'t want to wait in line either. I spotted an OW/squeeze chimney crack below that would do just fine. For those familiar with wide climbing, usually the crux is moving up, but wide can be quite secure for plugging yourself in, and downclimbing by gradually releasing and letting gravity pull you down. This made for a quick and relaxed downclimb of the final step.<br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\n<a href=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-sZSJpcyJ7wE/Uht9W17DqNI/AAAAAAACet8/3m2Wfa8v17Q/s1600/2013-07-30%252520-%252520072%252520-%252520Pigeon%252520Tower%252520-%252520IMG_2126.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-sZSJpcyJ7wE/Uht9W17DqNI/AAAAAAACet8/3m2Wfa8v17Q/s800/2013-07-30%252520-%252520072%252520-%252520Pigeon%252520Tower%252520-%252520IMG_2126.jpg\"></a> <br>\r\r\n<b><i>Alec bypassing the gridlock at the second rappel station.</i></b> <br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\n<a href=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-fmVn9w5yxGk/Uht9cARbPrI/AAAAAAACeu4/C_lNd2n7kk4/s1600/2013-07-30%252520-%252520074%252520-%252520Pigeon%252520Tower%252520-%252520IMG_2128.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-fmVn9w5yxGk/Uht9cARbPrI/AAAAAAACeu4/C_lNd2n7kk4/s800/2013-07-30%252520-%252520074%252520-%252520Pigeon%252520Tower%252520-%252520IMG_2128.jpg\"></a> <br>\r\r\n<b><i>Climbers at the second optional rappel for the descent of the West Ridge of Pigeon Spire.</i></b> <br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\nThe climb only took us a leisurely 1.5 hours round trip and was well worth the detour. We had plenty of time to get out here, do the climb, and set up our bivy and get some rest before our main objective for the next day: the <a href=\"http://www.supertopo.com/tr/South-Howser-Tower-Beckey-Chouinard/t12222n.html\" target=\"_blank\">Beckey-Chouinard route on South Howser Tower</a>.<br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\n<div class=\"horizontalrule\"><hr></div>\r\n<div class=\"horizontalrule\"><hr></div>\r\n<br>\r\r\n<b><u>Notes:</u></b><br>\r\r\nWhile disappointing if you are looking for a technical climb, the West Ridge of Pigeon Spire is a mega-classic for its striking positions, spectacular photo-ops, and high quality granite. It falls somewhere in between being a scramble and a technical climb, so if you are proficient on this terrain, it is an easy solo (took us 1.5 hrs round trip), and if you are not, it can be done roped up.<br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\nPerhaps the ideal way if you are moderately proficient at trad is to rope up for a few short cruxes, then solo or simul-climb the rest, and possibly use the rappels on the descent. These sections are the first step, perhaps climbing out of the notch, downclimbing the first sub-summit, and the final pitch ascending from ledges around the summit block to the top.<br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\nAnother thing that makes this climb a great one to include on your Bugaboos list is that it can be a good rainy day climb - although you might want a rope in more places when the rock is wet. There are enough rainy days (or 40% POP) days in the Bugaboos that easier and shorter climbs are important to have on your list to still get out and about, get some exercise, and enjoy the range. The three most popular ones seem to be Marmolata, West Ridge of Pigeon Spire, and cragging routes on Crescent Tower or McTech Arete areas.  The South Ridge (Kain Route) of Bugaboo Spire also seems to be a good one in this respect, and can serve as a means of getting familiar with the descent if later planning on doing the NE Ridge - this descent would be very difficult to follow your first time if it is done in poor visibility (clouds, darkness).<br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\n<div class=\"horizontalrule\"><hr></div>\r\n<div class=\"horizontalrule\"><hr></div>\r\n<br>\r\r\n<b><u>Photo Album Links:</u></b><br>\r\r\n<a href=\"https://picasaweb.google.com/105894936663116565516/20130729BugaboosApproachWAlecLaLonde?authuser=0andfeat=directlink\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Picasa Album - Bugaboos Approach</a><br>\r\r\n<a href=\"https://picasaweb.google.com/105894936663116565516/20130730BugaboosPigeonSpireWAlecLaLonde?authuser=0andfeat=directlink\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Picasa Albumm - W Ridge of Pigeon Spire</a><br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\n<b><u>Other Bugs/BC Rock Climbing Trip Reports</u></b><br>\r\r\n<a href=\"http://www.supertopo.com/tr/South-Ridge-of-Gimli-Peak-A-Lesser-Known-Canadian-Classic/t12165n.html\" target=\"_blank\">South Ridge of Gimli Peak - A Lesser-Known Canadian Classic</a><br>\r\r\n-<br>\r\r\n<a href=\"http://www.supertopo.com/tr/South-Howser-Tower-Beckey-Chouinard/t12222n.html\" target=\"_blank\">South Howser Tower (Beckey-Chouinard)</a><br>\r\r\n<a href=\"http://www.supertopo.com/tripreport/tripreport.php?articleid=12246\" target=\"_blank\">Crescent Tower (Lion\'s Way) - A Great R&amp;R (Rain &amp; Relaxation) Climb</a><br>\r\r\n<a href=\"http://www.supertopo.com/tr/Bugaboo-Spire-NE-Ridge/t12224n.html\" target=\"_blank\">Bugaboo Spire (NE Ridge)</a>\r\n</div> \r\n'),(53,'t12246n','/tr/Crescent-Tower-Lions-Way-A-Great-R-R-Rain-Relaxation-Climb/t12246n.html','Crescent Tower (Lion\'s Way) - A Great R&R (Rain & Relaxation) Climb','content: <div class=\"articletext\">\r\n<div class=\"photonormal\">\r\n<table valign=\"top\" border=\"0\" width=\"476\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" class=\"sdw_box\">\r\n			<tr>\r\n			  <td><img src=\"/nav_img/top_left_sdw.gif\" width=\"13\" height=\"13\"></td>\r\n			  <td class=\"sdw_top\"></td>\r\n			  <td><img src=\"/nav_img/top_right_sdw.gif\" width=\"13\" height=\"13\"></td>\r\n			</tr>\r\n			<tr>\r\n			  <td class=\"sdw_left\"></td>\r\n			  <td class=\"sdw_body\" width=\"450\"><div>\r\n<a href=\"javascript:photoZoom(\'Oj46NzckJSYmJA,,\')\" title=\"Click to enlarge\"><img src=\"http://www.supertopo.com/photos/21/76/339117_5632_L.jpg\" width=\"450\" height=\"600\" name=\"\" alt=\"Katrina on a scenic rappel off of Central Crescent Tower.

Alec and I were game to follow as we had no information for the route. By chance Katrina, a solo traveler who was looking for climbing partners, bumped into us at camp. I invited her along so she, Alec and I climbed the route as a team of 3.

This route ranks among one of my all-time favorite 5.8 climbs. The face, while quite large and intimidating, holds a beauty of a route. The line seems improbable, but weaknesses link together just right to keep the climbing at a moderate grade. The climb also has two distinct characters: lower down the angle is shallower and the cracks are more flared, so it is more friction and face-like climbing at 5.7, but higher up, as the angle increases, the cracks split deeper and cleaner, so the climbing is mostly very nice 5.7 hand and fist jamming.<br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\n<a href=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-FXAM14sDhJ8/Uibc-nKHfbI/AAAAAAAC1Uo/it5tZyr71bc/s1600/2012-08-22%2520-%252016a%2520-%2520Pingora%2520NE%2520Face%2520Closeup%2520Panorama%2520-%2520annotated.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-FXAM14sDhJ8/Uibc-nKHfbI/AAAAAAAC1Uo/it5tZyr71bc/s1800/2012-08-22%2520-%252016a%2520-%2520Pingora%2520NE%2520Face%2520Closeup%2520Panorama%2520-%2520annotated.jpg\"></a> <br>\r\r\n<b><i>Pingora NE Face closeup of the upper part of the route.</i></b> <br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\n<a href=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-2fOFOorZMjc/UnnNLqdrYFI/AAAAAAAC1TY/vEnOM_67E38/s1600/2012-08-22%2520-%252013%2520-%2520Pingora%2520NE%2520Face%2520-%2520annotate.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-2fOFOorZMjc/UnnNLqdrYFI/AAAAAAAC1TY/vEnOM_67E38/s900/2012-08-22%2520-%252013%2520-%2520Pingora%2520NE%2520Face%2520-%2520annotate.jpg\"></a> <br>\r\r\n<b><i>Pingora NE Face</i></b> <br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\n<a href=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-pFOfc3rNsQA/UnnNG76ShLI/AAAAAAAC1TQ/r0qvoYBF64k/s1600/2012-08-22%2520-%252012%2520-%2520Pingora%2520NE%2520Face%2520-%2520annotate.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-pFOfc3rNsQA/UnnNG76ShLI/AAAAAAAC1TQ/r0qvoYBF64k/s800/2012-08-22%2520-%252012%2520-%2520Pingora%2520NE%2520Face%2520-%2520annotate.jpg\"></a> <br>\r\r\n<b><i>Pingora NE Face</i></b> <br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\n<b><u>2012-08-21</u></b><br>\r\r\nAfter linking the South Buttress of Pingora and Wolf\'s Head the day before, Thomas and I were eager for more of the great climbing that the Cirque held.

The North Buttress of Merriam has been on my \'must-do\' list for a while, and I easily convinced the others that it would be a perfect final alpine outing for Steph before she drove back to Seattle. It was just easy and short enough (III, 5.10b) for us to climb it as a team of 3. However, it is a ways in (about 9 miles, one way) and in a beautiful location, so we decided to break up the climb, with an easy approach day and camp by the Royce Lakes (where I tagged Spire Peak), and then doing the climb and hike out the following day. This would also make the outing easier on my knee, Steph\'s ankle, and Nic\'s lungs (he is at a disadvantage compared to us in terms of cardio and altitude effects). The climb wasn\'t as hard as expected (we all thought it felt like 5.9), but the rock was as great as rumored. This is definitely one of the best rock climbs in the High Sierra!<br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\n<a href=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-6RNSEwuBRX4/UjtnDlajWqI/AAAAAAACxAM/9IzwPAZB6mI/s1600/2013-09-10%252520-%252520013%252520-%252520Merriam%252520N%252520Buttress%252520-%252520DSC_0045%252520-%252520annotated.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-6RNSEwuBRX4/UjtnDlajWqI/AAAAAAACxAM/9IzwPAZB6mI/s800/2013-09-10%252520-%252520013%252520-%252520Merriam%252520N%252520Buttress%252520-%252520DSC_0045%252520-%252520annotated.jpg\"></a><br>\r\r\n<b><i>Merriam Peak seen from our campsite.</i></b><br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\n<a href=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-psInsbHqQIk/UjIBlR7pHFI/AAAAAAACzns/cgnkS3tBrzA/s1600/2013-09-11%252520-%252520146%252520-%252520Merriam%252520N%252520Buttress%252520-%252520IMG_3037%252520-%252520annotated.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-psInsbHqQIk/UjIBlR7pHFI/AAAAAAACzns/cgnkS3tBrzA/s800/2013-09-11%252520-%252520146%252520-%252520Merriam%252520N%252520Buttress%252520-%252520IMG_3037%252520-%252520annotated.jpg\"></a><br>\r\r\n<b><i>North Buttress of Merriam, with pitches according to SuperTopo.

I had been given the impression that this route was much harder and more sustained than it turned out being, which I didn\'t mind since that meant I could relax and enjoy it more. The rock, belays, and position make it a fabulous route. While the more focused rock climbers might not care for the route due to the ratio of miles hiked to pitches climbed, or how moderate it is,if you like hiking in and of itself, and just climbing through the mountains, this is a wonderful climb.I would rate this in my top 10 favorite trad climbs of the High Sierra.<br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\n<a href=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-q_n5_vzURiM/UjtnEjht0lI/AAAAAAACznk/F7rt36N0HvY/s1600/2013-09-10%252520-%252520013a%252520-%252520Merriam%252520N%252520Buttress%252520-%252520DSC_0045%252520-%252520annotated.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-q_n5_vzURiM/UjtnEjht0lI/AAAAAAACznk/F7rt36N0HvY/s800/2013-09-10%252520-%252520013a%252520-%252520Merriam%252520N%252520Buttress%252520-%252520DSC_0045%252520-%252520annotated.jpg\"></a><br>\r\r\n<b><i>Merriam Peak seen from our campsite.</i></b><br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\n<div class=\"horizontalrule\"><hr></div>\r\n<div class=\"horizontalrule\"><hr></div>\r\n<b><u>Notes:</u></b><br>\r\r\n<i><u>Topos and Rack:</u></i><br>\r\r\nAs far as topos, we brought along both the new SuperTopo topo and an annotated photo from MountainProject. We found the SuperTopo topo to not be very helpful, and down right confusing in some areas, which contributed to us getting briefly off route. This almost happened on several other occasions (it seeming to indicate going differently than one\'s intuiting would say) where we corrected ourselves by referring to the annotated photo. Hopefully my annotated photos are even better than the one on MountainProject, so I won\'t bother with a link to the one we used :-P<br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\nWe didn\'t bring anything special for the rack. 1 full set of cams to #3, with doubles in the #1, #2, #3 range, mostly for the Triple Cracks Pitch.<br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\n<i><u>Approaches:</u></i><br>\r\r\nWe took the Royce Pass rather than Pine Creek Pass. I have dayhiked Merriam and Royce on two separate occasions via Pine Creek Pass so it was interesting to compare the approaches.<br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\n<b>Royce Pass</b><br>\r\r\n+ Has significantly more cross country travel, including elevation gain on the cross-country travel. (Cross country travel is very easy, however, and boulder hopping only begins at the Royce Lakes.)<br>\r\r\n+Shorter distance<br>\r\r\n+ Cross country would be easy to navigate in the dark, especially with a map and compass (or GPS) to keep a general heading if the moon isn\'t out. Just take care to leave the trail at the right time, which isn\'t obvious in the dark.<br>\r\r\n+ You get far better views of the route on the approach. Arguably better views of Merriam and Royce too.<br>\r\r\n+ Much prettier campsites. Admittedly you can reach these from Pine Creek Pass, but they are a detour at that point.<br>\r\r\n+ Descent from Royce Pass is mostly on granite slabs, which I find far easier on the knees than even a good trail.<br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\n<b>Pine Creek Pass</b><br>\r\r\n+ More of the approach is on trail.<br>\r\r\n+ Longer distance<br>\r\r\n+ Cross country has very little boulder hopping, mostly near the route, but some cliff bands near Pine Creek Pass could make that section tricky to navigate in the dark.<br>\r\r\n+ Possibly a better option for a car-to-car?<br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\nOverall I think I liked the Royce Pass approach better. It felt more \'alpine\' had less signs of human travel, and was far more aesthetic, although Pine Creek Pass is beautiful as well!<br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\n<i><u>Times:</u></i><br>\r\r\nFor those curious about times: <br>\r\r\n+ Approach via Royce Pass (backpacking): ~4 hrs<br>\r\r\n+ Approach to climb from camp at Royce Pass: ~1 hr<br>\r\r\n+ Time to climb (team of 3): ~7 hrs<br>\r\r\n+ Summit to camp at Royce Pass: ~1:15<br>\r\r\n+ Hike out via Royce Pass (backpacking): ~4 hrs<br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\n<i><u>Other Things to Do:</u></i><br>\r\r\nA final note for any visit to the area, is that Merriam has a nice cl. 4 scramble up the chutes to the east, so if you want a shorter route to do, say on an approach day, I highly recommend this option. Other peaks in the area can be pretty, but they will be mostly cl. 2 boulder hops.<br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\nDon\'t forget that Peter Croft recently put up a reportedly high quality 5.11 right next to the N Buttress route as well!<br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\n<div class=\"horizontalrule\"><hr></div>\r\n<div class=\"horizontalrule\"><hr></div>\r\n<b><u>Links:</u></b><br>\r\r\n<a href=\"https://picasaweb.google.com/105894936663116565516/20130910to11MerriamPeakViaNButtressWStephNic?authuser=0andfeat=directlink\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Picasa Album</a><br>\r\r\n<a href=\"http://www.stephabegg.com/home/tripreports/california/merriam\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Steph Abegg\'s Trip Report</a><br>\r\r\n\r\n</div> \r\n'),(57,'t12258n','/tr/Bear-Creek-Spire-E-Ridge-An-Overlooked-Sierra-Classic/t12258n.html','Bear Creek Spire (E Ridge) - An Overlooked Sierra Classic!','content: <div class=\"articletext\">\r\n<div class=\"photonormal\">\r\n<table valign=\"top\" border=\"0\" width=\"626\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" class=\"sdw_box\">\r\n			<tr>\r\n			  <td><img src=\"/nav_img/top_left_sdw.gif\" width=\"13\" height=\"13\"></td>\r\n			  <td class=\"sdw_top\"></td>\r\n			  <td><img src=\"/nav_img/top_right_sdw.gif\" width=\"13\" height=\"13\"></td>\r\n			</tr>\r\n			<tr>\r\n			  <td class=\"sdw_left\"></td>\r\n			  <td class=\"sdw_body\" width=\"600\"><div>\r\n<a href=\"javascript:photoZoom(\'Oj40OTYkJyUkIg,,\')\" title=\"Click to enlarge\"><img src=\"http://www.supertopo.com/photos/22/24/343943_24085_L.jpg\" width=\"600\" height=\"450\" name=\"\" alt=\"Nearing the big notch, where we couldn\'t resist cutting right again, b...\"></a><span class=\"small\"><br>Nearing the big notch, where we couldn\'t resist cutting right again, but could have had more fun staying on the crest.

There was so much that added to its intrigue and appeal, yet there was very little information around and no one seems to climb it even though it is a \'Sierra 100 Classic\' and is right next to two other popular rock climbs of the Sierra (The N and NE Ridges). One can\'t help but notice this ridge when first seeing Bear Creek Spire. In profile it is quite the impressive sight, a long, sheer ridge, covered in dikes and capped by towers and gendarmes of many sizes. <br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\nSecor called the route IV, 5.8, A0, 22 pitches, but only had one vague paragraph describing the entire ridge. Talking with Michelle Peot I learned that the aid wasn\'t necessary, and that most of the ridge is moderate, so the 22 pitches length was likely conservative and without much soloing or simul-climbing accounted for. Still, I had trouble finding people interested in checking it out. The lack of certainty of a rack, topo, time to climb, or star quality rating  turned a lot of people off to the idea.<br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\n<a href=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-soVXmnXaFgM/UvQtGkL034I/AAAAAAADcrw/4MRJG6n92NY/s2000/IMG_3570%2520-%2520annotated.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-soVXmnXaFgM/UvQtGkL034I/AAAAAAADcrw/4MRJG6n92NY/s600/IMG_3570%2520-%2520annotated.jpg\"></a> <br>\r\r\n<b><i>If it\'s on a beer can, you gotta climb it!

We had great energy and momentum, and we weren\'t that far behind schedule! I stopped to take some photos of the beautiful alpenglow, and Scott offered to run ahead and meet me at the col, a short distance above.  He was a little too excited to run up the icy slabs, though, and held too firm of a grasp on his trekking poles. His experimentation with a new form of \'face climbing\' led to a broken nose, realigning of said broken nose, and a trip to Mammoth for breakfast and an ER visit (breakfast came first). Unfortunately there was nothing more to do this time around but to drive home and heal.

By October the weather was stable, conditions good, and Nic and I were positioned and well rested for the climb. The only downsides were the colder temperatures and shorter days.

The route has fun chimneys, tricky ridgeline climbing, and is about 2,200 ft long! We soloed the first pitch, belayed 2 other pitches, and simul-climbed the rest in a few mega-pitches. Most of the changeovers (or nearly so) were higher up on the \"Picket Fence\" type climbing, where even 30m was too much rope to have out.

There was one squeeze chimney section where we had to trail packs, and Nic got his stuck. He tried to just climb through it, and the pack strap broke! Sometimes some finesses needs to be mixed in to that brutish chimney climbing . . . I soloed down to retrieve the pack while Nic burnt off steam, and after climbing through the last corner (crux) we reworked a strategy in the sun. Nic\'s pack would be combined with mine, which he got to carry, and I carried the hood of my pack, with my day supplies, strapped on like a fanny pack.<br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\nThe next section of the route traversed cl. 2-3 ledges behind the lower towers, then steepened into real 5th class climbing that was quite interesting. The best way I could find to do this pitch was to face climb up a tower, then climb in to a chimney to tunnel through to the other side of the ridge crest, where I could step into and ascend a loose gully (5.7ish?) that led to another chimney, split in 3 voids by a leaning block.<br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\n<a href=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-oCHyz4QbXd4/UlOsfYuUm1I/AAAAAAACzxU/l5DowvNqY5M/s2000/2013-10-06%252520-%252520014%252520-%252520Bear%252520Creek%252520Spire%252520E%252520Ridge%252520-%252520IMG_3295.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-oCHyz4QbXd4/UlOsfYuUm1I/AAAAAAACzxU/l5DowvNqY5M/s800/2013-10-06%252520-%252520014%252520-%252520Bear%252520Creek%252520Spire%252520E%252520Ridge%252520-%252520IMG_3295.jpg\"></a> <br>\r\r\n<b><i>Reaching the first belayed pitch, which climbs the tower on the right and threads into and up the chimney, and into a narrow gully behind.</i></b> <br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\n<a href=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-ezpIpsS_HSU/UlOsivDs5DI/AAAAAAACzxc/Oh-7-8BQqa8/s2000/2013-10-06%252520-%252520015%252520-%252520Bear%252520Creek%252520Spire%252520E%252520Ridge%252520-%252520IMG_3296.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-ezpIpsS_HSU/UlOsivDs5DI/AAAAAAACzxc/Oh-7-8BQqa8/s800/2013-10-06%252520-%252520015%252520-%252520Bear%252520Creek%252520Spire%252520E%252520Ridge%252520-%252520IMG_3296.jpg\"></a> <br>\r\r\n<b><i>Looking down the tower.</i></b> <br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\n<a href=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-z5mAhXhdrF4/UlOslZcf-CI/AAAAAAACzxk/P63LhQE09SA/s2000/2013-10-06%252520-%252520016%252520-%252520Bear%252520Creek%252520Spire%252520E%252520Ridge%252520-%252520IMG_3298.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-z5mAhXhdrF4/UlOslZcf-CI/AAAAAAACzxk/P63LhQE09SA/s800/2013-10-06%252520-%252520016%252520-%252520Bear%252520Creek%252520Spire%252520E%252520Ridge%252520-%252520IMG_3298.jpg\"></a> <br>\r\r\n<b><i>Threading the chimney.</i></b> <br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\n<a href=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-5WleRa2CFWw/UlOspEL9tTI/AAAAAAACzxs/xBAHqPnnU3A/s2000/2013-10-06%252520-%252520017%252520-%252520Bear%252520Creek%252520Spire%252520E%252520Ridge%252520-%252520IMG_3297.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-5WleRa2CFWw/UlOspEL9tTI/AAAAAAACzxs/xBAHqPnnU3A/s800/2013-10-06%252520-%252520017%252520-%252520Bear%252520Creek%252520Spire%252520E%252520Ridge%252520-%252520IMG_3297.jpg\"></a> <br>\r\r\n<b><i>Threading the chimney, climbing above the chockstones inside to reach the gully.</i></b> <br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\n<a href=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-KKfL2lTKyYE/UlOstPPqwRI/AAAAAAACzx0/5DjGvce_Lvg/s2000/2013-10-06%252520-%252520018%252520-%252520Bear%252520Creek%252520Spire%252520E%252520Ridge%252520-%252520IMG_3299.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-KKfL2lTKyYE/UlOstPPqwRI/AAAAAAACzx0/5DjGvce_Lvg/s800/2013-10-06%252520-%252520018%252520-%252520Bear%252520Creek%252520Spire%252520E%252520Ridge%252520-%252520IMG_3299.jpg\"></a> <br>\r\r\n<b><i>After the gully, I climbed this second interesting chimney.

This led to a nice series of ramps that continued for a long time on the south side of the ridge crest, just below the crest.

It looked REALLY tough for 5.8, and there was an absurdly easy walk around to the side that appeared to go beside the headwall, after which we intended to pick out way back up and left. We did so, but found that this bypassed the lower fin . . . although even if we had gone right over the fin, we would have had a tricky time downclimbing into the significant notch that we encountered, rather than doing a gradual ascent into it.

We did see a couple of spots where climbers rappelled along the crest, and we had to do a tricky downclimb. On at least one spot, there was no pro that could be left for the follower . . . fortunately Nic likes spicy climbing, so this worked out well. If a weaker climber is following, they might not like a few of the downclimbs, which might make the rappels a better idea.<br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\nAlso, it was still extremely difficult to actually stay on the ridge crest. We rarely were on it for more than about 50 ft at a time before we had to traverse around an impasse or downclimb into a notch, so the traverse had lots of ups and downs and mostly did awkward, ascending traverses just below the crest, rather than being right on top. The climbing was fun, routefinding challenging, rock good, and we were close enough to the ridge crest to feel on route.<br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\n<a href=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-CT0GCHXtlb8/UlOuyax5hRI/AAAAAAACz2M/fCQ-IsHeapY/s2000/2013-10-06%252520-%252520055%252520-%252520Bear%252520Creek%252520Spire%252520E%252520Ridge%252520-%252520IMG_3336.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-CT0GCHXtlb8/UlOuyax5hRI/AAAAAAACz2M/fCQ-IsHeapY/s800/2013-10-06%252520-%252520055%252520-%252520Bear%252520Creek%252520Spire%252520E%252520Ridge%252520-%252520IMG_3336.jpg\"></a> <br>\r\r\n<b><i>Final ridge section to the summit.</i></b> <br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\n<a href=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-npH4VNp_rDA/UlOvAr9tQLI/AAAAAAACz2k/HhjksUYMHaQ/s2000/2013-10-06%252520-%252520058%252520-%252520Bear%252520Creek%252520Spire%252520E%252520Ridge%252520-%252520IMG_3339.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-npH4VNp_rDA/UlOvAr9tQLI/AAAAAAACz2k/HhjksUYMHaQ/s800/2013-10-06%252520-%252520058%252520-%252520Bear%252520Creek%252520Spire%252520E%252520Ridge%252520-%252520IMG_3339.jpg\"></a> <br>\r\r\n<b><i>Nic following the final part of the East Ridge as we neared the summit.</i></b> <br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\nIt\'s hard to really put a rating on the upper ridge, but it was enlightening to compare it to the summit block, which is a short 5.6R section that I used to find really intimidating.

I think it is a good idea to aim to be at the start of the NE Ridge by about sunrise. If you stay on the ridge crest better than us, expect an even longer day.<br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\nMuch of the climb could have been soloed if I knew better what lay ahead, but the continuous exposure and occasional loose rock seemed to make staying roped up a good idea for much of the route, even though most of it is low 5th. In light of that, no special rack was needed. I think we brought some doubles and cams to #3 Camalot. Nothing larger was needed, and more cams makes it nicer for longer simul-climbs, but we rarely did changeovers for lack of gear . . . usually it was to communicate, or drag became an issue and the rope needed adjustment.<br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\nWhile the rock isn\'t perfect throughout, and many pitches are mild, I still think this is a great route that has been overlooked. Frankly, I liked it better than the NE Ridge and N Ridge routes . . . it is far longer and is much more \'alpine\' in length, characteristic, and spirit.<br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\n<div class=\"horizontalrule\"><hr></div>\r\n<div class=\"horizontalrule\"><hr></div>\r\n<br>\r\r\n<b><u>Links:</u></b><br>\r\r\n<a href=\"https://picasaweb.google.com/105894936663116565516/20120623BearCreekSpireApproachAttempt?authuser=0andfeat=directlink\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Picasa Album - 2012-06-23 - Bear Creek Spire Approach Attempt</a> <br>\r\r\n<a href=\"https://picasaweb.google.com/105894936663116565516/20131006BearCreekSpireViaEastRidgeWithNicRisser?authuser=0andfeat=directlink\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Picasa Album - 2013-10-06 - Bear Creek Spire via East Ridge with Nic Risser</a><br>\r\r\n\r\n</div> \r\n'),(58,'t12262n','/tr/Cardinal-Pinnacle-Four-Great-Crack-Climbs/t12262n.html','Cardinal Pinnacle - Four Great Crack Climbs','content: <div class=\"articletext\">\r\n<div class=\"photonormal\">\r\n<table valign=\"top\" border=\"0\" width=\"626\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" class=\"sdw_box\">\r\n			<tr>\r\n			  <td><img src=\"/nav_img/top_left_sdw.gif\" width=\"13\" height=\"13\"></td>\r\n			  <td class=\"sdw_top\"></td>\r\n			  <td><img src=\"/nav_img/top_right_sdw.gif\" width=\"13\" height=\"13\"></td>\r\n			</tr>\r\n			<tr>\r\n			  <td class=\"sdw_left\"></td>\r\n			  <td class=\"sdw_body\" width=\"600\"><div>\r\n<a href=\"javascript:photoZoom(\'Oj89PjYiKSohJQ,,\')\" title=\"Click to enlarge\"><img src=\"http://www.supertopo.com/photos/22/32/344738_30989_L.jpg\" width=\"600\" height=\"450\" name=\"\" alt=\"Steph following the fun 5.8 &amp;#40;more like 5.5&amp;#41; corner on P2 of th...\"></a><span class=\"small\"><br>Steph following the fun 5.8 (more like 5.5) corner on P2 of the West Face.

Nic made it look easy, and as I followed it, I think it was actually easier and a bit shorter than the one on the Third Pillar.

Steph was a perfect partner for a wonderful climb! <br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\nWe were up early, on the route early, and got back to the car just as the afternoon rain and lightning started, but we were still able to take our time and enjoy the climb. We got GoPro footage of the entire route for video project fun and celebrated 2 Pi day on top in an unusual way. <br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\nThe climb felt surprisingly easy to me after the easier grade alpine climbing we had done throughout the week - perhaps due to better beta and immaculate granite?

I had already climbed the route with my friend Nic Risser, sleeping atop Big Sandy for my 30th BDay in August, so I also had photo documentation of the route.<br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\nI had no idea how I would do this, apart from knowing that I needed photo material to work with and would have to learn JavaScript to implement it. So on my last weekend out before my first of 3 knee surgeries, I hiked to the summit of North Dome with my camera and took a lot of closeup shots of Half Dome, and during my down time this winter, I figured out how to make this idea a reality.<br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\nThe project is still very much unfinished (and yes, Justin, I still need to add photos from your climb!), but it is working, and really fun as-is, and I see myself waiting too long before sharing it if I wait until it is \'finished\'.

There are a number of JavaScript methods &amp; plugins for  photo enlarging, but most did not allow some form of interactivity on the map that would scale and pan with the image.<br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\nI spent some time trying out one that could handle keeping image maps scaled and aligned with the image, but it was appearing to be a dead end.<br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\nSo I tried tiling, which handles the size and sizing issues. Using this system also allowed for using various interactive elements (icons, polylines, shapes), positioned by latitude  longitude coordinates, as this system is normally used for maps. Since my project was a flat image and not a curved 3D surface on Earth, I had to write some \'unproject\' methods in my scripts, but otherwise everything worked together smoothly.<br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\n<a href=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-OUfSmeGBKPs/U1MSJcBaZ4I/AAAAAAADd68/qHD2JIWWXiA/s2000/Tiling%2520Concept.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-OUfSmeGBKPs/U1MSJcBaZ4I/AAAAAAADd68/qHD2JIWWXiA/s800/Tiling%2520Concept.jpg\"></a><br>\r\r\n<b><i>I used Tiling to make to make the high resolution Half Dome image feasible for web viewing, with panning and zoom navigation. This is the same technique that Google Maps uses.</i></b><br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\nThe tiling was done using a free Ruby script that automates the process, taking a few seconds to size, crop, and save the files in a format &amp; folder structure that can be read by code for automatically re-assembling the portions of the image that are in view of your screen. There are various Ruby and Python scripts available to do such things, although figuring out how to get them to work is tedious (I really don\'t know either programming language).<br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\n<div class=\"horizontalrule\"><hr></div>And now, for those who just want to see some pretty pics . . .<br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\n<b><u>2013-10-20 - Solo Top Rope and North Dome Hike</u></b><br>\r\r\nThis was my last weekend to get out in the mountains before I would have the first of several knee surgeries that would keep me away from rigorous outdoor fun for the next year. As no one was game for getting out with me this weekend, I threw together my own last-minute plans for a Sunday daytrip: First, work out a system for solo top-roping at Knob Hill. Then hike to Indian Rock and Arch, and then to North Dome, for researching an approach and getting some project shots of surrounding features - especially the N Face of Half Dome.

In the summer of 2013 Steph Abegg and I had been planning on an ambitious extending climbing extravaganza. As she was coming down from Seattle, this style of trip suited her fine since it wasn\'t as local. We planned to do a number of classic, yet less famous, Sierra climbs, as well as a number of traverses. <br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\nRather than doing lots of hiking in and out, to add more fun to the adventure, we decided to do the entire trip as one long 10 day outing, doing climbs out from base camps that we would move as we went. Near the end of the trip, as our packs would be lighter, we would even do a carryover for part of the trip! Unfortunately bad weather got us to pull the plug sooner than expected, causing is to skip most of our northern objectives, but it was still a great outing, with many classic climbs, and an unusual way of camping and traveling across the Palisade Range.<br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\nIn planning, we dubbed out outing the \'Palisade Tangent Traverse\' because we would basically follow the line of the Palisade Traverse, parallel to the ridge, with climbs that would often take us up to and along the ridge for various sections.<br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\nSteph wrote an excellent trip report that is far more brief: <b><a href=\"http://www.stephabegg.com/home/tripreports/california/palisadetraverse2\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Steph\'s TR</a></b><br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\n<a href=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-0eY94QNe2SQ/UdSZw4eCl4I/AAAAAAACrUs/0nKteyZyMz0/s1600/2013-06-23%252520-%25252044a%252520-%252520Steph%252520atop%252520The%252520Orc%252520seen%252520from%252520atop%252520Strider.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-0eY94QNe2SQ/UdSZw4eCl4I/AAAAAAACrUs/0nKteyZyMz0/s800/2013-06-23%252520-%25252044a%252520-%252520Steph%252520atop%252520The%252520Orc%252520seen%252520from%252520atop%252520Strider.jpg\"></a> <br>\r\r\n<b><i>Steph atop \"The Orc\" seen from atop \"Strider\"</i></b><br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\nAs is my style, I took my time to write one, and I decided to indulge and share the experience in more detail.

He joined us on the hike to our high camp, and we had tentatively planned to climb the cl. 3 NE Face of Middle Palisade, but the heavy packs, late start (logistics took longer than expected), and early morning the next day had me and Steph decide against going beyond the high camp, so we just enjoyed the scenery, and Nick headed out after some nice relaxation.<br>\r\r\n <br>\r\r\n<a href=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-_SafTUXebcc/UdQ8A7e3Z9I/AAAAAAACZuQ/FPYUtKZFkac/s1600/2013-06-17%252520-%25252001%252520-%252520Food%252520Prep.JPG\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-_SafTUXebcc/UdQ8A7e3Z9I/AAAAAAACZuQ/FPYUtKZFkac/s800/2013-06-17%252520-%25252001%252520-%252520Food%252520Prep.jpg\"></a> <br>\r\r\n<b><i>Food Prep - 2 people for 10 days, at 2,700 calories per day.

I normally find myself eating less on climbing outings than at home, so I these days I usually pack less and plan to lose a little weight. However, as we would be out for so long, I decided I\'d best keep up with my calorie deficit. Steph normally eats 3,000 or so calories a day on climbs, so the food we brought was light in this respect. However, for me, in the end, I still carried much of it out.

Normally one would approach Scimitar Pass via a tedious but straightforward crosscountry bushwack passing by Elinore Lake, but when I looked at the stats for how much mileage and elevation we would have to do to drop down and head back up, I looked into a higher traverse option! Also, traveling this way, alongside the crest and staying above treeline, seemed like more fun.<br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\nI only had a few pixelated images taken to look at, but in general it looked possible to drop down the west side of Firebird Ridge. Based on winter photographs, there appeared to be a ledge system within a single rappel distance from the crest, that merged with the glacier. This proved to be the case.<br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\nThe day wasn\'t too long, but was plenty tiring! Our packs were still quite heavy, and we had 1,500 ft of gain with some class 3 scrambling, a tricky pack lower and rappel, loose rock ledge, snow downclimbing and long snow traverse and climb to drop down and reascend to camp. Still, it was faster and easier than descending the trail and coming back up by Elinore Lake!<br>\r\r\n  <br>\r\r\n<a href=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-eJgFej_PYSg/UdQ-5zbQpHI/AAAAAAADcJo/Rhx4fMAUttk/s1600/2013-06-22%252520-%25252000a%252520-%252520Cl%2525203%252520with%252520the%252520packs%252520-%252520Steph.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-eJgFej_PYSg/UdQ-5zbQpHI/AAAAAAADcJo/Rhx4fMAUttk/s800/2013-06-22%252520-%25252000a%252520-%252520Cl%2525203%252520with%252520the%252520packs%252520-%252520Steph.jpg\"></a> <br>\r\r\n<b><i>Scrambling up class 3 with the heavy packs.

We did locate a likely rappel point, so we got set up here. <br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\nOne unexpected detail was that our packs were heavy enough that it seemed like rappeling with them on would be a bad idea, as they would flip us over. So we had to lower them.<br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\nAnother unexpected issue was that the only rappel anchor that we could find that would take webbing required an exposed cl. 4 downclimb, and the best point to lower the packs, was above and beside this station. This point could be used with gear that I would clean and take with me on the rappel.<br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\nFinally, we unthinkingly packed one of our double ropes in a pack, and were too lazy to get it out. This second rope would have greatly simplified lowering 2 packs from a different location than the rappel station. Instead, we worked out an interesting arrangement that worked out in the end.<br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\n<div class=\"youtube\"><iframe width=\"560\" height=\"340\" src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/qvtq6-2wAUo\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe></div>\r\n<br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\n<a href=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-p92PdbpDZeo/UdQ-8fhdYXI/AAAAAAADcJ4/ZHSStbi61vI/s1600/2013-06-22%252520-%25252002a%252520-%252520The%252520rappel%252520%252526%252520pack%252520lower%252520-%252520Steph.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-p92PdbpDZeo/UdQ-8fhdYXI/AAAAAAADcJ4/ZHSStbi61vI/s800/2013-06-22%252520-%25252002a%252520-%252520The%252520rappel%252520%252526%252520pack%252520lower%252520-%252520Steph.jpg\"></a> <br>\r\r\n<b><i>The rappel and pack lower.

The views from this side are of a very different nature than those from Big Pine, and I really hoped that she could see this different aspect.<br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\nLuck was on our side this day, as once we were about halfway across Palisade Basin, the clouds began to lift enough to see the crest.

Climbing on cracks on the face to the right looked like 5.10 with marginal pro. A crack that split the crest above had a fixed nut in it, but I didn\'t see how one could get to that crack from either side of the crest at a 5.9 level. There was a blind corner to the left, and as I recalled from lower down, there might be a crack in it, although lower down it was a seam. <br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\nThe problem was that the last 10 ft or so leading up to it had no gear, and you had to step around an awkward bulge to get into the corner. I could barely feel around the corner, but I couldn\'t find the crack to tell if it would take gear. At the very least I would have to commit to a balancy step around that I could not reverse before I could get in any gear. Fortunately in the end this wasn\'t too hard, and the 5.9 finger crack after this was really fun and well protected.

Not only for the tat, but because it is the first reasonable way to start downclimbing from the crest after you pass Firebird Ridge.

This is NOT a route you will descend in the dark unless you already know it very well. It is also one that is serious enough and takes a good part of the day.

I found a better start that steps into it higher up. The crux was tougher than I expected - harder and less secure than anything on Firebird Ridge, so I would call this route either 5.9, or Firebird Ridge should be downgraded to 5.8 or 5.8+. I liked Firebird slightly more, although this one had more sustained climbing and exposure, but was much shorter and had a lot more loose rock. Still, you\'ve always got to appreciate a line that tops out directly on the summit!<br>\r\r\n <br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\n<b><u>Approach</u></b><br>\r\r\nThe approach went faster this day, naturally, as we were better acclimatized and knew the way more precisely. We did, however, find a way to make it to the col easier from our descent the day before, so we used that variation and saved some effort. That was by traversing closer towards Norman Clyde Peak to gain a narrow access ramp and then traverse back up and right. This replaced the first 100\' of cl. 3 scrambling with a mostly cl. 2 stroll. Steph was feeling fresher than me this day, so she ran ahead. I caught up to her napping by where we had left our gear from our climb yesterday, at the start of the large snowfield.<br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\nAs imposing as the snowfield looked from a distance, it is actually fairly mild. I imagine it depends on snow cover, but it seemed to me that if you fell on it, you might not sail off the lower cliff band. Still, an ice axe is mandatory and crampons recommended.<br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\n<a href=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-dZh0ODtgb_g/UdRm57xoLII/AAAAAAACoa4/vbZ0YQ5AuCU/s1600/2013-06-21%252520-%25252002%252520-%252520Crossing%252520the%252520snowfield%252520to%252520Twilight%252520Pillar.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-dZh0ODtgb_g/UdRm57xoLII/AAAAAAACoa4/vbZ0YQ5AuCU/s800/2013-06-21%252520-%25252002%252520-%252520Crossing%252520the%252520snowfield%252520to%252520Twilight%252520Pillar.jpg\"></a> <br>\r\r\n<b><i>Crossing the snowfield to Twilight Pillar</i></b><br>\r\r\n <br>\r\r\nAs we neared the end of the snowfield, we picked our way up to what looked like the best entry to the slabs approach scramble. From researching the route I gathered that this part was sketchy cl. 4 slab scrambling, and runout. I agree that there aren\'t many places for pro if you wanted to rope up, but the climbing wasn\'t too insecure, and had many rests and ways to go.

I wasted a lot of time climbing partway up and down this, deciding not to commit to the questionable, unprotectable strech that looked harder than 5.8. I considered the wide crack on the right, which seemed stout for 5.8 but was at least protectable, but I couldn\'t tell if I could get back into the dihedrals from that crack higher up.<br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\n<a href=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-KLM7Gz8JKuU/UdRnFGVoscI/AAAAAAACodk/gdOT8swZh1o/s1600/2013-06-21%252520-%25252009%252520-%252520Starting%252520P1.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-KLM7Gz8JKuU/UdRnFGVoscI/AAAAAAACodk/gdOT8swZh1o/s800/2013-06-21%252520-%25252009%252520-%252520Starting%252520P1.jpg\"></a> <br>\r\r\n<b><i>Starting P1.

Frankly, after traversing this ridge, I think the Thunderbolt-Sill traverse pales in comparison. This crest is far more varied, and it is far more sustained in difficulty, exposure, and commitment. I would say that the rock is also comparable if not better. <br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\nOne thing that makes the crest fun is how rarely it is traversed. When I first attempted a traverse in 2010, as far as register entries indicated, no one else had visited the summit for several years. Dating back to the beginning of the original register, the southern summit seemed to only see climbers once every 3-5 years, and few were attempting a traverse of the crest, and of those, most were attempting the full Palisade Traverse.  I\'m not too worried about highlighting this climb making it crowded. Since 2010, it has seen more traffic, but more like one signed ascent a year. It is tough enough of an approach compared to the other sexier peaks in the Palisades that I doubt it will ever be nearly as crowded unless access were dramatically improved. Not that it is all that hard to access, but just hard enough, and probably mostly spared a lot of traffic due to that phenomena of 90% of climbers crowding onto 10 % of the routes (see Temple Crag, Mt Sill, N Pal, etc.).<br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\n<a href=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-2n2-juWhB4A/UMzfeD1DTPI/AAAAAAABlCM/JyujDxquACI/s2000/PalisadeCrest-Aug6th-05-14GandalfPkLongShot2.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-2n2-juWhB4A/UMzfeD1DTPI/AAAAAAABlCM/JyujDxquACI/s400/PalisadeCrest-Aug6th-05-14GandalfPkLongShot2.jpg\"></a><br>\r\r\n<b><i>Michael Graupe climbing along the class 3 portion of the Palisade Crest. Gandalf Pk lies beyond.</i></b><br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\nI first saw the Palisade Crest on a <a href=\"http://www.markpthomas.com/mountaineering/trip-reports/california/mt-jepson-palisade-crest\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Sierra Challenge outing to climb Gandalf Peak in 2004</a>. However, I was too timid to cross the gap to reach the cl. 4 slab leading to the summit, so I turned around and bagged Jepson as a consolation prize. I figured if I were roped I\'d be OK, so that was a perfect excuse to come back and do the full traverse, where a rope is more required anyways. From this earlier outing I had seen that the crest was amazing, and I had gotten familiar with the standard approach, which is via a convoluted cross-country approach up the South Fork of Big Pine to Scimitar Pass, one of the most unlikely passes in the Sierra.<br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\nLastly, I want to point out that one of the things that made this climb so great was knowing so little about it, and the joy we experienced in working out the route, seeing it unfold, with the drama of uncertainty as to if we could find out way. We definitely had moments of doubt. So I was a bit torn as to whether I should deprive others of that experience by posting beta. However, I think the annotated images are so convoluted that if you merely browse them in a casual reading, you\'ll still be just as lost as we were up there, but plenty psyched to check it out! So don\'t worry about ruining a great mystery climb by reading this report. And for those who really want to follow every detail, they can take what they want with them and enjoy the route in a less mysterious way, but still plenty awesome.<br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\nOne mystery that still remains is the name of the summits. The northermost one is named Gandalf Peak after the wizard character in J.R. Tolkien\'s \'The Hobbit\', and the remaining 11 summits are supposed to be named after other characters from the novel. However, no specifics are given in any source, and Don Jenson, who first named these pinnacles, appears to have left no record either. I\'ll discuss this more at the end of the report. (Note: There are more than 12 summits, really. But for whatever reason, some were chosen as summits, and others not. At times we had trouble telling on the traverse whether or not a summit was one of the 12).<br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\n<a href=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-GlrNLKeyLBY/Tm-q5W8yPTI/AAAAAAAB0f4/hsYTP08UWcw/s1600/2010-08-09%252520-%25252003%252520-%252520Palisade%252520Crest%252520from%252520Elinore%252520Lake.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-GlrNLKeyLBY/Tm-q5W8yPTI/AAAAAAAB0f4/hsYTP08UWcw/s800/2010-08-09%252520-%25252003%252520-%252520Palisade%252520Crest%252520from%252520Elinore%252520Lake.jpg\"></a><br>\r\r\n<b><i>Palisade Crest and Scimitar Pass</i></b><br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\nFirst, a rant. Whenever I would speak of the Palisade Crest to others, trying to convince them that we should check it out, they would think that I meant the Thunderbolt-to-Sill Traverse, which the erroneously called the \'Palisade Traverse\'. When I would correct them, often the response is that the Palisade Traverse and Thunderbolt-To-Sill traverse are pretty much the same thing, and \'what is this Palisade Crest, then?\' Such misnaming has even become common in online resources.

We ascended the II 5.8 Southeastern Pinnacles Route and made it to the second of the 12 spires before we decided that we should bail due to clouds accumulating to the NW. And not a moment too soon! Next time I\'ll wear socks in my climbing shoes if snow and graupel/hail are a possibility.

As I was still fairly new to technical climbing, I went first on the simul-climb.<br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\n<a href=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-0Yk7QTwj-D4/Tm-qUpeHN0I/AAAAAAAB0cg/mYghbDDcdr4/s1600/2010-08-08%252520-%25252019b%252520-%252520Mark%252520leading%252520the%252520simul-climb%252520-%252520Dirk.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-0Yk7QTwj-D4/Tm-qUpeHN0I/AAAAAAAB0cg/mYghbDDcdr4/s800/2010-08-08%252520-%25252019b%252520-%252520Mark%252520leading%252520the%252520simul-climb%252520-%252520Dirk.jpg\"></a> <br>\r\r\n<b><i>Leading the simul-climb, trying to keep it easy!

Overall, I\'d give it about 2/5 stars, with the main drawback being the tricky and dirty first pitch getting to the notch. About halfway up the terrain got hard enough that we pitched it out the rest of the way to the summit. And what a summit it was!

Secor rated the ridge 5.6, with rappels, but looking ahead, it looked like it would be very difficult to keep the climbing at  5.6. Also, clouds were beginning to build to the NW and there had been a 30% chance of showers forecast for the day. The summit dropped away in a way that made it seem likely we would need to rappel, and be committed. We made the call to turn around.<br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\n<a href=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-uCRReZs2ES8/Tm-qtE22c2I/AAAAAAAB0es/RvY2ZuCc7Hw/s1600/2010-08-08%252520-%25252042%252520-%252520Dirk%252520looking%252520ahead.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-uCRReZs2ES8/Tm-qtE22c2I/AAAAAAAB0es/RvY2ZuCc7Hw/s800/2010-08-08%252520-%25252042%252520-%252520Dirk%252520looking%252520ahead.jpg\"></a> <br>\r\r\n<b><i>Dirk looking at the exposed rappel ahead as we consider turning around.</i></b><br>\r\r\n <br>\r\r\nAlthough it seemed like we turned around early, it took us a lot of time to reverse the ridge. As we neared the top of the SE Pinnacle route, the storm broke. Hail started falling, and we both started feeling an unnerving tickling of our hair vibrating up and down our arms and legs. Then ice axes started humming! There was a brief debate about whether to rappel off a side into the unknown and hopefully that would make us safer from a lightning strike. We decided this had enough downsides to racing to the beginning of our known rappel line that we should just go for it. The next decision was what was riskier: climbing as fast as possible to reach the rappels and get down before the imminent lightning strike, or recognize that the rock was exposed and getting slick from the hail, and hurrying would likely lead to a fatal fall (which would also occur if we were too slow and got struck by lightning.)<br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\n<a href=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-0c_tYC5nHM8/Tm-qvkXDDCI/AAAAAAAB0e4/Idukz7RQkSs/s1600/2010-08-08%252520-%25252045%252520-%252520Dirk%252520Retreating.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-0c_tYC5nHM8/Tm-qvkXDDCI/AAAAAAAB0e4/Idukz7RQkSs/s800/2010-08-08%252520-%25252045%252520-%252520Dirk%252520Retreating.jpg\"></a> <br>\r\r\n<b><i>Run away!</i></b><br>\r\r\n <br>\r\r\nWe unroped and Dirk chose to run, and I chose to take my chances climbing carefully. We met at the top of the rappels and down we went! The humming went away, but the wind and hail picked up.

Three years later the stars aligned for me and Steph Abegg to climb it together, albeit in some different ways.  We did a different approach to make it part of an <a href=\"http://www.supertopo.com/tr/Palisade-Tangent-Traverse/t12340n.html\" target=\"_blank\">extended backcountry linkup trip</a>, and we chose to attempt the crest N-to-S after I read about some PullHarder guys doing the Palisade Crest that direction. They said that they did some rappels, but that they were able to climb the crest that way at about 5.7-5.8 and though it one of the most enjoyable and tricky parts of the entire traverse. We decided to try this option as getting onto the Crest from Scimitar Pass would be much easier, with rappelling the SE Pinnacles route serving as our descent.<br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\n<a href=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-__HrsNsqAqw/U1QecaEtxcI/AAAAAAADd_U/xcLedkitWXU/s2000/2014-06-23%2520-%2520Map%2520Area.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-__HrsNsqAqw/U1QecaEtxcI/AAAAAAADd_U/xcLedkitWXU/s800/2014-06-23%2520-%2520Map%2520Area.jpg\"></a> <br>\r\r\n<b><i>Day 5, we spent a long day traversing the Palisade Crest.</i></b><br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\nThis is one of the most interesting routes I have ever done. Steph Abegg and I traversed the Palisade Crest North to South while managing to avoid doing any rappels, apart from the 5 to descend the SE Ridge in the dark to get off the Crest. It was a 20 hour day, with sustained and complex route finding, and while seemingly improbable, usually a passage could be found at cl. 4 to 5.6, with a couple of 5.7 to 5.8 cruxes, the most interesting of which was what we dubbed \'The Ivory Way\', a white dike ledge that passed through very exposed terrain. For most of the day we were blasted by frigid wind, from the west, which was from an incoming snowstorm and added to the alpine flavor of the route.

Apart from a couple of sections just south of Gandalf Peak, the route stayed sustained enough that we never unroped for the rest of the climb, although we only stopped to belay a few pitches.<br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\n<a href=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-guIB3ziytEc/UdSXktrGOUI/AAAAAAACrPM/NG0t0OASUPc/s1600/2013-06-23%252520-%25252005%252520-%252520Steph%252520atop%252520Palisade%252520Crest%252520Peak.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-guIB3ziytEc/UdSXktrGOUI/AAAAAAACrPM/NG0t0OASUPc/s800/2013-06-23%252520-%25252005%252520-%252520Steph%252520atop%252520Palisade%252520Crest%252520Peak.jpg\"></a> <br>\r\r\n<b><i>Steph atop Palisade Crest Peak, with Gandalf Peak beyond.</i></b><br>\r\r\n <br>\r\r\n<a href=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/--n5QI54YkV8/UdSXozAGeFI/AAAAAAACrP0/jnV1dN_-kW4/s1600/2013-06-23%252520-%25252009%252520-%252520Palisade%252520Crest%252520Peak%252520Register.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/--n5QI54YkV8/UdSXozAGeFI/AAAAAAACrP0/jnV1dN_-kW4/s800/2013-06-23%252520-%25252009%252520-%252520Palisade%252520Crest%252520Peak%252520Register.jpg\"></a> <br>\r\r\n<b><i>Palisade Crest Peak register</i></b><br>\r\r\n <br>\r\r\n<a href=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-DqGBJBdwpqI/UhbomPGbVVI/AAAAAAACdwE/R2s6VniYcRE/s1600/2013-06-23%252520-%25252010%252520-%252520Gandalf%252520Peak%252520-%252520annotated-2.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-DqGBJBdwpqI/UhbomPGbVVI/AAAAAAACdwE/R2s6VniYcRE/s800/2013-06-23%252520-%25252010%252520-%252520Gandalf%252520Peak%252520-%252520annotated-2.jpg\"></a> <br>\r\r\n<b><i>Gandalf Peak</i></b><br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\n<a href=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-isjKzZpJxJo/UdSXtfz1_II/AAAAAAACrQU/HOBq2mtnFvA/s1600/2013-06-23%252520-%25252012%252520-%252520Steph%252520downclimbing%252520to%252520the%252520notch.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-isjKzZpJxJo/UdSXtfz1_II/AAAAAAACrQU/HOBq2mtnFvA/s800/2013-06-23%252520-%25252012%252520-%252520Steph%252520downclimbing%252520to%252520the%252520notch.jpg\"></a> <br>\r\r\n<b><i>Steph downclimbing to the notch</i></b><br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\n<a href=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-7dApvppAzPE/UdSXvIGQM9I/AAAAAAACrQk/27qvcuHHZpI/s1600/2013-06-23%252520-%25252014%252520-%252520Cl%2525204%252520slab%252520leading%252520to%252520Gandalf%252520Pk.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-7dApvppAzPE/UdSXvIGQM9I/AAAAAAACrQk/27qvcuHHZpI/s800/2013-06-23%252520-%25252014%252520-%252520Cl%2525204%252520slab%252520leading%252520to%252520Gandalf%252520Pk.jpg\"></a> <br>\r\r\n<b><i>Class 4 slab leading to Gandalf Pk</i></b><br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\nThe cl. 4 slab wasn\'t too hard, but it sure would be heady to solo - especially on the mandatory downclimb if you are only climbing Gandalf Peak.

Often we would have to downclimb towards what appeared to be a dead end, and either a route presented itself, or it was truly a dead end and we would have to traverse around and over to the other side of the crest.

However, in each circumstance, we looked around a bit and found a way to downclimb instead of rappel. This was fun to piece together!<br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\nAt the route crux, the ridge ends in a sheer step, and I was forced to downclimb about 100 ft or so into some chutes on the east side. As I dropped lower from the crest, the rock quality deteriorated, getting worse as I got lower. Although it looked like I could traverse around the next spire on the east side, the rock was rotten, and the way was so far below the crest that it seemed against the spirit of the traverse. Also, it wasn\'t clear if it was a dead end or were we could next climb back up to the crest. So I trudged up a cl. 3 scree chute to a notch. The climbing looked stout ascending out of the notch, so I belayed Steph in and she put me on belay.<br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\n<a href=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-gcbNjWT5Ocw/UhbouJthU8I/AAAAAAACdwk/mcV6xBePxnE/s1600/2013-06-23%252520-%25252049%252520-%252520Looking%252520ahead%252520to%252520the%252520next%252520summit%252520-%252520annotated.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-gcbNjWT5Ocw/UhbouJthU8I/AAAAAAACdwk/mcV6xBePxnE/s800/2013-06-23%252520-%25252049%252520-%252520Looking%252520ahead%252520to%252520the%252520next%252520summit%252520-%252520annotated.jpg\"></a> <br>\r\r\n<b><i>Looking ahead to the next summit as we climbed through the crux section of the Palisade Crest.</i></b><br>\r\r\n <br>\r\r\nFrom the notch it was sustained 5.7 crack climbing up to another headwall. The obvious way from there was to climb into an OW, bit it looked tricky. Fortunately there was a crack beside it  . . . which turned out to be behind one of the larger and thinner flakes I have encountered. There would be no gear for the stout OW as any gear in the vibrating flake would clearly blow it apart, and a bad ledge fall waited 15 ft below. This didn\'t seem right. <br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\nI saw an exposed midget ledge leading out right to a corner ending in space. Perhaps there was a way around that corner? I awkwardly shuffled and hand-traversed over, but halfway along I encountered a 2\'x2\' block that seemed precariously perched. It would be difficult to climb past without risking a bad fall (I still had no gear in above the ledge) and I would likely dislodge it in the process. Or the rope might just knock it off after I climbed past. I knew that Steph was in a notch behind the last step, about 80 ft below, and the rock would clearly fall into chutes to the West, so there was no way it would strike her. Still, it seemed pretty large.<br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\nI called down to Steph and explained the situation. <br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\n\"Do you mind if I trundle this block?\" I asked.<br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\n\"Sure! Go ahead!\" Steph responded. So without too much effort I peeled the block off of the ledge and it fell free for about half a second before first impact, at which point it ricocheted down the chute, exploding many other chunks of rock and sending up a plume of gritty dust. The mortar impact was a lot larger and more impressive than I had expected! It also first impacted close to Steph\'s height, but around the corner. Still, she experienced enough of the blowback that she called out:<br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\n\"OK, that one was OK, but don\'t send down any more!\"<br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\nI had used up my trundling allowance for the day.<br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\n<a href=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-7sHMu557N6Q/UhbowNffE8I/AAAAAAACdws/Vu933RfcFZQ/s1600/2013-06-23%252520-%25252050%252520-%252520Looking%252520ahead%252520to%252520the%252520next%252520summit%252520-%252520annotated.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-7sHMu557N6Q/UhbowNffE8I/AAAAAAACdws/Vu933RfcFZQ/s800/2013-06-23%252520-%25252050%252520-%252520Looking%252520ahead%252520to%252520the%252520next%252520summit%252520-%252520annotated.jpg\"></a> <br>\r\r\n<b><i>Looking ahead to the next summit as we climbed through the crux section of the Palisade Crest.</i></b><br>\r\r\n <br>\r\r\nI made an awkward blind reach around the corner and found a hand crack.

I had <a href=\"http://www.markpthomas.com/mountaineering/trip-reports/california/mt-emerson-se-couloir\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">backed off on soloing this during the 2005 Sierra Challenge</a>, and so this time I brought a rope and light rack as backup. It turns out that for me at this point the solo was all right, so all that gear did was handicap me! After the headwall the route gets boring (not bad, but just scenic cardio terrain, reminiscent of a more solid Laurel Mountain SE Face), until near the top where it turns into a cl. 3-4 knife edge before the summit. Both Sean and I took other ridge variations to the side lower down to make the route more interesting. <br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\nOverall, the route is a nice scramble, but the descent is annoying enough that more traditional trad\'sters might not consider the climb worth it. I\'d rank it more as a 3/5 star route for the scrambler, 2/5 star for the trad\'ster (about the same for Laurel Mtn). I felt it was a nice way to spend a half day, though. I\'m not sure if I\'d call it a good introductory alpine climb for a trad leader, though, as the crux really doesn\'t seem to protect well, and after the first rope length, the rope is barely needed, if at all, although the route can provide good opportunities to practice simul-climbing.<br>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\n<a href=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-_zLthm0EI58/UlQtuxCTQ0I/AAAAAAACzaM/Y5XQGmZ-H1c/s1600/2013-08-25%252520-%252520035%252520-%252520Mt%252520Emerson%252520SE%252520Face%252520-%252520IMG_2704%252520-%252520annotated.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-_zLthm0EI58/UlQtuxCTQ0I/AAAAAAACzaM/Y5XQGmZ-H1c/s800/2013-08-25%252520-%252520035%252520-%252520Mt%252520Emerson%252520SE%252520Face%252520-%252520IMG_2704%252520-%252520annotated.jpg\"></a> <br>\r\r\n<b><i>The SE Face of Mt Emerson coming into view as we hiked back down the trail.
