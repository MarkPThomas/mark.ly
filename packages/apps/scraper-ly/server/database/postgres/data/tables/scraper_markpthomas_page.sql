It is a quantitative topic composed of facts, figures, and specs. How much does a piece of gear weigh? How strong is it? What is the range of protection? Etcetera, etcetera. Of course, then there are the less tangible aspects of different designs that are hard to compare. All of these considerations must be brought together when deciding strategically what gear we should purchase with our limited funds, or haul up with our practical limitations outside. \r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nAnd yet, all of these quantitative strategies must be brought to a far less quantifiable world. Equipment rarely breaks. It is usually the quality of the placement or the rock that fails. One rarely knows exactly what sizes are needed or how much redundancy they should have in their rack. For those that really care, there are many details to keep track of, and a lot of uncertainty.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nWhile I&acirc;&#128;&#153;m often pretty meticulous in planning for climbs, I have difficulty working with these stale, lifeless numbers. I need to give meaning to them - meaning that gear catalogues never seem to provide. So that is why I made the following figures for this article. Frankly, saying that a #3 Camalot or its equivalent should be brought to a climb means nothing to me. I need a way to make these numbers more intuitive and more tangible. \r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n</p>\r\n<h2>\r\n<a name=\"TOC-Relating-Yourself-to-the-Rock\"></a>Relating Yourself to the Rock</h2>\r\n<p>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nFirst off, a lot of the cracks you place pro in are also used for ascending the rock. In the simpler case to consider, you might be on a crack climb. The topo will call out the width of the crack, which as a number might be hard to fully understand, but it is very important information. It tells you both the type of gear needed to protect the section and also the type of climbing to expect. &Acirc;&nbsp;\r\n\r\n\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\r\nFigure 1 shows the various types of moves that work on a crack of a given size, based off of my own body measurements. Where there is overlap but one technique is probably preferred, I made the cutoff on the extreme end of the preferred technique. Later on I&acirc;&#128;&#153;ll also consider the larger sizes.\r\n\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n</p>\r\n<center>\r\n<table style=\"width:auto\">\r\n<tbody>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td><a href=\"http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/QXS_4YLmE2HvbgY20EdfWg?feat=embedwebsite\"><img src=\"http://lh5.ggpht.com/_or_7Q5ytcj4/TTpubM9SLJI/AAAAAAAAGWc/NU6Ga0_0rdQ/s640/%281%29-Trad%20Gear%20Specs%20-%20Body%20Ranges%20-%20Close.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\" width=\"800\"></a></td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td style=\"font-family:arial,sans-serif;font-size:18px;text-align:center\">\r\n<b>Figure 1</b> </td>\r\n</tr>\r\n</tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n</center>\r\n<p>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n</p>\r\n<h2>\r\n<a name=\"TOC-Relating-Gear-to-the-Rock\"></a>Relating Gear to the Rock</h2>\r\n<p>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nIn the following sections I look at active pro and passive pro. I&acirc;&#128;&#153;ve organized the charts by gear manufacturer, first showing the range &amp; distribution of ranges covered in the various sizes, and next by showing the weight of the gear in relation to the protection size covered.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nTo aid in comparing between manufacturers, in most of the charts I underlay the size &amp; weight distributions of Black Diamond gear as a common benchmark. I chose BD because it seems to be the most popular manufacturer and because they have the largest range of SLCD sizes available. The size charts should help you visualize the range distribution and overlap of a given piece of pro, and the amount of redundancy between cam models of the same manufacturer. The weight graphs can help in visualized what I&acirc;&#128;&#153;ll call &acirc;&#128;&#156;weight efficiency&acirc;&#128;&#157;, which relates the price paid in the weight of a piece of pro to achieve a given range of protection.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n</p>\r\n<h2>\r\n<a name=\"TOC-Active-Pro\"></a>Active Pro</h2>\r\n<p>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nIn this section I compare various types of active pro - mostly Spring Loaded Camming Units (SLCDs), but also Ball Nutz &amp; Big Bros. Ranges are those provided by the manufacturers and might not necessarily be those that are appropriate for the gear, which I discuss in the last section of the article. One benefit of using active pro versus passive pro is that the protection range is a continuum between the maximum and minimum sizes, so you can expect a piece of pro to protect anything within that size range that the rock geometry will allow based on how the pro works.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nFor those not familiar with SLCDs, some of the basic differences to consider are the number of camming heads, the number of stems in the cam, and whether or not the pivot points of the cam heads are aligned or offset. \r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nRegarding camming heads, the standard cams have 4 camming heads and the tri-cam units (TCUs) have have 3 camming heads, and therefore a narrower profile. Since TCUs have fewer heads, they exert higher stresses on the rocks since there is less bearing area to hold the cam in, but the narrower profile allows placements in narrower pockets or flares. \r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nA basic consideration for stems is that single stems have less material in the cam and are more flexible. This means that the stem bends better over edges and that the cam is less likely to walk (move) as the rope tugs on the pro. Double stems can be nice in that you can more easily pull the trigger to contract the cam heads for placement (try doing it with one finger on a single stem!).\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nMost cams have all of the camming heads rotate off of one axis, but for some specialized cams, and a prominent feature in Black Diamond&acirc;&#128;&#153;s cams, the cam heads on one side rotate around a different axle &amp; axis than the heads on the other side of the stem. This allows for a greater protection range for the cam and allows the cam to function safely as a chock/wedge/nut when the heads are fully extended.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n</p>\r\n<h3>\r\n<a name=\"TOC-Black-Diamond\"></a>Black Diamond</h3>\r\nFigure 2 shows the ranges for the various Black Diamond Camalot SLCDs. The C3s are tri-cam units. All Black Diamond SLCDs have single stems and offset cam axes. In general you can see that there is a lot of overlap in protection ranges between sizes. Also, the larger the cam size, the greater the protection range. The greatest overlap in ranges is biased towards the smaller protection sizes.\r\n<p>\r\n</p>\r\n<center>\r\n<table style=\"width:auto\">\r\n<tbody>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td><a href=\"http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/4Hy7bRoKzQmPFcSljPW49A?feat=embedwebsite\"><img src=\"http://lh4.ggpht.com/_or_7Q5ytcj4/TTpuKVWgrPI/AAAAAAAAGT0/DBC2O1SUqj8/s912/%283%29-Trad%20Gear%20Specs%20-%20Equipment%20Ranges%20-%20Black%20Diamond.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\" width=\"800\"></a></td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td style=\"font-family:arial,sans-serif;font-size:18px;text-align:center\">\r\n<b>Figure 2</b> </td>\r\n</tr>\r\n</tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n</center>\r\n<p>\r\nFigure 3 shows the weight efficiency for Black Diamond SLCDs.

The 3CU &amp; 4CU Cams are double-stem cams with the heads aligned on a single axis. The Dragon Cams have a single stem and the cam head axes are offset. As can be seen here, there is more redundancy in protection sizes between the 3CU and 4CUs, while in the Black Diamond cams the 3CUs protected to a smaller size overall and only redundant in the largest 3CU size. The effect of the offset cam head axes of the Dragon cams is apparent with the larger protection range, which is similar to the Black Diamond cams of the same size.\r\n<p>\r\n</p>\r\n<center>\r\n<table style=\"width:auto\">\r\n<tbody>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td><a href=\"http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/LbPSv8tyeqndfL7uaM6nnA?feat=embedwebsite\"><img src=\"http://lh3.ggpht.com/_or_7Q5ytcj4/TTpuLO6oflI/AAAAAAAAGT8/wHvz-9wLrOU/s912/%285%29-Trad%20Gear%20Specs%20-%20Equipment%20Ranges%20-%20DMM%20SLCDs.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\" width=\"800\"></a></td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td style=\"font-family:arial,sans-serif;font-size:18px;text-align:center\">\r\n<b>Figure 4</b> </td>\r\n</tr>\r\n</tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n</center>\r\n<p>\r\nFigure 5 shows the weight efficiency for DMM SLCDs.

Master Cams have a single stem and are identical to Power Cams in the protection ranges, although the 4 cam head arrangement is built to be narrower. The TCUs, Power Cams, and Super Cams have a double-stem build. Super Cams have a unique arrangement to give them a greater protection range &acirc;&#128;&#147; differently sized camming heads, with the smaller head rotating a full 180 degrees when fully contracted. The greater range provided by this is small on the smaller size, but larger in the larger sizes.\r\n<p>\r\nIn general, compared to the Black Diamond series, Metolius has more types of cams and less overlap of protection sizes between pieces &acirc;&#128;&#147; especially in the smaller range. There is also more redundancy between cam types, so you&acirc;&#128;&#153;re choosing one over the other more for other features than the protection range unless you are getting the expanded range of the Super Cams.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n</p>\r\n<center>\r\n<table style=\"width:auto\">\r\n<tbody>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td><a href=\"http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/IhlYnr3xTeko_2rPIUHG5g?feat=embedwebsite\"><img src=\"http://lh6.ggpht.com/_or_7Q5ytcj4/TTpuNr91VTI/AAAAAAAAGUk/wXJCDuCd1_w/s800/%287%29-Trad%20Gear%20Specs%20-%20Equipment%20Ranges%20-%20Metolius.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\" width=\"800\"></a></td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td style=\"font-family:arial,sans-serif;font-size:18px;text-align:center\">\r\n<b>Figure 6</b> </td>\r\n</tr>\r\n</tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n</center>\r\n<p>\r\nFigure 7 shows the weight efficiency for Metolius SLCDs.

Overall the main line of Metolius Cams is far lighter than the Black Diamond Cams. However, the Super Cams are significantly heavier than the C4s and overlapping protections sizes of the Power Cams.

The size range also includes smaller sizes, allowing an active protection option in cracks too small for TCUs, including parallel cracks that will not take nuts. Big Bros are specialized pro on the large end and cover the super wide ranges (and only manufactured by Trango), which is discussed in a later section.

So if you want a full set of expanded range cams, you&acirc;&#128;&#153;d better stock up on both. The Link Cams have much greater overlap in sizes than the Super Cams, and the relative increase in protection range provided is much greater.

One thing to consider about passive pro that does not come across in the graphs is that the protection sizes are more discrete, so a given size range is likely to only protect the largest and smallest size, and little in between. It is trickier to nail down exactly what the protection sizes actually are since it depends on which way the complex geometry of the pieces is used (I counted 7 discrete ways for hexcentrics, with some continuum protection possible in the 3 camming modes!). For simplicity here, I just show the size listed by the manufacturers, which mostly relates to the measurements of the geometry of the pro, such as width and depth for nuts.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n</p>\r\n<h3>\r\n<a name=\"TOC-Nuts-Ball-Nutz\"></a>Nuts &amp; Ball Nutz</h3>\r\nNuts can be divided into two categories: micro nuts (RPs) and regular nuts. Sometimes called wedges, chocks, and stoppers, these pieces work almost purely through wedging action in the rock. Micro stoppers tend to protect the smallest sizes and are usually made of a softer metal to encourage bonding/fusing with the rock surface to hold them into place (e.g. copper heads). They also have narrower profiles to make it easier to make placements in smaller cracks, though at the cost of less variation in protection sizes. Black Diamond&acirc;&#128;&#153;s MicroStoppers have more of a box shape to them that allows different types of placements. \r\n<p>\r\nAs seen in Figure 12, nuts are used as protection only in the very small sizes. There is also a lot more overlap in ranges as compared to SLCDs, probably as a result of the more discrete protection dimensions actually available in between the maximum &amp; minimum sizes. Note that the smallest 2 sizes are weak enough to be rated only for body weight and are not appropriate for lead falls. An interesting comparison here is that Ball Nutz active pro protect to sizes as thin as the narrowest nut, but theoretically they are all able to hold a lead climbing fall.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n</p>\r\n<center>\r\n<table style=\"width:auto\">\r\n<tbody>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td><a href=\"http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/s_euIi4yQ3NT-5knnP4XXw?feat=embedwebsite\"><img src=\"http://lh3.ggpht.com/_or_7Q5ytcj4/TTpuNKIc0DI/AAAAAAAAGUc/DfDm0YoupiY/s912/%2813%29-Trad%20Gear%20Specs%20-%20Equipment%20Ranges%20-%20Nuts.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\" width=\"800\"></a></td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td style=\"font-family:arial,sans-serif;font-size:18px;text-align:center\">\r\n<b>Figure 12</b> </td>\r\n</tr>\r\n</tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n</center>\r\n<p>\r\nFigure 13 shows the weight efficiency of the nuts. They are hands down much more efficient than any cam, which most of us climbers are well aware of. This nicely illustrates that weight efficiency isn&acirc;&#128;&#153;t the only criteria one should use for gear, since cams are so much more versatile and convenient to place. However, if you&acirc;&#128;&#153;re on a route where nuts work as well as cams, you&acirc;&#128;&#153;re better off leaving the smaller cams at home &acirc;&#128;&#147; especially on routes where weight matters such as aid climbing and alpine climbing. Surprisingly, the RPs don&acirc;&#128;&#153;t protect that much smaller of a size than the regular nuts, and aren&acirc;&#128;&#153;t any lighter.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n</p>\r\n<center>\r\n<table style=\"width:auto\">\r\n<tbody>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td><a href=\"http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/Bb-35aX5Y9J2lmcy3TUX-w?feat=embedwebsite\"><img src=\"http://lh5.ggpht.com/_or_7Q5ytcj4/TTpuRYJl8HI/AAAAAAAAGVM/oxeS9N6CEaY/s512/%2814%29-Trad%20Gear%20Specs%20-%20Weight%20-%20Closest%20-%20Nuts.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\" width=\"400\"></a></td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td style=\"font-family:arial,sans-serif;font-size:18px;text-align:center\">\r\n<b>Figure 13</b> </td>\r\n</tr>\r\n</tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n</center>\r\n<p>\r\n</p>\r\n<h3>\r\n<a name=\"TOC-Hexcentrics\"></a>Hexcentrics</h3>\r\nHexcentrics (usually just called hexes), can work both as nuts and as camming devices.

How wide is usable for a cam? For an easy comparison, I started with Metolius since they use a color-coded system on the cam heads to categorize the safety of cam size placements. Since they have some amount of liability in stating what is a good (green), adequate (yellow) and questionable (red) range, this is easy to measure with confidence that some thought and engineering considerations are behind the classifications. I also compared my other cams just considering the maximum geometry compared to the manufacturer&acirc;&#128;&#153;s stated range.\r\n<p>\r\nIn Figure 24 there are some interesting findings. For most of the cams, the stated maximum range is near the actual maximum geometry, so as a rule of thumb, remember that the range you see in the catalogues is not the actual range you&acirc;&#128;&#153;ll be using! Metolius cams are the exception, with the maximum range for the smaller cams being at about the transition between the adequate and questionable range. However, as the cams get larger, the stated range gets deeper into the questionable range &acirc;&#128;&#147; especially with the expanded range cams. Perhaps this is an indication of an advertising-influenced bias?\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n</p>\r\n<center>\r\n<table style=\"width:auto\">\r\n<tbody>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td><a href=\"http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/ALNlz29miGhSm8pO-u78Bw?feat=embedwebsite\"><img src=\"http://lh6.ggpht.com/_or_7Q5ytcj4/TTpumTcKCrI/AAAAAAAAGYM/Bfgmv3vytfQ/s912/%2826%29%20Trad%20Gear%20Specs%20-%20Equipment%20Range%20Useful%20vs%20Stated.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\" width=\"800\"></a></td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td style=\"font-family:arial,sans-serif;font-size:18px;text-align:center\">\r\n<b>Figure 24</b> </td>\r\n</tr>\r\n</tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n</center>\r\n<p>\r\nOne other size consideration to note is that I found the minimum stated size to be about the same as the dimension for a fully contracted cam, so you should also expect the smallest available placement from a cam to be a bit larger than that stated by any of the manufacturers if you&acirc;&#128;&#153;re taking care to avoid over-camming.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n</p>\r\n<h3>\r\n<a name=\"TOC-Types-of-Pro-Compared\"></a>Types of Pro Compared</h3>\r\nThe following are all of the types of pro considered in this article.\r\n<ul>\r\n<p>\r\n</p>\r\n<li>Passive Pro \r\n<ul>\r\n<li>\r\n<a href=\"http://www.blackdiamondequipment.com/en-us/shop/climb/protection/micro-stoppers\">Micro Nuts</a>\r\n</li>\r\n<li>\r\n<a href=\"http://www.blackdiamondequipment.com/en-us/shop/climb/protection/stoppers\">Nuts</a>\r\n</li>\r\n<li>\r\n<a href=\"http://www.blackdiamondequipment.com/en-us/shop/climb/protection/wired-hexentrics\">Hexes</a>\r\n</li>\r\n<li>\r\n<a href=\"http://www.camp-usa.com/products/climbing-protection/nylon-tricams.asp\">Tri-Cams</a>\r\n</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>\r\n</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li>Active Pro\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>\r\n<a href=\"http://www.trango.com/protection/BallNutz\">Ball Nutz</a>\r\n</li>\r\n<li>\r\n<a href=\"http://www.trango.com/protection/Big-Bros\">Big Bros</a>\r\n</li>\r\n<li>SLCDs\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Black Diamond\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>\r\n<a href=\"http://www.blackdiamondequipment.com/en-us/shop/climb/protection/camalot-c3\">Camalot C3</a>\r\n</li>\r\n<li>\r\n<a href=\"http://www.blackdiamondequipment.com/en-us/shop/climb/protection/camalottm\">Camalot C4</a>\r\n</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n</li>\r\n<li>DMM\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>\r\n<a href=\"http://www.dmmclimbing.com/productsDetails.asp?pid=4&amp;pid2=237\">3CU Cam</a>\r\n</li>\r\n<li>\r\n<a href=\"http://www.dmmclimbing.com/productsDetails.asp?pid=4&amp;pid2=93\">4CU Cam</a>\r\n</li>\r\n<li>\r\n<a href=\"http://www.dmmclimbing.com/productsDetails.asp?pid=4&amp;pid2=249\">Dragon Cam</a>\r\n</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n</li>\r\n<li>Metolius\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>\r\n<a href=\"http://www.metoliusclimbing.com/tcu.html\">TCU</a>\r\n</li>\r\n<li>\r\n<a href=\"http://www.metoliusclimbing.com/power_cam.html\">Power Cam</a>\r\n</li>\r\n<li>\r\n<a href=\"http://www.metoliusclimbing.com/master_cam.html\">Master Cam</a>\r\n</li>\r\n<li>\r\n<a href=\"http://www.metoliusclimbing.com/supercam.html\">Super Cam</a>\r\n</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n</li>\r\n<li>Trango\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>\r\n<a href=\"http://www.trango.com/protection/splitter_cams\">Splitter 4 Cams</a>\r\n</li>\r\n<li>\r\n<a href=\"http://www.trango.com/protection/flex-cams\">Flex Cams</a>\r\n</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n</li>\r\n<li>Omega Pacific\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>\r\n<a href=\"http://www.omegapac.com/op_products_linkcams.html\">Link Cams</a>\r\n</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<hr>\r\n<hr>\r\n<h2>\r\n<a name=\"TOC-Links\"></a>Links</h2>\r\n<ul><li>\r\n<a href=\"http://www.summitpost.org/size-matters-a-gear-comparison/694359\"></a><a href=\"http://www.summitpost.org/size-matters-a-gear-comparison/694359\">SummitPost Article</a>\r\n</li></ul>\r\n</div> \r\n'),(2,2,'/mountaineering/articles/glaciers','Glaciers','Glaciers','Article','content: &lt;div dir=\"ltr\"&gt;\r\n&lt;h1&gt;\r\n&lt;a name=\"TOC-Glaciers\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Glaciers&lt;/h1&gt;\r\n&lt;h2&gt;\r\n&lt;a name=\"TOC-Introduction\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Palisade Glacier in the fall (Palisades, Sierra Nevada, CA)&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;h3&gt;\r\n&lt;a name=\"TOC-What-is-a-Glacier-\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;What is a Glacier?&lt;/h3&gt;\r\n\r\nSay you&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;re climbing in the mountains in late fall and you come across a body of snow that has been there for the whole summer, if not for years. Is it a glacier? Maybe, maybe not. Even if it has metamorphosed into ice, it still may be a permanent snowfield. The critical feature that glaciers have is movement. The glacier may start out as a permanent snowfield or icefield, but eventually the weight of the ice becomes so great compared to the friction holding it in place that the body of ice moves downhill. At the same time, enough new snow is added to the glacier to constantly replenish the ice at the top of the glacier. \r\n&lt;p&gt;\r\nThe area of a glacier that retains snow year-round is called the accumulation zone, and as the ice compacts, it moves downhill to an elevation where more melting occurs on the surface and eventually the presence of ice is due solely to ice that has moved downhill rather than remaining from prior years. This area of the glacier that completely melts out is called the ablation zone. The dividing line between the accumulation zone and the ablation zone is the firn line, and in mid-latitude glaciers it is easily visible, as in the photo above, as the lingering snow stays whiter while the melted out ablation zone is left dark and dirty in late season. Can you spot these features on the Palisade Glacier, picture above?\r\n&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;\r\nIf the glacier is in equilibrium, the head and terminus of the glacier will remain stationary as the melt at the bottom matches the addition of ice at the top. Although the glacier may appear stationary, it is still moving and eroding. Glaciers recede or grow when the formation of ice at higher altitudes becomes out of balance with the melt of the glacier at lower altitudes. The movement of the firn line is an easy way to tell if a glacier is growing or shrinking. \r\n&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;\r\n&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;A diagram of what a glacier is and how it works.

However, if enough rocks fall onto the ice, the rock will act as an insulator of the ice against the heat, preserving the ice beneath. The glacier may look like just a flowing pile of rocks, but there may still be ice flowing underneath.\r\n\r\n\r\n&lt;h4&gt;\r\n&lt;a name=\"TOC-Hanging-Glaciers\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Hanging Glaciers&lt;/h4&gt;\r\nHanging glaciers are glaciers that do not melt out at the bottom. Instead, the glacier plunges off of a cliff. The terminus is an icefall of seracs. These glaciers appear to be hanging on the mountainside, and it is generally a good idea not to linger below them, as they are always dropping massive chunks of ice off the cliff, creating devastating ice avalanches.&lt;div&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;&amp;Acirc;&amp;nbsp;\r\n\r\n\r\n&lt;h3&gt;\r\n&lt;a name=\"TOC-Miscellaneous-Glacier-Features\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Miscellaneous Glacier Features&lt;/h3&gt;\r\n&lt;h4&gt;\r\n&lt;a name=\"TOC-Moulins\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Moulins&lt;/h4&gt;\r\nMoulins are holes in the glacier burrowed by flowing water. During the summer months when there is a lot of melting, water may pour down the surface of a glacier like a river. If this water hits a small crevasse, the water will erode the ice and burrow down, sometimes to the bedrock, creating a subterranean river. \r\n&lt;p&gt;\r\nMoulins are very hazardous as if you fall into meltwater on a glacier, you may be swept into one of these and into the depths of the glacier and you will probably drown. They are found in ablation zones and usually form or open up in the later season when a lot of melting is occurring.\r\n&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;\r\n&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;A river forms on the surface of the Athabasca Glacier during intensive summer melting (left),  disappearing into a moulin formed in the longitudinal crevasse near the glacier terminus (right). (Icefield Parkway, Canadian Rockies, Alberta, Canada)&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Dinwoody Glacier. You can clearly see the bergshrunds lining the tops of the glaciers. The white snow is the accumulation zone, and the darker ablation zone can be seen in the lower left corner. Also note the melt channels, which are a sign of snow stability, but also potentially weaker snow bridges (Wind River Range, WY) &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;h4&gt;\r\n&lt;a name=\"TOC-Bergschrunds\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Bergschrunds&lt;/h4&gt;\r\nBergschrunds are the gaps formed by the separation of the moving glacier and any stationary ground above, which is usually a permanent snowfield or ice couloirs. They can be very wide and broad, but generally aren&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;t as deep as crevasses as they tend to fill with debris falling down from above the glacier. Bergschrunds provide major barriers to exiting a glacier or entering a couloir as once snow bridges melt out, they can form continuous vertical or overhanging walls of ice.\r\n&lt;p&gt;\r\n&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Bergshcrunds often make it difficult to exit a glacier (Middle Palisade Glacier, Sierra Nevada, CA)&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;h4&gt;\r\n&lt;a name=\"TOC-Moats\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Moats&lt;/h4&gt;\r\nBecause the darker rocks along the edge of glaciers absorb heat from sunlight, they tend to melt away the snow and ice adjacent to it. Although moats can be tens of feet deep and wide, they are generally smaller than crevasses. Still, they can pose barriers to entering or exiting a glacier, similar to bergschrunds.&lt;/div&gt;\r\n&lt;div&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;h2&gt;\r\n&lt;a name=\"TOC-Glacial-Erosion\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Glacial Erosion&lt;/h2&gt;\r\n&lt;h3&gt;\r\n&lt;a name=\"TOC-Plucking-Grinding\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Plucking &amp;amp; Grinding&lt;/h3&gt;\r\nA glacier erodes through two processes &amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#147; plucking and grinding. Grinding occurs as the ice abrades rock and wears it down. Rock worn by a glacier is easily identified by the smooth glacial polish left behind from this. Contrary to popular conception, this is not the main mechanism of glacial erosion, as rocks such as granite abrade too slowly to account for the deep U-shaped valleys carved by glaciers.\r\n&lt;p&gt;\r\nPlucking is the main erosion mechanism of glaciers. All rocks have some cracks in them (also called joints). These are formed by the presence of tension. In granite and other metamorphic rocks, joints often form from the contraction of the rock as it cooled. These joints are weaknesses in the rock, and glacial ice tends to catch the edges of joints and &amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#152;pluck&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153; out shards of rock, peeling back the rock layer by layer. \r\n&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;\r\nBecause of this, heavily jointed rock wears down much more quickly and dramatically than rock free of joints. This is also why although the bottoms of glacially carved valleys are smooth and rounded, the sides and headwalls of such valleys are usually very steep and often left as a continuous line of cliffs.  This is also why glacially carved canyons often have fairly flat bottoms interrupted by a series of distinct headwalls, called cirques. Parallel glacially carved valleys tend to leave knife-edge ridges with very steep rock faces on both sides. These ridges are called ar&amp;Atilde;&amp;ordf;tes.\r\n&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;\r\nAlternatively, valleys eroded by water are V-shaped and twist and turn as water is deflected by various types of rock. The large mass and inertia of glaciers create straight valleys as glaciers usually ride up and over, or spill around any obstacles that aren&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;t flattened by the glacier.\r\n&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;\r\n&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Glacial erosion through grinding and plucking.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;h3&gt;\r\n&lt;a name=\"TOC-Remnants-of-Glacial-Erosion\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Remnants of Glacial Erosion&lt;/h3&gt;\r\n&lt;h4&gt;\r\n&lt;a name=\"TOC-Glacial-Till\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Glacial Till&lt;/h4&gt;\r\nGlacial till is the soil eroded from glaciers. Usually this till colors water, leaving runoff close to the glacier a milky white color. Depending on the type of rock eroded, this can have dramatic coloring effects further downstream, creating lakes and rivers that are unreal shades of blue, green, and turquoise.\r\n&lt;p&gt;\r\nGlacial till also makes water gathered from the toe of the glacier undesirable for dinking as it is essentially muddy water. It also is hard on water filters.\r\n&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;\r\n&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Lake MacArthur and Mt Biddle.

In general there are three types of moraines &amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#147; terminal, lateral, and medial. Terminal moraines mark the toe or terminus of the glacier, forming across the width of the glacier. Lateral moraines form alongside the glacier as debris is pushed out from the side of the glacier or from debris that falls onto the edge of the glacier as the glacier undercuts neighboring cliffs. As the debris piles up, it protects the snow beneath from melting, causing these sides of the glacier to remain higher than the center. Medial moraines form when two glaciers flow together, trapping lateral moraines between them. \r\n&lt;p&gt;\r\nOnce a glacier melts away, moraines are often the only clue of glaciation. Often the terminal and lateral moraines trap water in the valley carved by the glacier, forming a lake where the toe of the glacier once stood. This is how many of the natural lakes and ancient moraines at the mouths of the canyons in the eastern Sierra formed.\r\n&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;\r\nGlaciers are always growing and receding, so there are often multiple terminal moraines as the glacier pushes one up, recedes, and then pushes up another. Meltwater from the glacier tends to pile up behind these moraines, forming lakes at the toe of the glacier, called tarns. If a glacier recedes slowly enough, it may do this in many locations along it&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;s track, leaving behind a string of lakes, such as the &amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#156;Numbered&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#157; lakes in the North Fork of Big Pine in the Palisades region of the High Sierra.\r\n&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;\r\nBecause moraines are formed by eroded rock and mud pushed up into mounds, they are composed of rotten, friable rock and are very unstable. Not only are they formed in an unstable way, but moraines by existing glaciers are still being pushed. Climbing on moraines is unpleasant and can be dangerous due to falling rock. Take care whenever climbing on moraines and strategize ahead of time to take the line of lowest steepness as the moraine is more stable in these areas.\r\n&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;\r\nOn some large moraines, enough mud and soil can collect on top to support plant life, such as on the toe of the Ruth Glacier. These moraines essentially become moving meadows and forests!\r\n&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;\r\n&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;A prominent medial moraine on the Ruth Glacier. You can see lateral moraines on the side. Also note how many of the crevasses are filled with melt water as this was taken in June. (Ruth Gorge, Alaska Range, AK)&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;h4&gt;\r\n&lt;a name=\"TOC-Cleavers-Nunataks-and-Roche-Moutonnees\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Cleavers, Nunataks, and Roche Moutonnees&lt;/h4&gt;\r\nA cleaver is a ridgeline of rock that remains sticking up between various flows of a glacier, like a fin. They can provide means of climbing through a glacier that has heavy crevassing or an icefall. The easiest and most popular route on Mt Rainier, Disappointment Cleaver, ascends a cleaver to pass between the icefalls of two neighboring glaciers to reach the summit. \r\n&lt;p&gt;\r\nA nunatak is an exposed rocky element of a ridge, mountain, or peak that protrudes above the ice of a glacier or icefield. A number of the peaks in the Sierra Nevada are ancient nunataks.\r\n&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;\r\nRoche moutonnee is a rock or hill sculpted by glacial ice flowing over the top. Usually the uphill side is scoured smooth by the grinding action of the ice, but the downhill side has a steep, fractured face that is left from glacial plucking.  Many of the domes in Tuolumne Meadows in Yosemite National Park are actually remnants of ancient roche moutonees.\r\n&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Lembert Dome is a Roche Moutonnee. The glacier flowed from right to left (Tuolumne Meadows, Sierra Nevada, CA)&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;h2&gt;\r\n&lt;a name=\"TOC-Glacial-Kinematics\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Glacial Kinematics&lt;/h2&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;\r\nIn this section I will talk briefly about the behavior of glacial ice and how it affects the form of a glacier.\r\n&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;\r\n&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;h4&gt;\r\n&lt;a name=\"TOC-Creep-and-Glide\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Creep and Glide&lt;/h4&gt;\r\nGlaciers move by a combination of glide and creep. Because ice is plastic when deformed slowly and under pressure, the glacial ice flows downhill like a slow river of ice. Creep is this movement by deformation. Glide is a rigid-body motion of the glacier as it slides down on a bed surface, usually lubricated by meltwater that flows between the bedrock and the underside of the glacier. Creep is what causes plucking, and glide is what causes grinding in glacial erosion.\r\n&lt;p&gt;\r\nIn general glaciers move faster in the summer, both because the greater melting accelerates glide, and also the warming of the ice make it flow easier, accelerating creep. As such, icefall activity tends to increase during the summer months if it has any variation over the year. Because heat accelerates glacier motion, mid-latitude glaciers can move very fast, reach 1-3 ft of movement per day!\r\n&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;\r\n&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;h4&gt;\r\n&lt;a name=\"TOC-Kinematic-Waves\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Kinematic Waves&lt;/h4&gt;\r\nBecause glacial ice flows, it has many characteristics of a liquid. One is the formation of kinematic waves. These waves are essentially slow-motion shockwaves in the ice that form from very heavy snow years and take years to propagate down the length of the glacier. The increase in load from the extra snow pushes the glacier down harder. When this snow melts or consolidates into the glacier, the glacier springs back up again. \r\n&lt;p&gt;\r\nThis up and down motion travels down the glacier at a slow pace, but the size of the wave can be quite noticeable. The waves can reach 80 ft in height and move down the glacier faster than the flow of the ice itself, causing the terminus of the glacier to advance dramatically when it reaches the end. Keep in mind that these waves tend to accelerate the ice, which affects seracs and crevasses. At the front of the wave, crevasses tend to shrink, but may then become much larger behind the wave as the ice goes into tension. The waves would also increase the rate of serac fall as the wave passes through icefalls.\r\n&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;\r\n&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;h4&gt;\r\n&lt;a name=\"TOC-Glacier-Surges\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Glacier Surges&lt;/h4&gt;\r\nSometimes the speed of a glacier increases very suddenly, causing a surge in the ice, sometimes of up to &lt;i&gt;30 feet in a day&lt;/i&gt;. This may be from a combination of accelerated glide, creep, and kinematic waves. Critical mass of the glacier or sudden detachment from the base rock layer may be other contributing factors. These surges can completely change the nature of a glacier, making a once passable glacier completely impassable due to the spread of icefalls and crevasses. The Muldrow glacier on Denali used to be an easy walk up until it surged in 1956. Now climbers must climb around the glacier or fly over it.&lt;/div&gt;\r\n&lt;div&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;&amp;Acirc;&amp;nbsp;\r\n\r\n\r\n&lt;h2&gt;\r\n&lt;a name=\"TOC-Crevasses\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Crevasses&lt;/h2&gt;\r\n&lt;h3&gt;\r\n&lt;a name=\"TOC-Ice-Under-Tension-Compression-and-Shear\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Ice Under Tension, Compression, and Shear&lt;/h3&gt;\r\nIce is weak and brittle in tension, and strong and plastic in compression.  This basic tendency explains much about the formation of crevasses on glaciers, and the understanding of this behavior and where it occurs is key to understanding crevasses and knowing where to expect them. This knowledge is important in planning a route across a glacier, especially if crevasses are buried but you want to minimize the likelihood that you are crossing snow bridges. \r\n&lt;p&gt;\r\nIn general, crevasses form in tension zones, where the ice undergoes tension. Compression zones on glaciers have few if any crevasses and are generally the way to go for route planning and choosing camps. These zones are formed by direct tension-compression of the ice as the glacier bends, or as a result of shear in the ice that occurs from flow differential. \r\n&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;\r\nThe figure below shows the relationship between shear and tension. This is important as it explains why crevasses have the orientation that they do, which is also important for predicting crevasse patterns on a glacier. Basically, if a block of ice is subjected to shear (1), say from faster flowing ice, it develops an equal and opposite reaction (2), say from slower moving ice or the stationary ground. These forces would cause the ice segment to spin, except it then develops equilibrating shears (3) perpendicular to (1) and (2). These shear forces can be added up vectorially to get the resulting tension and compression forces, which are equal to [2*shear force]&lt;sup&gt;0.5&lt;/sup&gt; and occur at 45 degrees to the direction of shear.\r\n&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Force diagram of a square segment of ice.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;h3&gt;\r\n&lt;a name=\"TOC-Types-of-Crevasses\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Types of Crevasses&lt;/h3&gt;\r\n&lt;h4&gt;\r\n&lt;a name=\"TOC-Transverse-Crevasses\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Transverse Crevasses&lt;/h4&gt;\r\nWhen a glacier travels over a convex surface, such as flat ground rolling into a steeper slope or the glacier rolling over a low bulge, the ice layer bends as the top layers are put into tension and the bottom layers are compressed. Another way to think of it is that the top layer must accelerate to keep up with the bottom layer as it sweeps over a greater distance to round the bulge. This tends to pull the ice apart. Because the tension develops along the fall line, transverse crevasses tend to form as straight crevasses across glaciers, perpendicular to the flow. Conversely, at the bottom of drops or in bowls, the ice is in a compression zone and is generally free of crevasses.\r\n&lt;p&gt;\r\n&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Transverse crevasse formation.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;h4&gt;\r\n&lt;a name=\"TOC-Marginal-Crevasses\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Marginal Crevasses&lt;/h4&gt;\r\nMarginal crevasses form along the sides of a glacier due to the differential flow of the ice. Glaciers move faster in the center than at the edges, which are restrained by the stationary rock on the sides and beneath the shallower ice. This difference in flow rate causes shear in-line with the glacier flow, which causes tension to develop along 45o angles facing into the flow.\r\n&lt;p&gt;\r\nSo in general, marginal crevasses form at the edges of a glacier at 45&lt;sup&gt;o&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;i&gt;into&lt;/i&gt; the flow. They can create barriers to entering and leaving a glacier, but routes can be planned through them so long as they cut diagonally onto the glacier in line with the crevasses. It is because of the continual development of marginal crevasses that routes usually travel down the center of the glacier, because crevasses there are more intermittent. \r\n&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;\r\nAlso, keep in mind that the ice between the crevasses is under compression (remember the ice shear figure?), but may be in slender strips. This could leave those sections of the glacier prone to buckling and crushing, making even these sections impassable.\r\n&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;\r\n&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Marginal crevasse formation.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;h4&gt;\r\n&lt;a name=\"TOC-Transverse-Crescentric-Crevasses\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Transverse Crescentric Crevasses&lt;/h4&gt;\r\nTransverse crescentric crevasses are a blend of transverse and marginal crevasses and tend to form as a glacier rolls onto a steepening slope as it passes through a constriction. This bends the glacier over the rise while shearing the sides. The combination of these effects creates arc-shaped crevasses that usually span most of the length of the constriction. The arc is convex facing uphill and concave facing downhill.\r\n&lt;p&gt;\r\n&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Transverse crescentric crevasse formation.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;h4&gt;\r\n&lt;a name=\"TOC-Radial-Crevasses\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Radial Crevasses&lt;/h4&gt;\r\nRadial crevasses form on the outside curve of a glacier as it rounds a corner. This outside edge travels faster to keep up with the flow, subjecting these outer regions to tension, creating straight radial crevasses, perpendicular to the flow, but radiating out from towards the center of the bend, like spokes on a wheel. Glacier routes tend to hug the inside of a bend because this region is generally free of radial crevasses and may actually be subjected to compression as the flow is slowed down here.\r\n&lt;p&gt;\r\n&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Radial crevasse formation.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;h4&gt;\r\n&lt;a name=\"TOC-Longitudinal-Crevasses\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Longitudinal Crevasses&lt;/h4&gt;\r\nLongitudinal crevasses form parallel to the flow of the glacier. They may form as a glacier passes over a bulge or ridge in line with the glacier, but they usually form near the terminus of the glacier as the ice spreads out laterally and becomes shallower, making it more sensitive to the underlying terrain. Because they form in line with the fall line, they are usually less of a barrier to travel, but it is more difficult to travel safely around them as a roped team.\r\n \r\n&lt;p&gt;\r\n&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Longitudinal crevasse formation.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;h4&gt;\r\n&lt;a name=\"TOC-Seracs-Icefalls\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Seracs &amp;amp; Icefalls&lt;/h4&gt;\r\nWhen a glacier flows off of a cliff or a very steep rise, transverse crevasses become so severe that the ice actually separates from the glacier, forming free-standing  blocks of ice that may be as large as office buildings. These provide barriers to travel when they form in large numbers, often requiring technical ice climbing to pass through them. These areas are called icefalls and are the ice analogy of a waterfall.Seracs pose objective hazards to climbers as they tend to topple, crushing anything in their path, or starting ice avalanches. Serac fall is often unpredictable, although it is more prevalent with faster moving glaciers. \r\n&lt;p&gt;\r\nIn summer as glaciers accelerate, the rate of serac fall may also accelerate, but this isn&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;t always the case. Traveling around them at night might not be any safer than traveling around them in the day. However, the rate of collapse tends to be characteristic of a glacier, so the amount of hazard or the timing of serac collapse can be deduced by watching the glacier for a day or so and keeping track of the activity.\r\n&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;\r\n&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Seracs on the Whitney Glacier (Mt Shasta, Cascades, CA)&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;h3&gt;\r\n&lt;a name=\"TOC-Identifying-Crevasses-Icefalls-from-Topographic-Maps\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Identifying Crevasses &amp;amp; Icefalls from Topographic Maps&lt;/h3&gt;\r\nFor safety, ease and speed of climbing, it is important to select good routes over glaciers. In general, routes should avoid climbing below or through icefalls, should enter and exit the glacier at strategic places, and to take a path of least resistance through the crevasses. Because of this, it is a good idea to scope out the glacier from a distance on the approach. \r\n&lt;p&gt;\r\nYou can also predict ahead of time where the easy and difficult sections or safe and dangerous sections are. Based on the concepts I discussed in the previous section on crevasses, moats, and bergschrunds, you should be able to draw a rudimentary crevassing pattern on a topographic map. For example, see the figure below of the topo map, how I&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;d assume the crevasses are (and therefore where the easiest route goes), and a satellite photograph showing the actual state of the glacier.\r\n&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;\r\n&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Locations of seracs and typical crevasse types, with a standard line of travel shown. The crevasses were drawn &amp;amp; route selection theorized based purely off of the topographic map and confirmed once overlaid on a satellite photo.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;h3&gt;\r\n&lt;a name=\"TOC-Identifying-Buried-Crevasses-on-the-Glacier\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Identifying Buried Crevasses on the Glacier&lt;/h3&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;\r\nWhen crevasses are buried under snow, it is important to spot them as soon as possible to make optimal route adjustments and avoid hazards. There are a number of ways to spot crevasses. In winter when there are no outward signs, the lead climber should regularly probe the snow with their ice axe or pole. Beyond this, there isn&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;t much one can do.\r\n&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;\r\n&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;It can be difficult to distinguish meltwater channels from crevasses.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;\r\nIn later season as the glacier begins to melt out, snow bridges begin to sag. Buried crevasses can be spotted by looking for these sagging snow bridges. Linear undulations in the glacier are a sign, especially if there is cracking in the snow surface. As this layer melts out and drops down, the troughs tend to fill with dirt and dust, darkening them. This can happen in drops too subtle to see without discoloration. \r\n&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;\r\nHowever, keep in mind that these may not actually be signs of crevasses. In addition to just being chance features in the glacier, in later seasons melt channels form on the glacier surface, which can be confused with crevasses. Windblown snow can take the form of dunes across the glacier, creating ripples with dips similar to a sagging snow bridge. So how do you tell crevasses apart from these false-positives? \r\n&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;\r\nIf you know where to expect them ahead of time, and what sort of orientation they should have there, then you can more easily discern the appropriate patters. For example, meltwater channels fall down the fall line, so unless you are worried about the formation of longitudinal crevasses, sagging snow in this orientation is probably not an indicator of a crevasse.\r\n&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;\r\nWhenever the rope team gathers together, for food breaks or for making camp, it is important to ensure that there are no buried crevasses in the area. The lead climber should probe the area around them (ideally with an avalanche probe, as ski poles and ice axes cannot probe very deep) and the campsite then belay the climbers in. Probing can be used to determine safe zone boundaries within the camp where climbers can walk around un-roped. \r\n&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;h2&gt;\r\n&lt;a name=\"TOC-Glacier-Travel-Rescue-Diagrams-\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Glacier Travel &amp;amp; Rescue (Diagrams)&lt;/h2&gt;\r\n\r\nIn brief, below are some graphics I made for illustrating some aspects of glacier travel and rescue.\r\n\r\n\r\n&lt;h3&gt;\r\n&lt;a name=\"TOC-Basic-Glacier-Travel-Techniques\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Basic Glacier Travel Techniques&lt;/h3&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;table&gt;\r\n&lt;tbody&gt;\r\n&lt;tr&gt;\r\n&lt;td&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Tie-In Lengths for Glacier Travel&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;/td&gt;\r\n&lt;td&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Traveling en-echelon while walking parallel to crevasses.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;/td&gt;\r\n&lt;/tr&gt;\r\n&lt;/tbody&gt;\r\n&lt;/table&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;End Running a Crevasse&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;h3&gt;\r\n&lt;a name=\"TOC-Self-Rescue-for-Crevasse-Rescue\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Self-Rescue for Crevasse Rescue&lt;/h3&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Texas Kick - the standard way to ascend a rope.

and I attended a wonderful slideshow presented by Les Wilson covering his FA of the Chockstone Chimney back in 1962. Intrigued by his photos and FA tales, Bryce and I kept it in mind. Last weekend we headed up to the Ribbon Falls area to check out this forgotten classic. Chockstone Chimney climbs several pitches of various chimney types, with a few noteworthy tunnel-throughs, tree climbing within chimneys, and topping out on a large forested ledge, known as Sherwood Forest, that is rarely visited by climbers. The route was dirty, but interesting, and stayed fairly moderate throughout. The 5 or so rappels needed to get down were trickier than expected, and had obviously not been used in well over a year. The one new bolt had been damaged by rockfall and I could remove it with my hand, and in the end we used up all 30\' of rapp webbing rebuilding anchors. It was a good day of adventurin\'!\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-n3mqxUnaBpY/UkxHgGY8HwI/AAAAAAACyk8/QdQoC8ITDHA/s1600/2013-09-28%252520-%252520001%252520-%252520Chockstone%252520Chimney%252520-%252520IMG_3164.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-n3mqxUnaBpY/UkxHgGY8HwI/AAAAAAACyk8/QdQoC8ITDHA/s800/2013-09-28%252520-%252520001%252520-%252520Chockstone%252520Chimney%252520-%252520IMG_3164.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Approaching Chockstone Chimney, which ascend the right corner to the sky.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-JQI997WGQkA/UkxHht-h9II/AAAAAAACylE/okC1sj0-CWg/s1600/2013-09-28%252520-%252520002%252520-%252520Chockstone%252520Chimney%252520-%252520IMG_3165.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-JQI997WGQkA/UkxHht-h9II/AAAAAAACylE/okC1sj0-CWg/s800/2013-09-28%252520-%252520002%252520-%252520Chockstone%252520Chimney%252520-%252520IMG_3165.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Chockstone Chimney.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-9Sk6Yi0QlMM/Uk5JPIIEhAI/AAAAAAACzFw/vmImO_15n28/s1600/2013-09-28%252520-%252520003a%252520-%252520Chockstone%252520Chimney%252520-%252520IMG_1839.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-9Sk6Yi0QlMM/Uk5JPIIEhAI/AAAAAAACzFw/vmImO_15n28/s800/2013-09-28%252520-%252520003a%252520-%252520Chockstone%252520Chimney%252520-%252520IMG_1839.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Dirty scramble up to the start.

It was a tough balance, to work so hard, which makes you want to breath hard, but the rock restricts any deep and heavy breathing, leaving you seriously out of breath. It would be easy to panic as you get stuck and attempt to hyperventilate, which you can\'t, which would make the feeling of needing to do it even worse.

Team Trundle, composed of Nic, Rachel, Ryan, donWolf and I, launched our assault at a leisurely 9:30 am. \r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\nAfter some forced detours around wet snow-covered steps lower down, living with some loose &amp;amp; gross rock, we soon arrived at the crux 5.2 chimney. We made short work of that, hauling 2 of the packs with the rope that I brought for ballast. Rock quality improved as we got higher. \r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\nNaturally, with there being 5 of us, we climbed the mountain by 5 different lines of attack! I chose the E Ridge to flank the summit unawares, while the others scattered back across the NE gully to knock down more rocks. donWolf took the most courageous line of all, attacking the high summit directly, suffering the worst of the loose rock. As we hadn\'t knocked enough rocks down on our ascent, we had a pretty good scree skiing extravaganza on the descent. Unfortunately we did suffer casualties, as Nic\'s shoes failed to survive the beating Laurel dished out.\r\n\r\n&lt;hr&gt;\r\n&lt;hr&gt;\r\n&lt;h2&gt;\r\n&lt;a name=\"TOC-Nighttime-Prep\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Nighttime Prep&lt;/h2&gt;\r\n\r\nNic and I had had a long day &lt;a href=\"http://www.markpthomas.com/mountaineering/trip-reports/california/mt-goode-n-buttress\"&gt;climbing the N Buttress of Mt Goode&lt;/a&gt; the day prior, so before our team was ready to take on Laurel, we had to rest and prepare . . . with beer at the nearby hot springs!\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"http://lh5.ggpht.com/-Dc1a4-F2FcE/T-AsaPaI8qI/AAAAAAABJGQ/VT7EYEozDxM/s2000/2012-06-17%252520-%25252001%252520-%252520Mammoth%252520Springs%252520Night%252520Photos.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"http://lh5.ggpht.com/-Dc1a4-F2FcE/T-AsaPaI8qI/AAAAAAABJGQ/VT7EYEozDxM/s600/2012-06-17%252520-%25252001%252520-%252520Mammoth%252520Springs%252520Night%252520Photos.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Milky Way over the Sierra from the hot springs.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"http://lh6.ggpht.com/-IHH6ucttEpY/T-Asa1bakbI/AAAAAAABJGY/5PU7_qCdL1A/s2000/2012-06-17%252520-%25252003%252520-%252520Mammoth%252520Springs%252520Night%252520Photos.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"http://lh6.ggpht.com/-IHH6ucttEpY/T-Asa1bakbI/AAAAAAABJGY/5PU7_qCdL1A/s600/2012-06-17%252520-%25252003%252520-%252520Mammoth%252520Springs%252520Night%252520Photos.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Night sky over the Sierra from the hot springs.

It is definitely one of the easiest scrambles in the Sierra in terms of approach to get to some lengthy scrambling and you can knock it off in a few hours RT if you\'re fit for running up slab and scree skiing. The gully probably has one of the highest climbing-to-approach/descent length ratios in the Sierra, so perhaps that accounts for the popularity?\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;hr&gt;\r\n&lt;hr&gt;\r\n&lt;h2&gt;\r\n&lt;a name=\"TOC-Links\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Links&lt;/h2&gt;\r\n&lt;ul&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"https://picasaweb.google.com/105894936663116565516/20120617LaurelMtnNECouloirWTeamTrundle?authuser=0&amp;amp;feat=directlink\"&gt;Picasa Album&lt;/a&gt;\r\n&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"http://www.supertopo.com/tr/Team-Trundle-Tackles-the-NE-Gully-of-Laurel-Mtn/t11571n.html\"&gt;SuperTopo TR&lt;/a&gt;\r\n&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;/ul&gt;\r\n&lt;/div&gt; \r\n'),(8,125,'/mountaineering/trip-reports/california/a-well-rounded-summitpost-gathering','Round Top (Crescent Moon Couloir &amp; W Ridge)','A Well-Rounded Summitpost Gathering','Trip_Report','content: &lt;div dir=\"ltr\"&gt;\r\n&lt;h1&gt;\r\n&lt;a name=\"TOC-A-Well-Rounded-Summitpost-Gathering\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;A Well-Rounded Summitpost Gathering&lt;/h1&gt;\r\n&lt;h2&gt;\r\n&lt;a name=\"TOC-March-20-2004\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;March 20, 2004&lt;/h2&gt;\r\n&lt;hr&gt;\r\n&lt;hr&gt;\r\n&lt;table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"2\" cellspacing=\"1\"&gt;\r\n&lt;tbody&gt;\r\n&lt;tr&gt;\r\n&lt;td width=\"40%\"&gt;\r\n&lt;font color=\"BLUE\"&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;b&gt;Stats&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/font&gt;\r\n&lt;ul&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;Route:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href=\"http://www.summitpost.org/show/route_link.pl/route_id/472/object_id/368\"&gt;Crescent Moon Couloir&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"http://www.summitpost.org/show/route_link.pl/route_id/174/object_id/368\"&gt;West Ridge&lt;/a&gt;\r\n&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;Elevation Gained:&lt;/b&gt; 2,251\'  \r\n&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;RT Distance:&lt;/b&gt; 6.2 mi  \r\n&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;RT Time:&lt;/b&gt; 9 hrs (relaxed)  \r\n&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt; Trailhead:&lt;/b&gt; Carson Pass  \r\n&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;TH Elevation:&lt;/b&gt; 8,590\'  \r\n&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;Summit Elev.:&lt;/b&gt; 10,381&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;  \r\n&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;Rating:&lt;/b&gt; II Class 3, Steep Snow  \r\n&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;Climbers:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href=\"http://www.summitpost.org/mountains/user_link.pl?user_id=13451\"&gt;Mark Thomas&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"http://www.summitpost.org/mountains/user_link.pl/user_id/583\"&gt;Dirk&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"http://www.summitpost.org/mountains/user_link.pl/user_id/15025\"&gt;Sam Mills&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"http://www.summitpost.org/mountains/user_link.pl/user_id/7522\"&gt;Misha&lt;/a&gt;, Etsuko, &lt;a href=\"http://www.summitpost.org/mountains/user_link.pl/user_id/18291\"&gt;Tyson&lt;/a&gt;, Doug (mtnartman)  \r\n&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;/ul&gt;\r\n&lt;/td&gt;\r\n&lt;td&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-hl0fvgjEtIw/TjFUkWaUXXI/AAAAAAAAj1c/WxJgiIfJ64w/s2000/RoundTop62-March04-Round%2520Top%2520closeup.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img height=\"200\" src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-hl0fvgjEtIw/TjFUkWaUXXI/AAAAAAAAj1c/WxJgiIfJ64w/s800/RoundTop62-March04-Round%2520Top%2520closeup.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;/td&gt;\r\n&lt;/tr&gt;\r\n&lt;/tbody&gt;\r\n&lt;/table&gt;\r\n&lt;hr&gt;\r\n&lt;hr&gt;\r\n\r\nRound Top had been a focus of mine for over a year by the time I climbed it. I first saw The Sisters while skiing at Kirkwood the previous spring and thought that they would make a nice short but interesting snow climb. On the internet these peaks were often listed with Round Top, so I turned my search to this peak. It was then that I stumbled across Bob Burd&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;s trip report on the peak, which was by far the highest quality of info that I had found about the peak on the internet. I e-mailed Bob, and he referred me to the Summitpost.com webpage for more info &amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#147; that was when I joined the SP community. \r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\nIn the late winter of 2004 I saw Misha announce a proposed trip to climb Casaval Ridge on Mt Shasta and I was eager to join it. I then found out about his plan to climb Round Top that spring, and I jumped at the opportunity to be a part of it. Eventually the date of the climb had fallen on March , which was the beginning of  my Spring Break.  By this time the Shasta trip seemed unlikely to happen, and I had opted to join SPer Grandwazoo on his own attempt on the route the following weekend. In order to make good use of the weekdays of spring break that I had off, I planned to climb White Mountain via the West Ridge and then Mt Langley between these climbs, making for a very intense spring break, and Round Top was the perfect peak to kick off the climbing bonanza.  \r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\nBy the time the trip occurred, the SP posting had gotten a lot of attention, and the trip had turned into an SP gathering. Sam Mills, Misha, Etsuko, Tyson, Doug, Dirk (Diggler), and I would be climbing the peak together, although Doug was going to break off from the group to climb the North East Ridge instead of the couloir. Two other SPers would climb the same route the following day.  \r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\nDirk and I managed to secure a ride up to Carson Pass with Sam Mills, and we headed up Thursday night to sleep at the pass, rather than leaving Berkeley VERY early Friday.  We were all up early Friday, and after everyone got acquainted some group photos were taken, we left the trailhead at 7:30 am. The snow was hard enough that some of us left our snow shoes behind. I was worried about how soft the snow would be descending in the afternoon, so I chose to keep mine with me. The group quickly spread out, with me, Doug, Tyson, and Sam in the front, and Dirk, Misha and Etsuko picking up the rear. We all stopped at Lake Winnemucca to take in the views and regroup.  As soon as everyone was caught up, Doug took off up the North East Ridge, and Sam and I headed up to the base of the Crescent Moon Couloir while the others rested and got their gear together.  \r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;table&gt;\r\n&lt;tbody&gt;\r\n&lt;tr&gt;\r\n&lt;td&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-ME7yWsSLdd0/TjFT6S53xyI/AAAAAAAAjyE/kn0C3hEtJas/s2000/RoundTop11-March04-Round%2520Top%2520from%2520Lake%2520Winnemucca.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-ME7yWsSLdd0/TjFT6S53xyI/AAAAAAAAjyE/kn0C3hEtJas/s400/RoundTop11-March04-Round%2520Top%2520from%2520Lake%2520Winnemucca.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Round Top from Lake Winnemucca&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;/td&gt;\r\n&lt;td&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-EGuH728Dvrw/TjFT9o24I8I/AAAAAAAAjyU/dTY01g7puJA/s2000/RoundTop15-March04-North%2520Ridge.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-EGuH728Dvrw/TjFT9o24I8I/AAAAAAAAjyU/dTY01g7puJA/s400/RoundTop15-March04-North%2520Ridge.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;The North Ridge of Round Top&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;/td&gt;\r\n&lt;/tr&gt;\r\n&lt;/tbody&gt;\r\n&lt;/table&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\nThe slope quickly steepened, and I headed straight up the steep slope (ca. 35&lt;sup&gt;o&lt;/sup&gt;) to the base of the couloir while Sam arced around the steep hill. Once I reached an area where the slope leveled off, I traversed back the way I came to see where everyone else was. Sam and I met up at about the same time at the base of the couloir and decided to head up the route rather than wait for the others.   \r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\nWe prepped ourselves for the climb and began kick stepping up the 40&lt;sup&gt;o&lt;/sup&gt; slope. The rock cliffs soon closed in around us and the snow slope steepened. Sam had put on his crampons, but since the snow was still just soft enough to kick-step, I left mine in my pack. I headed up the left side of the couloir, kick-stepping and plunging my ice axe shaft into the snow in a cane position, while Sam kick-stepped up the right side of the couloir, hooking the snow slope with his two ice axes in dagger position. We took turns photographing each other, and as the couloir narrowed we climbed more in single file, with Sam leading middle third of the couloir.  Then Sam stopped on a small step in the slope against the left wall of the couloir. I snapped some photos of him as I passed, leading the last third of the couloir.   \r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;table&gt;\r\n&lt;tbody&gt;\r\n&lt;tr&gt;\r\n&lt;td&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-bNnz7Aa_To0/UHo2wh_j1aI/AAAAAAABZlI/RENsgorcc8g/s2000/79192%2520-%2520Sam%2520Mills.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-bNnz7Aa_To0/UHo2wh_j1aI/AAAAAAABZlI/RENsgorcc8g/s200/79192%2520-%2520Sam%2520Mills.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Me and Sam Mills entering the Crescent Moon Couloir.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;/td&gt;\r\n&lt;td&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-n12sI-DsLBc/TjFUDzGo1fI/AAAAAAAAjyw/Bb1EQ-N82x0/s2000/RoundTop22-March04-Sam%2520in%2520the%2520Crescent%2520Moon%2520Couloir.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-n12sI-DsLBc/TjFUDzGo1fI/AAAAAAAAjyw/Bb1EQ-N82x0/s200/RoundTop22-March04-Sam%2520in%2520the%2520Crescent%2520Moon%2520Couloir.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Sam Mills ascending the Crescent Moon Couloir.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;/td&gt;\r\n&lt;td&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-4HRA4cPTfck/UHo2vpap-DI/AAAAAAABZk8/g4By_-xFnWg/s2000/79149%2520-%2520Sam%2520Mills.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-4HRA4cPTfck/UHo2vpap-DI/AAAAAAABZk8/g4By_-xFnWg/s200/79149%2520-%2520Sam%2520Mills.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Low in the Crescent Moon Couloir.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;/td&gt;\r\n&lt;td&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-cAY3hUzjuNA/TjFUItVhFJI/AAAAAAAAjzI/KCHhVQZrTV8/s2000/RoundTop28-March04-Sam%2520in%2520the%2520Crescent%2520Moon%2520Couloir.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-cAY3hUzjuNA/TjFUItVhFJI/AAAAAAAAjzI/KCHhVQZrTV8/s200/RoundTop28-March04-Sam%2520in%2520the%2520Crescent%2520Moon%2520Couloir.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Sam Mills in the Crescent Moon Couloir.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;/td&gt;\r\n&lt;/tr&gt;\r\n&lt;/tbody&gt;\r\n&lt;/table&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\nFrom this point the snow became noticeably harder, and some of it was wind packed.  The steepness increased and kick-stepping began to get more difficult. My knees were banging into the slope when I raised my legs to kick-step, forcing me to swing from my knee rather than my hip. This, combined with the harder snow and my increasing awareness of exposure, required me to kick three or four times before I could get a step big enough to accommodate the entire front ball of my foot.    \r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;table&gt;\r\n&lt;tbody&gt;\r\n&lt;tr&gt;\r\n&lt;td&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-SuZ2KNcFUFU/UHo2uiWkj4I/AAAAAAABZko/lZRzI2Fjmjk/s2000/79145%2520-%2520Sam%2520Mills.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-SuZ2KNcFUFU/UHo2uiWkj4I/AAAAAAABZko/lZRzI2Fjmjk/s400/79145%2520-%2520Sam%2520Mills.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;At the top of the Crescent Moon Couloir.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;/td&gt;\r\n&lt;td&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-YUtISOwxpHk/UHo2xpRh-cI/AAAAAAABZlY/eT05bkcxEdU/s2000/79417%2520-%2520Sam%2520Mills.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-YUtISOwxpHk/UHo2xpRh-cI/AAAAAAABZlY/eT05bkcxEdU/s400/79417%2520-%2520Sam%2520Mills.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Dirk (Diggler) exiting the Crescent Moon Couloir.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;/td&gt;\r\n&lt;/tr&gt;\r\n&lt;/tbody&gt;\r\n&lt;/table&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\nThe last 50 feet looked less steep and more straightforward, but this proved to be a false assumption. It was the steepest part of the route, nearing 55&lt;sup&gt;o&lt;/sup&gt;, and the snow was just barely soft enough to kick-step in. I was sinking my ice axe shaft in the snow down to the head at this time, and I made sure to angle it slightly up into the slope, in hopes that it would be harder to pull out &amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#147; the snow was hard enough and steep enough here that I doubted whether self-arrest would be possible if I fell, and now that I was above the curve in the couloir, I wouldn&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;t have much time to stop before hitting the rock wall below.  I began to feel like I was climbing a ladder, digging my free hand into the slope for support as I repositioned my ice axe. This feeling became even more pronounced when I turned around with my camera to get one last photo of Sam before topping out &amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#147; this was certainly the most exhilarating snow climb I had ever been on!  \r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;table&gt;\r\n&lt;tbody&gt;\r\n&lt;tr&gt;\r\n&lt;td&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-CRs_bZBADX4/UHo2zcGb6GI/AAAAAAABZl4/v8NqfHEM5Vc/s2000/79531%2520-%2520Sam%2520Mills.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-CRs_bZBADX4/UHo2zcGb6GI/AAAAAAABZl4/v8NqfHEM5Vc/s200/79531%2520-%2520Sam%2520Mills.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;The rest of the gang entering the Crescent Moon Couloir.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;/td&gt;\r\n&lt;td&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-cFjhvWy_hwM/UHo2x4sN4lI/AAAAAAABZlg/_-iXCOiSYV8/s2000/79451%2520-%2520Sam%2520Mills.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-cFjhvWy_hwM/UHo2x4sN4lI/AAAAAAABZlg/_-iXCOiSYV8/s200/79451%2520-%2520Sam%2520Mills.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;The rest of the gang midway up the Crescent Moon Couloir.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;/td&gt;\r\n&lt;td&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-7a407-XCPUU/UHo2wK03f3I/AAAAAAABZlA/PNyN8ClZjto/s2000/79190%2520-%2520Sam%2520Mills.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-7a407-XCPUU/UHo2wK03f3I/AAAAAAABZlA/PNyN8ClZjto/s200/79190%2520-%2520Sam%2520Mills.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Nearing the top of the Crescent Moon Couloir.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;/td&gt;\r\n&lt;td&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-xoT465amclQ/TjFUWVcSQaI/AAAAAAAAj0Q/HdMfqQ2M9xs/s2000/RoundTop45-March04-Psycho%2520Dirk%2520action%2520shot.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-xoT465amclQ/TjFUWVcSQaI/AAAAAAAAj0Q/HdMfqQ2M9xs/s200/RoundTop45-March04-Psycho%2520Dirk%2520action%2520shot.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Dirk (Diggler) exiting the Crescent Moon Couloir.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;/td&gt;\r\n&lt;/tr&gt;\r\n&lt;/tbody&gt;\r\n&lt;/table&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\nAfter Sam and I topped out, we scrambled along the ridge and looked over the north side &amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#147; we could look directly down the entire couloir! Everyone else had gathered at the base and waited for Sam and me to finish climbing before they began, and we were able to watch them enter the couloir from above, crawling up the snow like ants. \r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\nSam and continued scrambling over to the summit, doing some class 3 scrambling to gain the summit block, where Doug had been waiting for us.  It was now 10:30 am. We signed the summit register, took some photos, and made it back to the head of the couloir just as Misha and Etsuko were topping out. Dirk took his time on the last few feet, posing for some action shots as Misha shot away with his digital camera. Two backcountry snowboarders topped out on the West Ridge about then, and one of the boarders took off down the couloir while the other one headed back down the West Ridge. Everyone took their time on top, enjoying the views and trying different scrambling variations on the ridge, traversing up to the summit block several times. Eventually we headed down the West Ridge.  \r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;table&gt;\r\n&lt;tbody&gt;\r\n&lt;tr&gt;\r\n&lt;td&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-jm0hpWG6xp8/URB92g79xGI/AAAAAAABqSs/mlpit9ySRK8/s2000/46643.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-jm0hpWG6xp8/URB92g79xGI/AAAAAAABqSs/mlpit9ySRK8/s200/46643.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Dirk (Diggler) bouldering the summit block.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;/td&gt;\r\n&lt;td&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-7WxXns1qu0E/URCAEIPP6wI/AAAAAAABqT4/C29Mvqp-cBo/s2000/46672.JPG\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-7WxXns1qu0E/URCAEIPP6wI/AAAAAAABqT4/C29Mvqp-cBo/s200/46672.JPG\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Bouldering the summit block.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;/td&gt;\r\n&lt;td&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-X-GUVNAHKXM/TjFUSC7MRWI/AAAAAAAAjz4/ioQ4yGqowFU/s2000/RoundTop40-March04-Summit%2520shot%2520of%2520Sam%2520and%2520Doug.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-X-GUVNAHKXM/TjFUSC7MRWI/AAAAAAAAjz4/ioQ4yGqowFU/s200/RoundTop40-March04-Summit%2520shot%2520of%2520Sam%2520and%2520Doug.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Sam Mills and Doug (mtnartman) on the summit.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;/td&gt;\r\n&lt;td&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-woZfVtTcrhU/TjFUXH2i7MI/AAAAAAAAj0U/_ynDyX9obR8/s2000/RoundTop46-March04-North%2520Ridge.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-woZfVtTcrhU/TjFUXH2i7MI/AAAAAAAAj0U/_ynDyX9obR8/s200/RoundTop46-March04-North%2520Ridge.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Looking down the North Ridge.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;/td&gt;\r\n&lt;/tr&gt;\r\n&lt;/tbody&gt;\r\n&lt;/table&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\nSince the top of the ridge was bare, I had taken off my mittens for easier scrambling, and I foolishly left them off as I down-climbed the mixture of snow and rock on the West Ridge. As I passed a lone pair of climbers heading up the ridge, I slipped on some ice surrounding a rock and immediately self arrested. Even though I only slid a few feet, my hands got cut up. Although they didn&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;t bleed much, all of the small lacerations on my hand were extremely irritating, and since then I&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;ve taken more care to wear gloves whenever I could possibly fall on the snow.  \r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;table&gt;\r\n&lt;tbody&gt;\r\n&lt;tr&gt;\r\n&lt;td&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-w7g-jp1pn90/TjFUcG6AdBI/AAAAAAAAj0w/6DbxQMRvz5g/s2000/RoundTop52-March04-Round%2520Top%2520from%2520The%2520Sisters.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-w7g-jp1pn90/TjFUcG6AdBI/AAAAAAAAj0w/6DbxQMRvz5g/s200/RoundTop52-March04-Round%2520Top%2520from%2520The%2520Sisters.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;The West Ridge of Round Top seen from the Sisters.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;/td&gt;\r\n&lt;td&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-pkFtVxuj3z4/TjFUh7PO_sI/AAAAAAAAj1Q/5Pt2HtyBt1U/s2000/RoundTop58-March04-The%2520Sisters.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-pkFtVxuj3z4/TjFUh7PO_sI/AAAAAAAAj1Q/5Pt2HtyBt1U/s200/RoundTop58-March04-The%2520Sisters.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Sisters seen while descending Round Top.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;/td&gt;\r\n&lt;td&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-XRvmMHnzwUE/TjFUioQR_-I/AAAAAAAAj1U/WsWIznO_16U/s2000/RoundTop59-March04-The%2520Sisters.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-XRvmMHnzwUE/TjFUioQR_-I/AAAAAAAAj1U/WsWIznO_16U/s200/RoundTop59-March04-The%2520Sisters.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;/td&gt;\r\n&lt;td&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-k0SPLpx4cY0/TjFUe47B61I/AAAAAAAAj1A/CitkcGNuuic/s2000/RoundTop60-March04-Tyson%2520glissading.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-k0SPLpx4cY0/TjFUe47B61I/AAAAAAAAj1A/CitkcGNuuic/s200/RoundTop60-March04-Tyson%2520glissading.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Tyson glissading down from the West Ridge&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;/td&gt;\r\n&lt;/tr&gt;\r\n&lt;tr&gt;\r\n&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\r\n&lt;td&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-5dogcBPMP20/TjFUjQA6viI/AAAAAAAAj1Y/LT0omWW_KNI/s2000/RoundTop61-March04-Round%2520Top.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-5dogcBPMP20/TjFUjQA6viI/AAAAAAAAj1Y/LT0omWW_KNI/s200/RoundTop61-March04-Round%2520Top.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Round Top seen from the West Ridge.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;/td&gt;\r\n&lt;td&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-Aud8wuuqBD8/TjFUlLTH3NI/AAAAAAAAj1g/D3nb857-hi8/s2000/RoundTop63-March04-Round%2520Top.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-Aud8wuuqBD8/TjFUlLTH3NI/AAAAAAAAj1g/D3nb857-hi8/s200/RoundTop63-March04-Round%2520Top.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Round Top seen from the snowshoe out.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;/td&gt;\r\n&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\r\n&lt;/tr&gt;\r\n&lt;/tbody&gt;\r\n&lt;/table&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\nAs I waited for the others to regroup at the saddle, I decided to head up to the summit of the Sisters. The climb turned out to be a disappointment &amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#147; it was just a lot of sandy scree, and the snow that was present had become sloppy. Still, the summit had nice views of Round Top. I directed Tyson over to a better route up as I descended. By this time Dirk had reached the saddle and was eager to go up the Sisters. He talked me into joining him, so I climbed the hundred feet or so to the summit a second time. By the time we got back to the saddle, the others had taken off down the slope. Dirk took off the snowboard that he had carried up, and took off down the slopes. Tyson and I walked down, sinking into the snow. It was soft enough now to do some sitting glissades. At the first big slope, I tossed my pack down to see how it ran out below, and then I hurled myself down the slope. Tyson and I got several good fast runs in using this method.  \r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\nI quickly ran ahead and caught up to Misha and Etsuko. They had left their snow shoes behind and were regretting it &amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#147; they were constantly post-holing.  I enjoyed part of the ordeal with them before I finally gave up on the snow and out on my snowshoes. Although I quickly got ahead, I took a wrong turn and got off route and ended up at the highway on the west side of the pass. I followed the highway back to the Sno-Park and was the last one to reach the cars at 4:20pm.  \r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-hl0fvgjEtIw/TjFUkWaUXXI/AAAAAAAAj1c/WxJgiIfJ64w/s2000/RoundTop62-March04-Round%2520Top%2520closeup.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-hl0fvgjEtIw/TjFUkWaUXXI/AAAAAAAAj1c/WxJgiIfJ64w/s800/RoundTop62-March04-Round%2520Top%2520closeup.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Round Top seen from the snowshoe out.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\nBefore heading our separate ways, we all drove out to a restaurant in Kirkwood for a celebratory meal where we reviewed digital photos of the climb and took unflattering photos of each other. Then, Dirk, Sam, and I headed back to Berkeley. Dirk had a study session for his PE exam to look forward to the next day, and I had to get ready to drive out to Bishop the following morning.\r\n\r\n\r\n&lt;hr&gt;\r\n&lt;hr&gt;\r\n&lt;h2&gt;\r\n&lt;a name=\"TOC-Links\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Links&lt;/h2&gt;\r\n&lt;ul&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"https://picasaweb.google.com/105894936663116565516/20040320RoundTopCrescentMoonCouloir?authuser=0&amp;amp;feat=directlink\"&gt;Picasa Album&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"http://www.summitpost.org/a-well-rounded-summitpost-gathering/169437\"&gt;SummitPost TR&lt;/a&gt;\r\n&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;/ul&gt;\r\n&lt;/div&gt; \r\n'),(9,13,'/mountaineering/trip-reports/california/ne-butt-of-higher-cathedral','Higher Cathedral Rock (NE Buttress)','NE Buttress of Higher Cathedral Rock','Trip_Report','content: &lt;div dir=\"ltr\"&gt;\r\n&lt;h1&gt;\r\n&lt;a name=\"TOC-NE-Buttress-of-Higher-Cathedral-Rock\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;NE Buttress of Higher Cathedral Rock&lt;/h1&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-M38Fvd9OvSk/T8BUAslYNeI/AAAAAAABGsY/bZxgNoa9HfM/s2000/2012-04-22%2520-%2520021%2520-%2520Higher%2520Cathedral%2520Rock%2520%2526%2520Cathedral%2520Spires%2520-%2520annotatedFar.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-M38Fvd9OvSk/T8BUAslYNeI/AAAAAAABGsY/bZxgNoa9HfM/s640/2012-04-22%2520-%2520021%2520-%2520Higher%2520Cathedral%2520Rock%2520%2526%2520Cathedral%2520Spires%2520-%2520annotatedFar.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;Higher Cathedral Rock and Cathedral Spires seen from Pharaohs Beard&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\nI\'ve often heard the NEBoHC referred to as a benchmark to measure one\'s readiness for many of the long and burly routes in the Valley.

Naturally this is an ambitious route to do as a first climb with someone new, but it sounded like Jon was up to the task, so off we went!\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"http://lh3.ggpht.com/-zN0mmaNBLg8/T7nVosoXjaI/AAAAAAABGWg/gR6Hf-8N9og/s2000/2012-05-19%252520-%25252001%252520-%252520NE%252520Buttress%252520of%252520Higher%252520Cathedral.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"http://lh3.ggpht.com/-zN0mmaNBLg8/T7nVosoXjaI/AAAAAAABGWg/gR6Hf-8N9og/s600/2012-05-19%252520-%25252001%252520-%252520NE%252520Buttress%252520of%252520Higher%252520Cathedral.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;Nearing the start of the North East Buttress of Higher Cathedral Rock. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\nAfter just under an hour of hiking we reached the base of the route.

For many the crux of the route. If your butt is fat like mine, you won\'t fit through the top. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\nThe crux doesn\'t look too bad. It climbs easily enough - until you reach the end. It pinches down in a funny way and I just could not fit through the top. In fact my helmet was getting stuck! You have to do an awkward half exit to finish (by half I mean I still mostly used the crack for an occasional arm bar and torqued leg jam to make the final moves up). The steepness and exposure here definitely made the move out intimidating.\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"http://lh5.ggpht.com/-GotlYOpHXTc/T7nV6DWXF5I/AAAAAAABGX0/h8f3DVsO15w/s2000/2012-05-19%252520-%25252022%252520-%252520P7%252520Looking%252520down%252520OW%252520Crux.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"http://lh5.ggpht.com/-GotlYOpHXTc/T7nV6DWXF5I/AAAAAAABGX0/h8f3DVsO15w/s600/2012-05-19%252520-%25252022%252520-%252520P7%252520Looking%252520down%252520OW%252520Crux.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;Looking down the P7 5.9 bombay squeeze. For most this is the route crux. I couldn\'t fit through the exit so I had to climb outside of the slot to finish. Burly! &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\nAfter the crux was a 5.8 flare. It didn\'t look too bad, but the outside flare was pretty wide and the crack tapered as you climbed higher, so it was not conducive to any froggying. The rock was really slick, but had just enough face features to stem with while doing the shoulder-roll groove to slither up to the belay.\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"http://lh4.ggpht.com/-DLbtBI6ThBM/T7nV6t28qdI/AAAAAAABGX4/WD6Jesy7Q18/s2000/2012-05-19%252520-%25252023%252520-%2525205_8%252520Flare%252520on%252520P7.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"http://lh4.ggpht.com/-DLbtBI6ThBM/T7nV6t28qdI/AAAAAAABGX4/WD6Jesy7Q18/s600/2012-05-19%252520-%25252023%252520-%2525205_8%252520Flare%252520on%252520P7.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;P7 final 5.8 flare. This ended up being harder than it looked. I belayed in the blocks as per SuperTopo. I think it would have been better to either belay where the photo was taken, or (if using the alternate P6 belay) belay just beyond the blocks and 5.9 stem. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\nThe chockstone was not as nice as it looked from below, and I was tempted to stem up another body length over the next roof as it looked like the angle kicked back. However, I was out of slings to clip the pitons above, the next part looked pretty hard and likely the \"5.9 stem\" indicated as on the next pitch, and I barely had enough gear to make a belay. \r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;i&gt;The belay sucks, BTW, as I ended up half squatting on a chockstone beneath a hanging corner and the chockstone made it difficult to get Jon onto the anchor and swap gear. Plus the 5.9 stem was pretty burly for me and I was doing it right above his head. I\'d suggest either setting up a belay just before the 5.8 flare where you can sort of stand in the groove, or if you belayed after the step across, you should have enough rope and gear to climb through the 5.9 stem,a after which is a nice area to belay on.&lt;/i&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"http://lh6.ggpht.com/-IYPVvWSJ7nY/T7nV7a8TCGI/AAAAAAABGX8/lRr4zPQgPH4/s2000/2012-05-19%252520-%25252024%252520-%252520Long%252520Dark%252520Corner%252520of%252520P7.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"http://lh6.ggpht.com/-IYPVvWSJ7nY/T7nV7a8TCGI/AAAAAAABGX8/lRr4zPQgPH4/s600/2012-05-19%252520-%25252024%252520-%252520Long%252520Dark%252520Corner%252520of%252520P7.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;Looking down P7 (5.9). &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"http://lh6.ggpht.com/-nVd5WuTr0KE/T7nV9B_E12I/AAAAAAABGYA/kbOQ46bXezI/s2000/2012-05-19%252520-%25252025-%252520Jon%252520Arriving%252520at%252520P7%252520Belay.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"http://lh6.ggpht.com/-nVd5WuTr0KE/T7nV9B_E12I/AAAAAAABGYA/kbOQ46bXezI/s600/2012-05-19%252520-%25252025-%252520Jon%252520Arriving%252520at%252520P7%252520Belay.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;Jon finishing up the P7 5.8 flare. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\nI was getting pretty thirsty, but decided to hold off on water until I finished the next pitch with the traverse.\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"http://lh3.ggpht.com/-LAHxdOr6aFQ/T7nV-CNlzwI/AAAAAAABGYE/T-5gbPdsz0w/s2000/2012-05-19%252520-%25252026%252520-%252520Cathedral%252520Spires%252520from%252520P7%252520Belay.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"http://lh3.ggpht.com/-LAHxdOr6aFQ/T7nV-CNlzwI/AAAAAAABGYE/T-5gbPdsz0w/s600/2012-05-19%252520-%25252026%252520-%252520Cathedral%252520Spires%252520from%252520P7%252520Belay.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;Cathedral Spires from the P7 belay. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\nI couldn\'t really see how to do the next part, except for the first couple of moves. I launched off anyways and soon found myself doing some wide stems, twists and jams as I did some burly acrobatics to get over the bulge and step right to a lower angle ledge and the base of the next chimney.\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"http://lh3.ggpht.com/-porPMJpkGBg/T7nV_F0N8KI/AAAAAAABGYI/Oqlhc0VC0Qc/s2000/2012-05-19%252520-%25252027%252520-%252520P8.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"http://lh3.ggpht.com/-porPMJpkGBg/T7nV_F0N8KI/AAAAAAABGYI/Oqlhc0VC0Qc/s600/2012-05-19%252520-%25252027%252520-%252520P8.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;P8 (Just after the 5.9 stem starting crux).

I had brought kneepads for the route but had neglected to put them on. It turns out most of the chimneying really didn\'t involve much knee contact with the rock, and more strange hybrid stemming, chicken-winging, leg-jamming contortions, so I didn\'t miss the pads.\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"http://lh3.ggpht.com/-A4DTD3bv2qQ/T7nV_sB3EAI/AAAAAAABGYM/CNMXggC_0A8/s2000/2012-05-19%252520-%25252028%252520-%252520P9%252520Traverse.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"http://lh3.ggpht.com/-A4DTD3bv2qQ/T7nV_sB3EAI/AAAAAAABGYM/CNMXggC_0A8/s600/2012-05-19%252520-%25252028%252520-%252520P9%252520Traverse.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;P9 traverse.

It was really exposed and a bit awkward to downclimb, but no harder than 5.4 or 5.5, with the second step being more awkward.\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\nWhen Jon reached me I asked for water as I was really craving it by now. Unfortunately he had drunk the last of it! It wasn\'t a broiling day, for sure, but it was still plenty hot. Mouth parched, I set off on the next pitch with renewed motivation to finish the climb so that I could get back to our water cache at the base of the route.\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"http://lh5.ggpht.com/-d4dL-XuKgtc/T7nWBV-ydwI/AAAAAAABGYU/rQ24XFIXUjk/s2000/2012-05-19%252520-%25252030%252520-%252520Looking%252520Up%252520P10.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"http://lh5.ggpht.com/-d4dL-XuKgtc/T7nWBV-ydwI/AAAAAAABGYU/rQ24XFIXUjk/s600/2012-05-19%252520-%25252030%252520-%252520Looking%252520Up%252520P10.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;Starting up P10 (5.8). This pitch starts with some tree wresting, then lots of clean rock and some trick stems and mantels. Overall it went fast and felt like a nice break from the pitches below. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\nThe OW on P11 was quite memorable. I was very happy to have a #4 and #5 Camalot to reset as I went, especially at the crux. I have a narrow knee but big thighs and calves, so I couldn\'t get my leg in the crack where it narrowed before widening again. A hand stack took care of that conundrum, though Jon was able to get his leg in just fine and scooted along with an arm bar. \r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\nThe 5.9 roof wasn\'t too bad, although it required some steep stemming on very slick granite, and the hand jams were good enough to move on but would not hold if you lost your feet (They were about a red Camalot size). Jon actually slipped here and fell onto the rope as his hands came out - the only fall on the route.\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\nI was a little too eager to get away from the hated gear sling, so I had packed it away on P10. For P11 I racked on my left side for the right-side-in OW, which was problematic on the second OW/squeeze that was left-side in. After a sad attempt at climbing it without re-racking gear off of my left side, I downclimbed to set up for it properly.\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"http://lh6.ggpht.com/-PUX4DqeBGr4/T7nWC-MFj2I/AAAAAAABGYY/oOZKil-8k10/s2000/2012-05-19%252520-%25252031%252520-%252520Final%252520OW%252520on%252520P11.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"http://lh6.ggpht.com/-PUX4DqeBGr4/T7nWC-MFj2I/AAAAAAABGYY/oOZKil-8k10/s600/2012-05-19%252520-%25252031%252520-%252520Final%252520OW%252520on%252520P11.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;P11 final squeeze (5.8+?). P11 was a burly surprise waiting at the end, rivaling P7 as the crux pitch with a 5.8+ OW, slick 5.9 roof stem, and then this. I had already used my wide pro on the first OW, so had to run this out to the blocks above. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\nAfter the last wide surprise I climbed through some easy blocks to the top, and let out a joyous whoop. At least I intended to, but my mouth was so parched it came out more like a croak. It was time to get down to that warm beer waiting in the El Cap bear boxes!\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"http://lh6.ggpht.com/-cRg_Xvx7rWs/T7nWD_ZpadI/AAAAAAABGYc/Uuj4BkGdrP4/s2000/2012-05-19%252520-%25252032%252520-%252520Summit%252520View%252520of%252520Valley.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"http://lh6.ggpht.com/-cRg_Xvx7rWs/T7nWD_ZpadI/AAAAAAABGYc/Uuj4BkGdrP4/s600/2012-05-19%252520-%25252032%252520-%252520Summit%252520View%252520of%252520Valley.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;View from atop Higher Cathedral Rock. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\nThis was a spectacular route. The line is elegant, the position is excellent, with the Spires providing constant company on the climb, and the exposure and steepness is unrelenting. Pitch after pitch, the climbing stayed pretty sustained and the rock very clean and well protected. Oddly, this climb struck me as more like an alpine climb than many other Valley climbs, as much of the climbing involved stemming and manteling rather than repetitious jams or liebacks. I\'ll definitely be back to do this gem again!\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"http://lh6.ggpht.com/-yfgE9CrENaM/T7nWEJG0jsI/AAAAAAABGYg/ESQEUwHFiOU/s2000/2012-05-19%252520-%25252033%252520-%252520Higher%252520Cathedral%252520Spire%252520on%252520Descent.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"http://lh6.ggpht.com/-yfgE9CrENaM/T7nWEJG0jsI/AAAAAAABGYg/ESQEUwHFiOU/s600/2012-05-19%252520-%25252033%252520-%252520Higher%252520Cathedral%252520Spire%252520on%252520Descent.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;Higher Cathedral Spire seen on the descent. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;hr&gt;\r\n&lt;hr&gt;\r\n&lt;h2&gt;\r\n&lt;a name=\"TOC-Rack:\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Rack:&lt;/h2&gt;\r\nWe brought 2 sets of cams from 0.4\"-3\", a couple of C3 Camalots, and 1 #4 and 1 #5 Camalot. 1 set of nuts were also helpful here and there.

A gear sling is a good idea for the chimneys. An extra sling or two would also be helpful for coiling the rope to the side on the constricted hanging belays.\r\n\r\n&lt;hr&gt;\r\n&lt;hr&gt;\r\n&lt;h2&gt;\r\n&lt;a name=\"TOC-Links:\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Links:&lt;/h2&gt;\r\n&lt;ul&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"https://picasaweb.google.com/105894936663116565516/20120519NEButtOfHigherCathedralWJonWardIV5911P?authuser=0&amp;amp;feat=directlink\" style=\"line-height:1.25;font-size:10pt\"&gt;Picasa Photos&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=\"line-height:1.25;font-size:10pt\"&gt;\r\n&lt;/span&gt;\r\n&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://www.supertopo.com/tr/NE-Butt-of-Higher-Cathedral/t11479n.html\" style=\"line-height:1.25;font-size:10pt\"&gt;SuperTopo TR&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;/ul&gt;\r\n&lt;/div&gt; \r\n'),(10,14,'/mountaineering/trip-reports/california/the-iota-chimney','The Iota Chimney','The Iota Chimney - A Super Awesome, Must Do 5.4 in Yosemite!','Trip_Report','content: &lt;div dir=\"ltr\"&gt;\r\n&lt;h1&gt;\r\n&lt;a name=\"TOC-The-Iota-Chimney---A-Super-Awesome-Must-Do-5.4-in-Yosemite-\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;The Iota Chimney - A Super Awesome, Must Do 5.4 in Yosemite!&lt;/h1&gt;\r\n\r\nReally?

I had read about it merely as an approach to setting up top roping anchors on Chingando, and I was pleasantly surprised to find the chimney to be clean, bright, fairly tricky, interesting for \"only\" 5.4 and a fun caving adventure in it\'s own right. \r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-34uWW1KpmNc/TxpnQOLxWoI/AAAAAAAA7DY/kkOt_xXm9gQ/s2000/2012-01-15%2520-%252037a%2520-%2520Climbing%2520the%2520Iota%2520Chimney.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-34uWW1KpmNc/TxpnQOLxWoI/AAAAAAAA7DY/kkOt_xXm9gQ/s640/2012-01-15%2520-%252037a%2520-%2520Climbing%2520the%2520Iota%2520Chimney.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Self portrait in the Iota Chimney at sunset.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\nThe Iota chimney is hidden away in the Iota Flake on the forgotten far left side of Reed\'s Pinnacle. The Reid guide indicates it merely with an arrow pointing at the Iota Flake and the words \"The Iota. 5.4 chimney behind\". It isn\'t even listed as a route in it\'s own right in the guide. Guarded by a gully of decomposing class 3 rock covered in leaves and moss, the approach really isn\'t too bad if you don\'t mind a little jungle exploration. \r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-PLFN3RfNWnQ/T03gIq-BLTI/AAAAAAAA9R0/OGnziRcdzWE/s2000/2011-12-11%2520-%252031%2520-%2520Reeds%2520Pinnacle%2520Area%2520Closer%2520-%2520Annotated%2520copy.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-PLFN3RfNWnQ/T03gIq-BLTI/AAAAAAAA9R0/OGnziRcdzWE/s600/2011-12-11%2520-%252031%2520-%2520Reeds%2520Pinnacle%2520Area%2520Closer%2520-%2520Annotated%2520copy.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\nI had approached it at sunset at the end of one day in January, and then again last weekend to finally play around on Chingando. At Eric Gable\'s excellent suggestion, on the second visit we didn\'t just climb to the Chingando anchors, but also took the second pitch to the top of the formation. This second pitch was very different in nature from the first pitch, and although is still only 5.4 or so, is also runout and only appropriate for confident chimney climbers.\r\n\r\n&lt;hr&gt;\r\n&lt;hr&gt;\r\n&lt;h2&gt;\r\n&lt;a name=\"TOC-First-Visit---January-15-2012\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;First Visit - January 15, 2012&lt;/h2&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-U6t1i3T6-Iw/TxpnLXs4YxI/AAAAAAAA7CI/uZOmFu49TXo/s2000/2012-01-15%2520-%252028%2520-%2520The%2520Iota%2520Chimney.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-U6t1i3T6-Iw/TxpnLXs4YxI/AAAAAAAA7CI/uZOmFu49TXo/s512/2012-01-15%2520-%252028%2520-%2520The%2520Iota%2520Chimney.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Iota Chimney seen from behind the Iota Flake &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-GsdM-HkUSe0/TxpnMTwdImI/AAAAAAAA7Cc/5U4P9N9XKCk/s2000/2012-01-15%2520-%252030%2520-%2520Reeds%2520Pinnacle%252C%2520Left.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-GsdM-HkUSe0/TxpnMTwdImI/AAAAAAAA7Cc/5U4P9N9XKCk/s512/2012-01-15%2520-%252030%2520-%2520Reeds%2520Pinnacle%252C%2520Left.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Reed\'s Left Side seen from behind the Iota Flake &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-mwNEQ2fhnjs/TxpnNJmhjZI/AAAAAAAA7Co/iBFLgQUDLTY/s2000/2012-01-15%2520-%252032%2520-%2520Reed%2527s%2520Left%2520P2.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-mwNEQ2fhnjs/TxpnNJmhjZI/AAAAAAAA7Co/iBFLgQUDLTY/s512/2012-01-15%2520-%252032%2520-%2520Reed%2527s%2520Left%2520P2.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;5.10 OW P2 Crux of Reed\'s Left Side &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-xH7eAjDDvR4/TxpnOvHPliI/AAAAAAAA7Cw/NE31Yd40X-I/s2000/2012-01-15%2520-%252033%2520-%2520Inside%2520the%2520Iota%2520Chimney.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-xH7eAjDDvR4/TxpnOvHPliI/AAAAAAAA7Cw/NE31Yd40X-I/s512/2012-01-15%2520-%252033%2520-%2520Inside%2520the%2520Iota%2520Chimney.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Entering the Iota Chimney &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-laO1JtxQzno/TxpnOyL49TI/AAAAAAAA7C4/WfNYZXKEhZc/s2000/2012-01-15%2520-%252034%2520-%2520Looking%2520Down%2520the%2520Iota%2520Chimney.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-laO1JtxQzno/TxpnOyL49TI/AAAAAAAA7C4/WfNYZXKEhZc/s600/2012-01-15%2520-%252034%2520-%2520Looking%2520Down%2520the%2520Iota%2520Chimney.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Looking Through the Swirl of the Iota Chimney Tunnel-Through &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-198pArna45U/TxpnPK7sN1I/AAAAAAAA7DA/A3suJ72x05I/s2000/2012-01-15%2520-%252035%2520-%2520Looking%2520Up%2520the%2520Iota%2520Chimney.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-198pArna45U/TxpnPK7sN1I/AAAAAAAA7DA/A3suJ72x05I/s600/2012-01-15%2520-%252035%2520-%2520Looking%2520Up%2520the%2520Iota%2520Chimney.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Looking up the Second Pitch.

There is nothing to grab on the pedestal, and you\'re just high enough to hurt yourself if you slip out. The wide stem option seemed too insecure too since you had to practically leap over, so on my last visit I found out a secure way to enter the chimney. I kept my arms as chickenwings so that my torso wouldn\'t slip out while doing the crab shuffle.

The Chief helped me realize a new way of looking at ice climbing during an &lt;a href=\"http://www.summitpost.org/phpBB3/north-peak-ice-conditions-t59526-15.html\"&gt;exchange of ideas on SummitPost&lt;/a&gt; as to whether steepness had anything to do with the difficulty of an ice climb.\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;table border=\"1\"&gt;\r\n&lt;tbody&gt;\r\n&lt;tr&gt;\r\n&lt;td&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;\"What ever BOB PICKERING.\r\n\r\n... steepness really has absolutely nothing to do with difficulty.\r\n\r\nOver and out BOB PICKERING.\r\n- The Chief\"&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;\r\n&lt;/td&gt;\r\n&lt;/tr&gt;\r\n&lt;/tbody&gt;\r\n&lt;/table&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\nIn the spirit of this comment, I went out and did a FA of a pretty difficult ice line. I think I\'d rate it Wi0 (Walkable ice, 0).\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class=\"sites-embed-align-center-wrapping-off\"&gt;&lt;div class=\"sites-embed-border-off sites-embed\" style=\"width:425px;\"&gt;&lt;div class=\"sites-embed-content sites-embed-type-youtube\"&gt;&lt;iframe title=\"YouTube video player\" class=\"youtube-player\" type=\"text/html\" src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/W56y6U64HoE?rel=0&amp;amp;wmode=opaque\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" width=\"425\" height=\"355\"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\r\n\r\nIt was a cold December morning and the ice had formed thick on the route. For safety I made an anchor of two stacked logs on shore, in the event that the ice failed me. Eventually I ran out of rope, and in order to push the route to a logical conclusion on a nice lake ledge, I risked life and limb, cast off the rope, and soloed through the final ice bulge crux.\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-UG-cwj2FFns/Tw8Za2NWnNI/AAAAAAABAv8/j7eN6yAa9SI/s2000/2011-12-29%2520-%252034%2520-%2520Tenaya%2520Lake%2520Night%2520Ice%2520Skating.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-UG-cwj2FFns/Tw8Za2NWnNI/AAAAAAABAv8/j7eN6yAa9SI/s640/2011-12-29%2520-%252034%2520-%2520Tenaya%2520Lake%2520Night%2520Ice%2520Skating.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Scoping out the route the night before on ice skates.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;\r\n\r\n\r\nThe climb was a great workout, and a big success.\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-2OhQ_Vg_VqQ/UKxi4WQqtoI/AAAAAAABc0o/H8hAS3Y-7BE/s2000/2011-12-30%2520-%252018a%2520-%2520Tenaya%2520Ice%2520Climb%2520from%2520the%2520left.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-2OhQ_Vg_VqQ/UKxi4WQqtoI/AAAAAAABc0o/H8hAS3Y-7BE/s600/2011-12-30%2520-%252018a%2520-%2520Tenaya%2520Ice%2520Climb%2520from%2520the%2520left.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Har-duh ice climbing&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;\r\n\r\nNow be warned that although I\'ve conservatively rated the climb at Wi0, the rating is a bit sandbagged and is not without dangers and a need to exercise caution.\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;table border=\"1\"&gt;\r\n&lt;tbody&gt;\r\n&lt;tr&gt;\r\n&lt;td&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;\"I dunno Mark, that ice was pretty slippery!

The trip was as much an inward journey for me as an outward one, so I feel that ignoring details relevant to my motivations and self-reflection would miss out on a lot of the adventure. \r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\nIn a nutshell, from July 29th to August 17th I cycled solo across Western Canada, from Calgary, Alberta, to Vancouver, British Columbia via Banff, Kamloops, and Whistler. Along the way I hiked and climbed throughout the &lt;a href=\"http://www.summitpost.org/area/range/215361/canadian-rocky-mountains.html\"&gt;Canadian Rockies&lt;/a&gt; and a small amount in the Coastal Range, summitting about 10 peaks. I cycled fully self-supported (apart from supply refills along the way) with camping gear and basic scrambling equipment, and this was to be my first ever multi-day cycling tour and first time ever combining cycling with scrambling on an approach. Although it was a very ambitious trip, in the end it was a wild success, and I had many interesting experiences along the way. For those that like stats, here they are:\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;u&gt;Cycling (17 days)&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/b&gt;\r\n&lt;ul&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;Distance: 767 miles (45 miles / day)&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;Elevation Gain:  ca. 41,000 ft (2,400 ft/day)&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;Elevation Loss:  ca. 42,900 ft (2,500 ft/day)&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;Average Speed: 12 mph&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;Weight Carried: ca. 82 lbs (nearly 90 lbs when maxed out on water capacity)&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;/ul&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;u&gt;Hiking/Scrambling (8 days)&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/b&gt;\r\n&lt;ul&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;Distance: 82 miles (10 miles/day)&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;Elevation Gain: 36,010 ft (4,500 ft/day)&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;/ul&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-T08ssXYa2kg/ULXGRR9cgzI/AAAAAAABhTo/Mmzlfyu34GE/s2000/Route%2520Profile%2520-%2520Canada%2520Cycle%2520Tour%2520Accumulated.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-T08ssXYa2kg/ULXGRR9cgzI/AAAAAAABhTo/Mmzlfyu34GE/s800/Route%2520Profile%2520-%2520Canada%2520Cycle%2520Tour%2520Accumulated.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Diagrammed elevation profile of the trip (actual, not planned)&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;h2&gt;\r\n&lt;a name=\"TOC-The-Premise\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;The Premise&lt;/h2&gt;\r\n&lt;hr&gt;\r\n\r\nThe summer of 2008 was a pivotal summer for me. I was on the verge of completing my graduate studies in structural engineering, and I had just spent 6 months interning at a prestigious firm in New York City that worked on exactly the sort of projects that I had so ambitiously trained myself for over the past 5 years.\r\n\r\n&lt;table align=\"right\" cellpadding=\"5%\"&gt;\r\n&lt;tbody&gt;\r\n&lt;tr&gt;\r\n&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-wlIgR6fyO_A/TjDblrwBB6I/AAAAAAAAfiM/hdSqmMwmrwU/s2000/2007-12-08%2520-%252018%2520-%2520Winter%2520Sunset%2520at%2520LERA.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-wlIgR6fyO_A/TjDblrwBB6I/AAAAAAAAfiM/hdSqmMwmrwU/s300/2007-12-08%2520-%252018%2520-%2520Winter%2520Sunset%2520at%2520LERA.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\r\n&lt;/tr&gt;\r\n&lt;tr&gt;\r\n&lt;td&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Views from the office&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;/td&gt;\r\n&lt;/tr&gt;\r\n&lt;/tbody&gt;\r\n&lt;/table&gt;\r\n\r\nAlthough I loved New York City, the Shawagunks and the Adirondacks could barely begin to replace the outdoor lifestyle of the West that has become such a part of me. Despite being a dream job, I had turned down an offer to continue at the firm as a full employee, partly because I was insistent on finishing the optional extended portion of my degree and then contacting them, but also because I couldn&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;t decide what to do. I have always had a conflicting dichotomy of the love for big cities and the love for wilderness, and as my career track pulled me ever more strongly away from Nature, I have had a greater struggle between which passion to follow.\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\nIt was in this state that I began planning some summer excursions, partly with the idea that this might be the last time for many years that I would be able to get out in the mountains and deserts that I so loved. No summer job this year &amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#147; it was to be my last hurrah before fully entering a full-time career, and I wanted to do a number of big trips that I had been dreaming to do for a while. Or perhaps the trips could help me be at ease with scaling down my career ambitions for the sake of the mountains. For June I would spend the month in Alaska, climbing Denali with a group of climbing friends on a self-led expedition. With this trip already set in stone, I decided to take the month of July &amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#156;off&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#157; to &amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#156;rest&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#157; and recover from Denali and get in good cycling shape for my next big summer objective: cycling across Western Canada.\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\nCycling has always been very therapeutic for me, both physical and emotional, so I guess part of the idea of this trip was to be a symbolic therapy for my current angst about my future.\r\n&lt;h2&gt;\r\n&lt;a name=\"TOC-1\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;/h2&gt;\r\n&lt;h2&gt;\r\n&lt;a name=\"TOC-The-Trip\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;The Trip&lt;/h2&gt;\r\n&lt;hr&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-KSy_0btTllM/ULXHyzI88vI/AAAAAAABhfY/BvzqOoxAWPI/s2000/2008-08-03%2520-%252011%2520-%2520The%2520Death%2520Trap.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-KSy_0btTllM/ULXHyzI88vI/AAAAAAABhfY/BvzqOoxAWPI/s640/2008-08-03%2520-%252011%2520-%2520The%2520Death%2520Trap.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Valley of the 6 Glaciers (Banff National Park)&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\n\r\nI first got the idea of doing a cycling trip in the Banff/Jasper area in 1999 when I took a road trip through the area with my father. At the time I was barely getting into climbing peaks, and on the trip we didn&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;t venture far from the car as I was still recuperating from a major reconstructive knee surgery. The region left a strong impression on me &amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#147; some details in particular were the great combination of extremely rugged roadside beauty and surprisingly mild road grades through the mountains, perfect conditions for a great cycle touring route. Ever since that trip, I had casually toyed with the idea of someday cycling through there, maybe ambitiously, as a loop from Calgary.\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-2aUiJpTKRG4/ULXFpZ15zkI/AAAAAAABhNo/refsjDkQchA/s2000/Route%2520Map%25201.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Route Map - Far General\" src=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-2aUiJpTKRG4/ULXFpZ15zkI/AAAAAAABhNo/refsjDkQchA/s800/Route%2520Map%25201.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;The trip in the early planning stages. working out day divisions and noting prevailing wind directions as I was debating West-to-East vs. East-to-West&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/center&gt;\r\n\r\nOver the years as I have fallen in love with mountaineering, one major influence in my interests and ambitions in the mountains has been &lt;a href=\"http://www.summitpost.org/user_page.php?user_id=276\"&gt;Bob Burd&lt;/a&gt; and his &lt;a href=\"http://www.summitpost.org/trip-report/170475/2005-Sierra-Challenge.html\"&gt;Sierra Challenges&lt;/a&gt;.  Not only did they expand my awareness of what I could accomplish in single-day mega hikes, leading to my idea to day hike Gannett Peak, but in 2006 when I managed to do the full 10 days of the Challenge I learned a lot about multi-day ultra-endurance events and how to go about attempting them.\r\n\r\n&lt;table align=\"right\" cellpadding=\"5%\"&gt;\r\n&lt;tbody&gt;\r\n&lt;tr&gt;\r\n&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-QGF7kRnNOrM/ULXDLn5B4-I/AAAAAAABg74/UKaCosDBwTk/s2000/2008-08-18%2520-%252047%2520-%2520Buildings.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-QGF7kRnNOrM/ULXDLn5B4-I/AAAAAAABg74/UKaCosDBwTk/s400/2008-08-18%2520-%252047%2520-%2520Buildings.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\r\n&lt;/tr&gt;\r\n&lt;tr&gt;\r\n&lt;td&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Vancouver&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;/td&gt;\r\n&lt;/tr&gt;\r\n&lt;/tbody&gt;\r\n&lt;/table&gt;\r\n\r\nFrom this background, in 2008 when I decided to finally do a cycling tour in Banff, I got really ambitious. First, the trip wouldn&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;t just be about cycling in the area. I would also hike and scramble up peaks. I was confident that if I paced myself, I could go continuously for many days, and that the effort of doing day hikes in the Canadian Rockies wouldn&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;t tire me out too much for such a pace. Also, I theorized that hiking days could be &amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#156;rest&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#157; days for my cycling days, and vice-versa, since the activities use slightly different muscles.\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\nThen I just went off the deep end. I had always wanted to see Vancouver and had been learning more about Whistler and the Vancouver area, so I began to get interested in linking up my cycling trip from Calgary all the way to Vancouver. I had the time, so what the hell &amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#147; if only cycled 50 miles a day, taking all day if I wanted to, I would have time to do this. And so the idea for my uber-ambitious mega-cycling-climbing trip was born.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n&lt;h2&gt;\r\n&lt;a name=\"TOC-2\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;/h2&gt;\r\n&lt;h2&gt;\r\n&lt;a name=\"TOC-3\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;/h2&gt;\r\n&lt;h2&gt;\r\n&lt;a name=\"TOC-Partners-Planning-and-Preparation\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Partners, Planning, and Preparation&lt;/h2&gt;\r\n&lt;hr&gt;\r\n\r\nStill, the idea was a little crazy since at the time 50 miles was my all-time cycling record for one day, on an unloaded bike, and it left me wasted for a few days after. Also, I wasn&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;t about to do this alone just yet. I had never solo-toured before (or done a cycling tour for that matter), and I had done very little soloing in the mountains.\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\nFor the partner problem, I knew just who to call &amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#147; my friend Joel Wilson, who had joined me for the &lt;a href=\"http://www.markpthomas.com/mountaineering/trip-reports/wyoming/gannett-peak-the-hard-way-in-one-day\"&gt;Gannett Peak day hike sufferfest&lt;/a&gt;. He likes these sorts of trips, and he was very interested in the idea. Still, he had research to do that summer, but expected to be able to take at least a week off. So we tentatively planned for him to join me at the very least in the Banff area. This allowed the nice possibility of trying to climb Mt Assiniboine along the way, since we could afford to bring the weight of a rope and light rack on our bikes as Joel wouldn&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;t need to carry as much gear for the trip and wouldn&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;t be riding as far with it. \r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\nSadly, in the end Joel couldn&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;t take enough time off to do the whole trip, and then he got a girlfriend, so I was left friendless for the trip. At this point I was enthusiastic enough about the trip that I decided just to go solo, but Mt Assiniboine would have to wait. And my newly purchased SPOT Personal Locator Beacon could be used to let family know on a regular basis whether I was making progress on my route, so at least someone could call in a rescue if I needed one.\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\nI would fly to Calgary with my bike packed up in a box. Then I would assemble it at the airport and begin my ride. In Vancouver I would get another box to pack up my bike, and ride a Greyhound bus to Seattle to meet some friends and visit a prospective employer before shipping my bike back to Salt Lake City flying back to school in Berkeley via Los Angeles (for further job interviews). Busy month! Plus there was still the possibility of my friends in Seattle driving up to meet me in Whistler with extra climbing gear to tackle Mt Garabaldi.\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-ldaz2hVoRLw/ULXG7uGxWZI/AAAAAAABhYs/eUJWPRDHH_Y/s2000/2008-08-16%2520-%252006%2520-%2520Mt%2520Garabaldi.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-ldaz2hVoRLw/ULXG7uGxWZI/AAAAAAABhYs/eUJWPRDHH_Y/s640/2008-08-16%2520-%252006%2520-%2520Mt%2520Garabaldi.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Mt Garabaldi&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\nFor planning and preparations, I made good use of the month of July staying at home in Salt Lake City. The planning was a major hurdle in and of itself. I had absolutely no idea what I was really getting into, and I couldn&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;t find any information readily available for doing such a cycling tour, as far as where to stay, quality of roads, suggested routes, distances to be covered each day, where to restock on food and water, etc. \r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\nThat and I needed to learn how to do a multi-day cycling tour. So I designed a custom trip from scratch based on internet searches, point of personal interest, and the joys of Google Maps and Google Earth. A few variations were planned, all of which passed handily through Kamloops, making a figure-8 centered on the town. I was very tempted with a northern route via Jasper and then down the backside of the Canadian Rockies. But then that was a major detour, and I would miss Yoho National Park, which I had yet to see. So I would take Canada Highway 1 from Calgary to Kamloops. \r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\nOn the next leg, the more obvious route was to join Highway 5 and take it south and into the river valley that empties into Vancouver. This way is more well-traveled, but from what I read online, the there was a pass that was notorious for cycling tourists for its steepness and elevation gain from either side; plus, the idea of cycling through endless flat land and suburbs to get to Vancouver seemed less appealing to me.\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\nBy looking closely at maps, I picked together a northern route that took me to Cache Creek, over the Pavilion Range to Lillooete, and then over the Coastal Range in 2 hurdles, one from Lillooet to Pemberton, and then another main climb from Pemberton to Whistler. From there it was (mostly) downhill to Vancouver on the vividly-named Sea-to-Sky Highway. The idea of descending from the mountains to the ocean, cycling along a highway like California&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;s Highway 1, sandwiched between the mountains and the sea seemed too great to pass up. Plus, this route brought me in to Vancouver from the north, allowing me to get downtown with a minimum of cycling within the city.\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-7KiblvC-3Ss/ULXHUwSSjCI/AAAAAAABhb8/gWzIrUgLe2c/s2000/2008-08-17%2520-%252018%2520-%2520Howe%2520Sound.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-7KiblvC-3Ss/ULXHUwSSjCI/AAAAAAABhb8/gWzIrUgLe2c/s640/2008-08-17%2520-%252018%2520-%2520Howe%2520Sound.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;View along the Sea to Sky Highway&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\nThere was a big problem with the alternate route, though. Upon closer inspection, the stretch from Lillooet to Pemberton seemed to fade away.  Topographic maps showed a nice valley linking the two towns, but this was filled with a reservoir and I could only find railroad tracks alongside the water. There was a road (that as far as I could tell from satellite photos was paved) that cut across the arc that the valley carved through the mountains, but this shortcut had a significant climb up and over the mountains. In addition to climbing over 3,000 ft in one push, I found the first 1,500 ft to be very steep &amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#147; grades as steep as 10% and nothing less than 5%. This would not be pretty with a fully loaded touring bike at the end of a major cycling tour. I had no idea if I could even peddle up such a consistently steep grade with so much weight on my bike. Still, the picturesque descent on the Sea-to-Sky Highway ending with a sudden and dramatic entrance into Vancouver (similar to entering San Francisco via the Golden Gate Bridge) seemed too romantic of an idea to pass up. So it was settled.\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\nMy dad insisted that I was going backwards on the route, since it was against the prevailing wind, but I was set on having Vancouver as the endpoint. It seemed more rewarding and a much nicer way to end the trip by arriving someplace new. Also, research into typical wind weather data for August in the towns I was riding through showed that the winds were primarily directed by the mountains and not the prevailing current. Regardless which way I traveled, I would have headwind about half the time, tail wind the other half, and some cross-wind here and there.\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-rNosaz9Ny-M/ULXGQhqYZVI/AAAAAAABhTg/qgQMIK_tbVw/s2000/Route%2520Map%2520Small.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-rNosaz9Ny-M/ULXGQhqYZVI/AAAAAAABhTg/qgQMIK_tbVw/s800/Route%2520Map%2520Small.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;A detailed map of the route (actual, not planned)&lt;/i&gt;&lt;b&gt;\r\n&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\nWith the route known, I then digitized the route (nerdy, I know, but helpful). Not only could I plan were I should stop based on distance and elevation gain, but I could have a breakdown printed out with me to know how much distance and elevation gain between various points, which proved very helpful in the trip when I had to deviate from my planned stops (which happened a lot!) and I wanted to make informed decisions. Because there were a lot of ways in which I could break up the route, by having the map digitized on a spread sheet, I could intelligently plan stops so that I could start small with elevation gain and distance, and gradually ramp it up.\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\nAs far as climbing, I spent hours poring over guidebooks and Google Earth piecing together potential peaks. Eventually I drew up a list of possible outings (more than I could do, but then allowing for a nice variety of options). One logistic to work out was how I would get to the peaks without a car, so finding routes with reasonable cycling approaches was key. I could cycle out from a &amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#156;base camp&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#157;, climb a peak, and then head back. On peaks further out, but along my route, I could cycle over, climb the peak, and continue on to that night&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;s destination. The second concern was what I would do with the gear and food on my bike, being left unattended in Bear country. \r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\nLight camo- netting would protect my bike from theft (after it was stashed in the bushes, plus the netting could make &amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#152;questionable&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153; roadside camping easier), but were there any bear boxes at the trailheads, or would I have to bring a bear canister? A call to the ranger office in Banff answered that question &amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#147; no bear boxes, and the Canadians don&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;t trust bear canisters. My only option would be to hang food. I was also informed that I didn&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;t need to make campsite reservations as I should be able to find a site coming in on a bicycle and it being a slow year. When the ranger inquired as to my overall plans and I told him, he warned me that the stretch from around Kamloops all the way to the Coastal Range was a desert that could reach 100&lt;sup&gt;o&lt;/sup&gt; F during August. I had seen the barren areas on satellite photos, but just assumed it was barren and cool highlands &amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#147; I hadn&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;t even considered that rain-drenched British Columbia would have a desert! I would have to get across that section of my route fast &amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#147; and carry a lot of water.\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\nIn order to prep myself for the trip while trying to recover from Denali, I tried to cycle at least every other day, if not every day, for the entire month &amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#147; and when I went out I aimed to punish myself. The emphasis would be hills galore, and as fast as I could take them. Of course I would also make sure my rides were initially at least 20 miles and then gradually increase the distance to 50 miles or so. The 10-mile 2,000 ft climb in Millcreek Canyon got routine and loops from my house in Holladay to Brighton and Alta ski resorts became reasonable outings.\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\nPacking went less straightforward. By the time I had amassed all of the gear I thought I needed, it weighed over 90 lbs. After some thoughtful sorting and inventorying to see where the weight was, I managed to trim it down to 82 lbs &amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#147; still not a very good number, but it was the best I could do with the unknowns. Spread-sheeting everything, as nerdy as it seemed at the time, was very helpful, since I could make sure the weight was balanced well between my 4 panniers and rear bag. Also, bringing a printout list with me made repacking every day very easy, since everything was packed so tightly and needed to stay balanced throughout the trip.\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-76igqJaYezw/UL8HTVb7ORI/AAAAAAABkVI/8GKEFUL_TEg/s2000/Gear%2520List.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-76igqJaYezw/UL8HTVb7ORI/AAAAAAABkVI/8GKEFUL_TEg/s800/Gear%2520List.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\nIn the end I decided to go without a trailer (harder to control on downhills, and required more parts to bring for repairs) in favor of front panniers (messes with steering a tad, but otherwise lighter and simpler for airline travel), and going by what apparently is a North American preference of 70% weight on the rear and 30% weight on the front.  Also, I chose my mountain bike, outfitted with slicks, over my lighter and faster road bike. The name of the game on this ride would be comfort, and I needed as low of a gear as possible for the &amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#152;death pass&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153; near Lillooete.\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;h2&gt;\r\n&lt;a name=\"TOC-Day-0---Test-Run\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Day 0 - Test Run&lt;/h2&gt;\r\n&lt;hr&gt;\r\n\r\nPlanning and packing took much longer than expected, and my procrastination for actually loading up my bike and riding with it stretched until the day before my flight to Calgary. I planned to load it up exactly as I would ride, including wearing my climbing daypack carrying a full camelback of water, and then cycle from my house to the top of Immigration Canyon and back.This would give me a nice continuous 1,500 ft climb on grades similar to anything I expected to experience on the route except for the &amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#152;death pass&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;.\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\nThe first run didn&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;t go so well, as it was very difficult controlling the bicycle, with extremely bad fluttering in the rear, especially whenever I turned. Moving weight lower solved this problem, and I was on my way. \r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\nOverall the ride was fine once I got used to the sluggish handling and riding slower. I knew I would need to practice self-discipline in focusing on perceived effort and not speed as my pace metric for the trip so that I wouldn&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;t burn myself out. The riding wasn&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;t too bad with the weight on my bike as long as I didn&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;t try to go fast, and to my surprise, I made the climb without it being that bad. In fact, I still managed to pass some cyclists on the climb.\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\nEverything went fine until I got home. I hit the driveway a little fast, which has a sudden uphill slope from the road, and this dynamic shock caused my rear pannier rack to shear off the mounting screws. All I felt was a bump, and then there was a sudden snap as it felt like I just started tugging a block of concrete, stopping me cold. I went out for some last minute errands, including getting some stronger metal grade screws, and extra screws and other supplies. \r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\nBecause the screw sheared off, half of the screw was still wound into the threads on my bike frame, and only after drilling a griping hole to unscrew this segment with some special tools was the bike mechanic able to free the hole for the replacement screw. There was no way I would be able to carry the tools needed to fix such a breakdown if this happened again on route, so if the screws sheared off while on my ride, I would have no way to remount the rack. I would have to be very careful on my trip to avoid this type of breakdown, especially since hitting holes and bumps at speed would be unavoidable on the trip. I made a note to always check the mounting screws before and after each ride and retighten them if they came loose to avoid subjecting them to an extra dynamic shock from any bumps.\r\n&lt;div&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;/div&gt;\r\n&lt;div&gt;As much as I had hoped to be better prepared, I was out of time, and things seemed to barely be ready enough to go through with the trip. So I set off.&lt;br&gt;\r\n&amp;Acirc;&amp;nbsp;\r\n\r\n&lt;hr&gt;\r\n&lt;hr&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"http://www.markpthomas.com/mountaineering/trip-reports/canada/cycling-and-scrambling-from-calgary-to-vancouver/part-i---calgary-through-the-canadian-rockies\"&gt;Part I - Calgary through the Canadian Rockies&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"http://www.markpthomas.com/mountaineering/trip-reports/canada/cycling-and-scrambling-from-calgary-to-vancouver/part-ii---lake-louise-lake-o-hara-areas\"&gt;Part II - Lake Louise &amp;amp; Lake O\'Hara Areas&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"http://www.markpthomas.com/mountaineering/trip-reports/canada/cycling-and-scrambling-from-calgary-to-vancouver/part-iii---mishaps-in-the-middle-ranges\"&gt;Part III - Mishaps in the Middle Ranges&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"http://www.markpthomas.com/mountaineering/trip-reports/canada/cycling-and-scrambling-from-calgary-to-vancouver/part-iv---british-columbia-s-desert\"&gt;Part IV - British Columbia\'s Desert?!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"http://www.markpthomas.com/mountaineering/trip-reports/canada/cycling-and-scrambling-from-calgary-to-vancouver/part-v---crossing-the-coastal-range-to-vancouver\"&gt;Part V - Crossing the Coastal Range to Vancouver&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"http://www.markpthomas.com/mountaineering/trip-reports/canada/cycling-and-scrambling-from-calgary-to-vancouver/epilogue\"&gt;Epilogue&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;hr&gt;\r\n&lt;hr&gt;\r\n&lt;h2&gt;\r\n&lt;a name=\"TOC-Links\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Links&lt;/h2&gt;\r\n&lt;ul&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"https://picasaweb.google.com/105894936663116565516/20080728CanadaCyclingTripMapsAnnotations?authuser=0&amp;amp;feat=directlink\"&gt;Picasa Album - 2008-07-28 - Canada Cycling Trip - Maps &amp;amp; Annotations&lt;/a&gt;\r\n&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"http://www.summitpost.org/cycling-and-scrambling-from-calgary-to-vancouver/531269\"&gt;SummitPost TR&lt;/a&gt;\r\n&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;/ul&gt;\r\n&lt;/div&gt;\r\n&lt;/div&gt; \r\n'),(15,146,'/mountaineering/trip-reports/canada/cycling-and-scrambling-from-calgary-to-vancouver/part-i---calgary-through-the-canadian-rockies','Part I - Calgary through the Canadian Rockies','Part I - Calgary through the Canadian Rockies','Trip_Report','content: &lt;div dir=\"ltr\"&gt;\r\n&lt;h1&gt;\r\n&lt;a name=\"TOC-Part-I---Calgary-through-the-Canadian-Rockies\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Part I - Calgary through the Canadian Rockies&lt;/h1&gt;\r\n&lt;hr&gt;\r\n&lt;hr&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;a href=\"#Day1\"&gt;Day 1 &amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#147; Starting Out - Calgary to Banff&lt;/a&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n-&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"#Day2\"&gt;Day 2 &amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#147; Rainbows in Banff - Rest Day&lt;/a&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n-&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"#Day3\"&gt;Day 3 &amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#147; A Two&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;fer - Climbing Mt Cory &amp;amp; Mt Edith&lt;/a&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n-&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"#Day4\"&gt;Day 4 &amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#147; Moving on in Unsettled Weather - Banff to Lake Louise&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/b&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;hr&gt;\r\n&lt;hr&gt;\r\n&lt;a name=\"Day1\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\r\n&lt;h2&gt;\r\n&lt;a name=\"TOC-Day-1-Starting-Out---Calgary-to-Banff\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Day 1 &amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#147; Starting Out - &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Calgary to Banff&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;\r\n&lt;/h2&gt;\r\n&lt;hr&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-QEbvAVC11xA/ULXFwwUCAaI/AAAAAAABhO4/p2-HftIBJtc/s2000/01%2520-%2520Calgary-Banff%2520-%2520Route%2520Map.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-QEbvAVC11xA/ULXFwwUCAaI/AAAAAAABhO4/p2-HftIBJtc/s800/01%2520-%2520Calgary-Banff%2520-%2520Route%2520Map.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;\r\n&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-zid7oq6w8XU/ULXF8zSVEgI/AAAAAAABhQg/rq8ahobmCJg/s2000/01%2520-%2520Calgary%2520to%2520Banff%2520Route%2520Profile.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-zid7oq6w8XU/ULXF8zSVEgI/AAAAAAABhQg/rq8ahobmCJg/s800/01%2520-%2520Calgary%2520to%2520Banff%2520Route%2520Profile.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;u&gt;By Bike:&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/b&gt;\r\n&lt;ul&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;Distance: 97 miles\r\n&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;Elevation Gain: 4,380 ft\r\n&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;/ul&gt;\r\n\r\n\r\nMy plan for the day was to take a red-eye flight from Salt Lake City to Calgary, so that I would arrive early in the day, giving me a full day to ride. My objective was to cycle some 65 miles or so to some campgrounds just short of Canmore. The idea was better in theory than in practice - a whining infant on the flight helped give me a 24-hour sleep deficit before starting my ride.\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\nI touched down sometime around 5:30 am. I had carried two of my panniers, full, onto the airplane, and everything else was neatly packed inside my bike box or my Andanista Wild Things mountaineering pack, which were picked up without incident at the baggage claim. With a roller cart fully loaded with the gigantic bike box and all my equipment, I faced the next crux in the day&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;s plans &amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#147; customs:\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\nCustoms Officer: &amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#156;So how long are you planning on spending in Canada?&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#157;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\nMe: &amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#156;About a month&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#157;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\nCustoms Officer (looking suspicious): &amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#156;Reeeeally? And where will you be staying tonight and what will you be doing during your stay in Canada?&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#157;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\nMe: &amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#156;I don&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;t know exactly where I&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;ll be staying tonight; hopefully somewhere in the Rocky Mountains. I&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;m planning on cycling and hiking my way to Vancouver.&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#157;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\nCustoms Officer (raising an eyebrow): &amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#156;Uh huh . . . well . . . on you go (waving me through)&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#157;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\nSo far so good.\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\nAssembling my rig, however, was another matter. I set up shop on the loading/unloading curb of the terminal, unpacking all of my bags and bike frame from the box, and I spent the next hour and a half repacking things for the ride and assembling my bike. Pumping the mountain bike tires with a hand pump was very trying, and something I really hoped I&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;d only have to do this once. Assembling the front rack with my small, awkward multi-tools was also tedious. At least I was providing entertainment for the Pakistani taxi drivers that had begun to gather around my scene, taking an interest in the mess. Naturally, they all thought I was crazy.\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-W2ZyR-C76sw/ULXEnzFyFGI/AAAAAAABhGk/w8AIrOZvZFQ/s2000/2008-07-29%2520-%252001%2520-%2520Calgary%2520at%2520the%2520Airport.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-W2ZyR-C76sw/ULXEnzFyFGI/AAAAAAABhGk/w8AIrOZvZFQ/s800/2008-07-29%2520-%252001%2520-%2520Calgary%2520at%2520the%2520Airport.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Starting out from Calgary International Airport&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\nBy 7:30 I was set up and cycling my way out of the airport terminal and on the frontage road towards Calgary. The morning was amazingly clear, and it was surreal and somewhat intimidating to see downtown Calgary in the distance, and the Rocky Mountains, still further away, rising high above the Great Plains. I felt more than a little intimidated. This was my first trip to a foreign country completely alone with no one waiting for me (as foreign as Canada is), and the plans for my first day seemed huge. Biking all the way across Calgary as just a warm up seemed a large task. I felt a tad vulnerable and exposed. Could I really make it all the way to Canmore? What was I getting myself into? Well, I was finally committed, and this added to the suspense. \r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\nOnce I got into a good cycling rhythm, I forgot about my worries and began enjoying the experience. I was gradually getting used to handling my bike with its heavy load, which was a good thing since I was about to experience my next challenge - Canada&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;s ambiguous freeway system.  My understanding (Canadians, please correct me if I&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;m wrong) is that many of the freeways in Canada are distinctly different than U.S. freeways in that they aren&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;t limited access. Basically, large boulevards eventually had overpasses, underpasses, and onramps built onto them, and most of these routes still allowed pedestrians and cyclists. Plus, there wasn&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;t much of a good alternative route left once these boulevards had been converted.\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-EMPpJRqVCjw/ULXEovH6KjI/AAAAAAABhGs/zfjb_jqJKFo/s2000/2008-07-29%2520-%252002%2520-%2520Downtown%2520Calgary.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-EMPpJRqVCjw/ULXEovH6KjI/AAAAAAABhGs/zfjb_jqJKFo/s640/2008-07-29%2520-%252002%2520-%2520Downtown%2520Calgary.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Approaching downtown Calgary, with my route in the foreground&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\nSo with the high rise buildings of Calgary looming large, I found my way onto the &amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#156;freeway&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#157;, hugging the right shoulder as much as I could. I could really feel the wind from passing vehicles, not only from their size, velocity, and proximity, but also because with all of my gear, my bike had a lot more surface area to catch the side wind. As I approached the river crossing on my route through the downtown, it appeared I had no option but to go up the highway bridge that arced over the water.  This felt sooo wrong, both because the shoulder got a lot smaller (although I still was able to stay out of the traffic lanes), and also the feeling of cycling on a narrow overpass felt like it should be illegal (anywhere in the U.S. it sure would be). I sprinted on this part to get it over with as fast as possible, and soon I was spit out onto the downtown streets and onto the riverside promenade.\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-V6NEsC2L-KQ/ULXEsMeA1bI/AAAAAAABhHE/j3Wy3BgAWYw/s2000/2008-07-29%2520-%252005%2520-%2520Downtown%2520Calgary%2520%2526%2520Windmill.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-V6NEsC2L-KQ/ULXEsMeA1bI/AAAAAAABhHE/j3Wy3BgAWYw/s640/2008-07-29%2520-%252005%2520-%2520Downtown%2520Calgary%2520%2526%2520Windmill.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Calgary Riverside Promenade&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\nThe promenade offered both a very nice way to see some scenic parts of Calgary and a clear through-way through much of the city with no cars to contend with &amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#147; only early morning joggers and skaters. My getup was very suspicious in this urban environment, and at one photo stop a cute woman in her late 20s, probably on her way to work, approached me to ask what I was up to:\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\nWoman: &amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#156;So where are you cycling to today?&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#157;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\nMe: &amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#156;The Canadian Rockies, on my way to Vancouver.&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#157;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\nIn a response that became typical along my trip, she was at first surprised, next questioned my sanity, then took interest, and finally wished me a pleasant journey.\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\nEventually I crossed the river, cycled up my first mild hill (ugggh!), and found a Denny&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;s near the West end of town where I had a leisurely and ample breakfast. This brought up another problem as there weren&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;t many places to lock up a bike on my trip, and even if I could, locks would do nothing to protect all of my valuable and vital equipment that I had in my panniers. As would happen on many of my stops, the employees where nice enough to let me wheel my rig partway inside where it was out of site outside and where I could keep an eye on it.\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\nNext I was on my way out of town, entering the next critical point of my journey &amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#147; finally leaving the city and hitting the open road. I had expected this leg of the journey to be rather straightforward &amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#147; just a lot of flat ground and perhaps some bad headwind. What I hadn&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;t counted on was how much the terrain could roll at just a low enough relief that I missed it on my topo-map survey. Although the hills were mild, the ride from Calgary to the mountains was anything but flat, but rather, it was an endless series of 80-100 ft hills. \r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-bXe-ixSqHzE/ULXEs_N6cWI/AAAAAAABhHM/Qrz6ac-DxSw/s2000/2008-07-29%2520-%252007%2520-%2520Pararie%2520Cycling.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-bXe-ixSqHzE/ULXEs_N6cWI/AAAAAAABhHM/Qrz6ac-DxSw/s640/2008-07-29%2520-%252007%2520-%2520Pararie%2520Cycling.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Prairie Cycling&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;\r\n\r\n\r\nStill, they weren&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;t so bad if I shifted to the correct gear, and on this trip I was to follow a new, more meditative strategy that I would tell myself: &amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#156;Ignore your speed, only focus on the now, and pace yourself so that you can go all day. Sustainability is key here, not time. If you feel like you are working hard, ease up or lighten the gear. Eventually you will get to where you are going. And NEVER use the granny gear &amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#147; if you really need to use it, then you don&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;t have a prayer making it over the &amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#152;death pass&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;.&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#157;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\nAnother surprise along the road was experiencing the effects of traffic on a touring rig &amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#147; especially the effects of semi-trucks, small trucks, and RVs. On an unloaded bicycle on most roads, these are just intimidating nuisances, but when they are moving at high speeds, the turbulence they kick up really packs a punch, especially on a touring rig. First, a front wave of compressed air being driven forward by the vehicle hits you, knocking you forward and then away from the vehicle as it passes you. Then you enter the low-pressure suction zone behind this wave, which sucks you sideways towards the vehicle. \r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\nFinally, there is the rear suction of the vehicle, which smacks you from behind again as the vehicle passes. This whole dance of wind forces plays out in about 0.5-1 seconds and with a touring rig it was strong enough to cause a crash. You have to counter lean and steer, while controlling the inertia of the touring rig as it inevitable just moving side to side. This was even the case when I was 5 or 6 feet away on the shoulder. Even passing RVs could cause a crash from a moment of carelessness. \r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-k-PRv-aKjBc/ULXEuRuPLRI/AAAAAAABhHU/Y4aiYnLIvZU/s2000/2008-07-29%2520-%252010%2520-%2520My%2520Bike.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-k-PRv-aKjBc/ULXEuRuPLRI/AAAAAAABhHU/Y4aiYnLIvZU/s640/2008-07-29%2520-%252010%2520-%2520My%2520Bike.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;My sweet rig&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;\r\n\r\nAnother unexpected hazard is the constant encounter with small cracks, holes, and debris on the shoulder. Such small hazards cannot be seen from far away and are invisible to cars. But they are large enough to cause a crash or a flat on a bicycle and you really can only see then a few seconds before impact, so you had to be ever alert of the road surface while riding. Between the road surface hazards, and vehicle hazards, cycling was not something that could be done carelessly. Constant attention had to be paid with lots of reacting. However, as the miles wore on in my trip, this attention and reaction became more automatic and part of the background, just as much of the hazard considerations are in climbing &amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#147; sort of a semi-conscious attentiveness and reaction.\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\nThe miles reliably ticked by, and occasionally I would get glimpses of the Canadian Rockies getting ever closer &amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#147; things were finally becoming real. I was making much better time than expected, and by early afternoon I was approaching Canmore. At the time of this trip I was ignorant of proper sports nutrition for ultra-endurance events, and since breakfast all I had eaten was 2 cliff Bars and a couple of GUs. Not only was I famished, but I began to hit the wall big time. I barely manage to crawl into a gas station a few miles short of Canmore, bought a lot of salty carbohydrate-loaded junkfood and Gatorade to clean out my palate and replenish my energy and pigged out in the back parking lot before falling asleep tangled in my bike in some shade behind the store.\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;table&gt;\r\n&lt;tbody&gt;\r\n&lt;tr&gt;\r\n&lt;td&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-8-TotaZjQr4/ULXEva1nl2I/AAAAAAABhHc/Nj5iMjf9CBE/s2000/2008-07-29%2520-%252013-%2520The%2520Canadian%2520Rockies%2520Appear.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-8-TotaZjQr4/ULXEva1nl2I/AAAAAAABhHc/Nj5iMjf9CBE/s400/2008-07-29%2520-%252013-%2520The%2520Canadian%2520Rockies%2520Appear.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;They\'re getting closer!

After a nice filling dinner and conversation with a random U.S. expat that I met at the fast food joint, I saw that it was still only 6 pm, and that the Banff campground was only another 15 miles or so away &amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#147; I could easily make it there by nightfall. The prospect was too tempting and I was feeling too good to stop early, so I merged what I had conservatively planned for 2 days and continued on towards Banff. On my way out of town I came across another solo touring cyclist who was just finishing a ride of his own from Vancouver to Calgary! After getting some valuable beta on road conditions and the pass he cycled over to Kamloops (he didn&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;t come via the dreaded &amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#152;death pass&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;, but one that was still notorious), I continued on to &lt;a href=\"http://www.summitpost.org/list/170874/banff-nat-l-park.html\"&gt;Banff National Park&lt;/a&gt;.\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-2fGnXr0Pqjg/ULXEzQQrKQI/AAAAAAABhH8/wjvGB8onX7E/s2000/2008-07-29%2520-%252024%2520-%2520Canmore%2520Environs.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-2fGnXr0Pqjg/ULXEzQQrKQI/AAAAAAABhH8/wjvGB8onX7E/s640/2008-07-29%2520-%252024%2520-%2520Canmore%2520Environs.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Mountains above Canmore&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\nI made it to the turnoff from Canada Highway 1 as it started to get dark. After one last unexpected hill (painfully steep) to get up to the hilltop campground (and then another hill along the way), I made it into the campground about an hour before sunset. I felt really beat, but surprisingly fresh considering how much I had cycled. My previous distance record, set during my training rides in July, was 54 miles, unloaded. Today, my first day of the tour, I cycled 97 miles with around 80 lbs on my bike!\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\nWith no campsite reserved, and a desire to avoid the high price for a spot, I cruised the campground looking for some people willing to share a site. One benefit of touring solo is that it is much easier to do this if you&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;re alone. In no time I found a campsite that was being jointly shared by a number of solo and paired adventurers who were happy to have me as company. Technically there were too many people on the site, but we agreed I would sleep in my bivvy sack just over the hill crest and pack it up each morning so that it wasn&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;t obvious how many people were sleeping at the site. A couple of the people had just finished working for the summer and where cycling around Banff. Another guy had just finished his summer off in British Columbia, and hitchhiked out here on a whim to find work in Banff and explore the area before heading back to school in Ontario.\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\nAfter getting settled, I got back onto my unburdened bicycle and continued cycling towards town. I was told there was a convenience store about 2 miles down the road, and I was desperate for tasty food and beer. At the store I met another touring cyclist who had just finished a ride down from Jasper. He showed me some video he recorded on his cameras of all of the bears he saw along the way. I hoped to see some wildlife, but hopefully not too much of that type!\r\nAfter glorious beer, I came back to the campsite for a nice fire, more beer (my friends had invited more friends), and an early sleep in order to be rested f and up early the next day to climb Mt Rundle.\r\n\r\n\r\n&lt;a name=\"Day2\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\r\n&lt;h2&gt;\r\n&lt;a name=\"TOC-Day-2-Rainbows-in-Banff---Rest-Day\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Day 2 &amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#147; Rainbows in Banff - &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Rest Day&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;\r\n&lt;/h2&gt;\r\n&lt;hr&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;u&gt;On Foot:&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/b&gt;\r\n&lt;ul&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;Destination: Tunnel Mtn\r\n&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;Distance: 8 miles\r\n&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;Elevation Gain: 1,020 ft\r\n&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;/ul&gt;\r\n\r\nI awoke to cloudy skies and rain. Noooooo! It looked like Mt Rundle was out of the picture, since it is a good haul, and tempting fate with thunder or wet rock seemed like a bad idea. Today would be an unplanned rest day, and I guess I needed it.\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;table&gt;\r\n&lt;tbody&gt;\r\n&lt;tr&gt;\r\n&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-SlLWkriY-0o/ULXE0FCSbkI/AAAAAAABhIE/xSvhdRG_djw/s2000/2008-07-30%2520-%252004%2520-%2520Banff.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-SlLWkriY-0o/ULXE0FCSbkI/AAAAAAABhIE/xSvhdRG_djw/s640/2008-07-30%2520-%252004%2520-%2520Banff.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\r\n&lt;/tr&gt;\r\n&lt;tr&gt;\r\n&lt;td&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Rainy day in Banff&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;/td&gt;\r\n&lt;/tr&gt;\r\n&lt;/tbody&gt;\r\n&lt;/table&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\nBeing lazy, I took a campground shuttle into town where I spent most of the day wandering around doing errands and getting to know the place. At one point I stopped in at the ranger station to get some info on a possible day hike. Right before I left on my trip, my dad strongly recommended that I try to find my way into an area in Yoho National Park called Lake O&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;Hara. The lake was 10 miles away from the highway, but the road was closed to cars and bikes. The only way to get there was to hike, or take a reserved shuttle. Reservations often needed to be made weeks in advance. Once up there, the only camping available was available only by reservation 6 months in advance, and it usually filled up 6 months in advance. This makes the area relatively inaccessible to most people, but my dad suggested that I still try to find a way to get in there. \r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\nHiking 20 miles on dirt road just to get to and from the Lake seemed like a raw deal, so I was considering hiking over the continental divide on a 20-30 mile day hike, but which route? My dad was certain that you could hike up to the Abbot Mountain Hut from Lake Louise, but from what I could tell from topo maps and Google Earth, this looked very unlikely. The ranger I spoke with said this way was not advisable since the canyon headwall to gain Abbot Mountain Hut from the East was called &amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#156;The Death Trap&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#157;, as it was about 60-degree alpine ice, heavily crevassed, corniced, and within range of the regular rock and snow slides pouring off of Mt Victoria. I had another route in mind via Moraine Lake, but according to the rangers, this also required travel on a glacier that I would not want to do solo.\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\nHowever, I was in luck.  While the ranger was trying to discourage me from attempting to day hike to Lake O&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;Hara solo, a reservation at the Lake O&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;Hara campground was canceled. The ranger came back to me with an offer to take the site, which I did without hesitation. Based on my plans, I wouldn&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;t be finished in Lake Louise by then, but I could always come back before continuing West. The rangers in Yoho would even be nice enough to take my bike up in their pickup truck, despite bicycles not being allowed up there. This was for my bike&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;s security, and as long as I wasn&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;t caught riding it, they were fine with it up there.\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\nJust to make sure I understood how to store food properly for some of my en route peak bagging, I checked with the ranger on this. It turned out, after explaining my unique bicycle situation, that this ranger was the one I had spoken to on the phone a few weeks earlier when I was planning the trip! I guess he didn&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;t think I would actually go through with the trip when he said I could hang food, just out of sight of the trailhead, because all of a sudden he said I couldn&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;t do that. The only option would be to leave food at the campground lockers, forcing me to make my peakbagging plans solely on basing out of campgrounds. \r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\nThe ranger repeated the warnings about British Columbia&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;s desert but was happy to see that I had since prepared for it. After hearing about the weight of my bike, he also was really concerned about me cycling over Roger&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;s Pass, the next major pass after the Continental Divide. I knew it would be a doozy, but still nothing compared to the &amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#152;&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#152;death pass&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153; later on. After showing him my printout of the route profile to prove that I knew what I was getting into, he seemed content, we chatted a bit more, I asked again about trying to reserve a campsite in Lake Louise (he insisted that I would have no problem getting a site, so no need to bother), and then I took off to wander more.\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\nAs I walked through town, I found a very nice riverside trail system. The system links up with marshes to the north, and follows the river down to some waterfalls just south of town. Along the way are some nice informative signs about the area and nice views of the Banff Springs Hotel across the valley. \r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\nBy the time I reached the end of the trail at the rapids, I was close enough to Tunnel Mountain that I decided to wander up it for some panoramic views. Tunnel Mountain wasn&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;t really a mountain in my opinion, since it is just a small hill that rises 700 out of the town of Banff. The trail was steep but very well maintained, and I saw several train runners on my way up. \r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\nOnce I gained the summit ridge I began to catch glimpses of nearby Mt Rundle through breaks in the trees. I came across one of these views just as a magnificent rainbow had formed in the valley below, its complete spectrum of vibrant colors stretching from the left side of the valley clearly across, terminating at the base of Mt Rundle. It was surreal to see such a perfect rainbow from up high, and especially with such nice composition! I had just enough time to snap a couple of photos before it disappeared &amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#147; despite seeing many people on the trail that day, I think I was the only one who ever saw the rainbow.\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-OxFnh1sRAcY/ULXE00HArfI/AAAAAAABhIM/fKdulOKVPIU/s2000/2008-07-30%2520-%252009%2520-%2520Mt%2520Rundle%2520%2526%2520Rainbow%2520Panorama.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-OxFnh1sRAcY/ULXE00HArfI/AAAAAAABhIM/fKdulOKVPIU/s800/2008-07-30%2520-%252009%2520-%2520Mt%2520Rundle%2520%2526%2520Rainbow%2520Panorama.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Rainbow by Mt Rundle, seen from Tunnel Mtn&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\nAfter a short nap on the summit, I descended to the road and walked back to the campground. I arrived shortly before sunset. Rain had been on and off that day, but nothing too bad. The rest day was rejuvenating for me and I felt ready to tackle the next day&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;s objectives, weather permitting: Climbing Mt Cory and Edith. I turned in early so that I could be up before sunrise for an early start for a very long day.\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;a name=\"MtCory\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\r\n&lt;a name=\"MtEdith\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\r\n&lt;a name=\"Day3\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\r\n&lt;h2&gt;\r\n&lt;a name=\"TOC-Day-3-A-Two-fer---Climbing-Mt-Cory-Mt-Edith\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Day 3 &amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#147; A Two&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;fer - &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Climbing Mt Cory &amp;amp; Mt Edith&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;\r\n&lt;/h2&gt;\r\n&lt;hr&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-xd0q8Z-w2HA/ULXFse6fCmI/AAAAAAABhOA/zXkb3JnO6Ek/s2000/01a%2520-%2520Banff%2520Area%2520-%2520Route%2520Map.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-xd0q8Z-w2HA/ULXFse6fCmI/AAAAAAABhOA/zXkb3JnO6Ek/s800/01a%2520-%2520Banff%2520Area%2520-%2520Route%2520Map.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-HFv_Bz9__oE/ULXGJWB3ceI/AAAAAAABhSQ/SIw545G0Aek/s2000/01a%2520-%2520Banff-Cory-Banff%2520Route%2520Profile.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-HFv_Bz9__oE/ULXGJWB3ceI/AAAAAAABhSQ/SIw545G0Aek/s800/01a%2520-%2520Banff-Cory-Banff%2520Route%2520Profile.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;u&gt;By Bike&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/b&gt;\r\n&lt;ul&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;Distance: 22.2 miles\r\n&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;Elevation Gain: 1,000 ft\r\n&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;/ul&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;u&gt;On Foot&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/b&gt;\r\n&lt;ul&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;Destinations: &lt;a href=\"http://www.summitpost.org/mountain/rock/154182/mount-cory.html\"&gt;Mt Cory&lt;/a&gt; (9,191&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;), &lt;a href=\"http://www.summitpost.org/mountain/rock/154164/mount-edith.html\"&gt;Mt Edith&lt;/a&gt; (8,391&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;)\r\n&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;Distance: 10 miles\r\n&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;Elevation Gain: 7,500 ft\r\n&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;/ul&gt;\r\n\r\nToday I was up before sunrise to get an early start on my first day of climbing in the Canadian Rockies on my cycling tour. For today, I had decided to climb Mt Cory. It was a fairly easy but scenic &lt;a href=\"http://www.summitpost.org/route/165356/cory-scramble.html\"&gt;scramble&lt;/a&gt;, and looked to be a good warm up for getting familiar with the area. Looking in Alan Kane&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;s &amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#156;Scrambles in the Canadian Rockies,&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#157; he had a brief mention of being able to drop down to Cory Pass from the summit of Mt Cory, which sounded straightforward. This would put me only a hop, skip, slip, and a jump from the summit of Mt Edith, so I decided to tack that one on for the day too. If all went well, I would try to &lt;a href=\"http://www.summitpost.org/route/165318/three-peak-traverse.html\"&gt;traverse&lt;/a&gt; as many of Edith&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;s 3 summits as I could.\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\nI packed up camp and locked all gear that I didn&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;t need for the climb in one of the spacious campsite bear lockers and stowed the rest of the cycling and scrambling gear for the day in two lightly packed panniers.  As I started riding, I still felt a little sore from my first day, moving painfully slow on the hills. \r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-3GewAxZkphY/ULXGLTmaReI/AAAAAAABhSo/6SSlhUCtTxU/s2000/01a%2520-%2520Banff-Cory-Banff%2520GE%2520Map.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-3GewAxZkphY/ULXGLTmaReI/AAAAAAABhSo/6SSlhUCtTxU/s800/01a%2520-%2520Banff-Cory-Banff%2520GE%2520Map.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\nStill, the air was crisp and fresh, views were spectacular, and the 10 miles to my &amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#156;trailhead&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#157; went by fast. I write this in quotes because there is no trailhead for the south ridge route that I took. It is entirely cross-country and one starts from a roadside pullout on Canada Highway 1a. Due to the loop I planned to make with Edith, and figuring walking along the road would be nicer at the start of the day rather than the end. \r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-kw8e5l8h18o/ULXE1pH5AxI/AAAAAAABhIU/IdKhBkxIN9Y/s2000/2008-07-31%2520-%252004%2520-%2520TransCanada%2520Highway%2520%2526%2520Railway.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-kw8e5l8h18o/ULXE1pH5AxI/AAAAAAABhIU/IdKhBkxIN9Y/s640/2008-07-31%2520-%252004%2520-%2520TransCanada%2520Highway%2520%2526%2520Railway.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;View from the beginning of Cory\'s S Ridge&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\nI stopped riding where the road to the trailhead to Cory Pass intersected Highway 1a and found a place to hide my bicycle a short ways off in the trees. Walked by bike about 30 feet away from the road through some bushes, locked the wheels to the frame, and draped my handy camo-netting over the bike and gear. From the road it was completely invisible &amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#147; my system seemed to be working out perfectly.\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\nI walked along the road carefully looking for the landmarks described for the start of the route. One had to be careful to pick the right spot, as too soon will miss the ridge, and too late will put climbers on a number of the other sub-ridges that are dead-ends. About a mile in I easily found it by matching what I saw from the road to my Google Earth printout (hooray for landmarks!) and took on up the slopes on a nicely defined use-trail. The brush wasn&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;t too thick, and loose scree was only encountered in a few places as I climbed the headwall of the ridge, which rose very steeply from the valley. The transcontinental railroad and highway fell away below me very quickly, and I had clear panoramic views of the surrounding peaks after about an hour of fast hiking.\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-RtueMRwdOjw/ULXE2cDuKLI/AAAAAAABhIc/E4PZFLnkmcc/s2000/2008-07-31%2520-%252005%2520-%2520Banff%2520%2526%2520Mt%2520Rundle.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-RtueMRwdOjw/ULXE2cDuKLI/AAAAAAABhIc/E4PZFLnkmcc/s640/2008-07-31%2520-%252005%2520-%2520Banff%2520%2526%2520Mt%2520Rundle.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Mt Rundle and Banff&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\nJust before I gained the ridge I caught up with two lady scramblers who had parked at the turnout below. They quickly fell from site as I passed tree-line and gained the barren rocky ridge.\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\nFor such an easy route, it is still very worth doing as it is very scenic. The texture and color of the rock strata is very nice as it repeats itself in seemingly endless parallel rays. The upturned layers have also eroded into some very interesting rock formations and give the ridge an interesting architecture. The ridge often looks a tad harder than class 2, but slots in the cliffs parallel to the ridge keep providing ways to wind through.\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\nBeing at a bend in the Bow Valley, the ridge also has a lot of prominence, providing stellar views of Cascade Peak, Mt Norquay, and the summits of Mt Edith to the east. To the south are nice views of Mt Rundle rising above Banff, and you can clearly see Mt Assiniboine. It is only an 11,000 ft peak, tiny by California standards, but it is so rugged, and the low valleys in the Canadian Rockies give special status to such peaks, as any 11,000 ft peak in this range has a huge prominence, often between 5,000-6,500 ft. To the north you could clearly see all of the summits above Highway 1 stretching as far north as Lake Louise, with the 11,000 ft Mount Temple being easy to spot.\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;table&gt;\r\n&lt;tbody&gt;\r\n&lt;tr&gt;\r\n&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-hHu1fc30gas/ULXE32n_b_I/AAAAAAABhIk/24320rlH7-E/s2000/2008-07-31%2520-%252008%2520-%2520Mt%2520Cory%2520S%2520Ridge.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-hHu1fc30gas/ULXE32n_b_I/AAAAAAABhIk/24320rlH7-E/s400/2008-07-31%2520-%252008%2520-%2520Mt%2520Cory%2520S%2520Ridge.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\r\n&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-GyabeANX2aw/ULXE5jpOEyI/AAAAAAABhIs/9ZzIcwMcFJA/s2000/2008-07-31%2520-%252014%2520-%2520Mt%2520Cory%2520S%2520Ridge.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-GyabeANX2aw/ULXE5jpOEyI/AAAAAAABhIs/9ZzIcwMcFJA/s400/2008-07-31%2520-%252014%2520-%2520Mt%2520Cory%2520S%2520Ridge.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\r\n&lt;/tr&gt;\r\n&lt;tr&gt;\r\n&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-kwAc7lA9X2c/ULXE9qIzQBI/AAAAAAABhJE/YExpzdam-vI/s2000/2008-07-31%2520-%252019%2520-%2520NW%2520from%2520Mt%2520Cory.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-kwAc7lA9X2c/ULXE9qIzQBI/AAAAAAABhJE/YExpzdam-vI/s400/2008-07-31%2520-%252019%2520-%2520NW%2520from%2520Mt%2520Cory.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\r\n&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-bqnxPYoyrP8/ULXE_JZKY4I/AAAAAAABhJM/qgaNg4dQKM4/s2000/2008-07-31%2520-%252021%2520-%2520W%2520from%2520Mt%2520Cory%2520Summit.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-bqnxPYoyrP8/ULXE_JZKY4I/AAAAAAABhJM/qgaNg4dQKM4/s400/2008-07-31%2520-%252021%2520-%2520W%2520from%2520Mt%2520Cory%2520Summit.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\r\n&lt;/tr&gt;\r\n&lt;/tbody&gt;\r\n&lt;/table&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Cory\'s S Ridge&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;div&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;/div&gt;\r\n\r\nThe route was going straightforward, but near the summit the ridge began to look more rugged and I was lured off the crest and onto a deceptively easier looking path on the east side of the slopes. This turned out not to be the way to go as I quickly found myself on my first bit of frighteningly loose and steep scree in the Canadian Rockies. Here the soil was hard-packed with rocks creating nice ball-bearings, and the slope seemed steep enough to really get going if you fell. I slowed down considerably as I nervously crawled through this section, gradually learning how to use my trekking poles to help move through such terrain. \r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\nI couldn&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;t get off the slopes as the way above got much steeper, so I pressed on, expecting to find a weakness back up to the ridge. Finally I found one, although it was a very thin class 3 scramble with very loose rock, with the nasty loose slopes beneath me, so I still climbed very cautiously back up to the ridge, topping out right on the West summit. Next I traverse to the East summit, which is a short ways away along a knife-edge ridge that is usually corniced. Today it wasn&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;t, but there was a very steep snow crest on it, and my ice axe was very helpful for safely ascending the face onto and across this traverse. I made the East summit just as the lady scramblers, who had stayed on the ridge and therefore didn&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;t waste time, were reaching the West summit.\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\nThe East summit was far more exposed than the equally high West summit, with drop-offs on 3 sides. How could one get to Cory Pass from here? The route down to Cory Pass was described as leaving from the East summit about 200 feet towards the summit saddle with the West summit, descending a chute to the pass, so I reversed my path back to the saddle and then began picking my way down the scree-covered slopes funneling into a chute below. The lady scramblers must have been wondering what I was up to here, as this turned out not to be a well-traveled route.\r\n\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;table&gt;\r\n&lt;tbody&gt;\r\n&lt;tr&gt;\r\n&lt;td&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-9fAVXNWYkuQ/ULXFDFPOeWI/AAAAAAABhJs/HZtfJRvDluo/s2000/2008-07-31%2520-%252030%2520-%2520Mt%2520Rundle.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-9fAVXNWYkuQ/ULXFDFPOeWI/AAAAAAABhJs/HZtfJRvDluo/s400/2008-07-31%2520-%252030%2520-%2520Mt%2520Rundle.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;South East from Summit&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;/td&gt;\r\n&lt;td&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-KLaTFCEMMS8/ULXFCFOVaXI/AAAAAAABhJk/wmcLwgqEtns/s2000/2008-07-31%2520-%252028%2520-%2520Bow%2520Valley%2520from%2520Cory%2520summit.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-KLaTFCEMMS8/ULXFCFOVaXI/AAAAAAABhJk/wmcLwgqEtns/s400/2008-07-31%2520-%252028%2520-%2520Bow%2520Valley%2520from%2520Cory%2520summit.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;North West&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;/td&gt;\r\n&lt;/tr&gt;\r\n&lt;tr&gt;\r\n&lt;td&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-H_S03HnltWk/ULXFAU7qRTI/AAAAAAABhJU/jGV_39u7rX4/s2000/2008-07-31%2520-%252022%2520-%2520N%2520from%2520Cory%2520Summit.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-H_S03HnltWk/ULXFAU7qRTI/AAAAAAABhJU/jGV_39u7rX4/s400/2008-07-31%2520-%252022%2520-%2520N%2520from%2520Cory%2520Summit.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;North&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;/td&gt;\r\n&lt;td&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-kOLnBK8tDFI/ULXFBNS6jkI/AAAAAAABhJc/f4RrLLIv9nA/s2000/2008-07-31%2520-%252024%2520-%2520Mt%2520Assiniboine%2520from%2520Cory%2520Summit.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-kOLnBK8tDFI/ULXFBNS6jkI/AAAAAAABhJc/f4RrLLIv9nA/s400/2008-07-31%2520-%252024%2520-%2520Mt%2520Assiniboine%2520from%2520Cory%2520Summit.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Assiniboine&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;/td&gt;\r\n&lt;/tr&gt;\r\n&lt;/tbody&gt;\r\n&lt;/table&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;div&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;/div&gt;\r\n\r\nIt was very hard route finding down the slopes as there were many cliffs and slabby barriers in the way, and I had to be cautious not to get too close to those hazards, or boxed in where I would have to re-ascend the loose scree. As I knew I was a good ways West of Cory Pass, I kept expecting to see a break in the rocky ridge to the East where I could stop descending and traverse over. But no break appeared. I kept doing down, the terrain becoming steeper and route finding more complex as I went. This was not was I was expecting for the day, and the guidebook had made no mention of this. The only signs of life here was part of a deer skull melted out from some avalanche debris, and eventually I reached the bottom of the chute as it fanned out into the larger canyon for Cory Pass. At this point it was obvious that I had dropped far below Cory Pass. I saw the trail gradually ascending to it on the other side of the canyon, and it looked to be about 1,000 ft above me.

I then ascended the main rocky was of the canyon and picked my way straight up a sandy ridge back up to the trail just below the pass. This added a hard extra 1,000 ft of gain for the day, which I was not expecting. Now the day was getting late and I had to hurry to summit Edith and make it down before dark, since I still had a 10-mile bike ride back that I didn&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;t want to do in the dark.\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-qfaEB8ASaJk/ULXFOr-o0RI/AAAAAAABhK0/Up6dzXH5obA/s2000/2008-07-31%2520-%252047%2520-%2520Sundance%2520Range.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-qfaEB8ASaJk/ULXFOr-o0RI/AAAAAAABhK0/Up6dzXH5obA/s800/2008-07-31%2520-%252047%2520-%2520Sundance%2520Range.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Sundance Range from Cory Pass&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\nI could see why Cory Pass was a popular place to hike through.

My guidebook said that the summit block crux was climbed via south-facing chimneys, so I picked my way down and around the summit block to the south side. Here the chimneys were flared, angled, and vertical to overhanging. They looked like hard 5.6-5.8 to me. Around the corner &amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#147; well, there was no corner as there was only a very large cliff on the other side of the summit crest. I figured the guidebook had south-facing mixed up with north-facing and tentatively tried the first chimney that I found (which apparently is the right way).\r\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\nThe off-width chimney was just wide enough to wriggle into at the bottom, and then climb halfway embedded up the crack. My first attempt failed as I couldn&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;t do it with my pack on &amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#147; too confining. I left my pack and (sadly) camera at the base and tried again, sweeping gravel off holds inside the crack and kicking out loose gravel and scree on footholds. The top transitioned into some nice stemming and then some crimpy face climbing to get out of the crack, followed by easy scrambling to a false summit.\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\nThe real summit is very exposed &amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#147; one has to down climb off the steep backside of the false summit into a notch (crimpy and edgy class 3), and then up some steep slabs with some slightly more secure thin cracks to the high summit. This entire section has good exposure, fractured loose rock, and bad fall consequences, and as I was climbing solo out here, it took me a little while to work up the nerve, ignore my fear of heights, and sneak over to the summit and back.\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\nOn the descent I found rappel slings on the side where the guidebook said you should ascend &amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#147; definitely not the way to go, but a good option for saving time for a traverse of the summits. At this point it was late enough in the day, I was moving slowly enough, and the loose rock had me nervous enough that I decided to forgo traversing to the other summits. Maybe it was because I was climbing completely alone, far away from any real security, that made me so tentative, or that I just haven&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;t been scrambling on loose rock in a while, but I was surprised at how loose the rock seemed to me here. It was worse than anything I had encountered in most of the Western ranges in the U.S., and seemed only slightly better than the rock in the Cascade Range! \r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\nLuckily, down climbing was easier and soon I was reunited with my pack and hustling down the trail, racing daylight.  I turned on my I-Pod to some hustled down the trail, passing two backpackers heading up about halfway down to the valley. My feet were aching and I practically limped back to my bicycle. Today was a much longer and more tiring day than I had expected! Surprisingly, I felt much better being back on my bicycle, and I made it back to my campsite just after dark.\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\nExhausted, I was also famished and my touring food seemed inadequate and unappetizing at the time, so I asked my campmates about places to eat in town. They recommended a place, but warned me that the shuttle t town would stop running by the time I would be returning from dinner. So back on the bicycle I went, racing to town just in time to find to find all of the restaurants closing. My last hope was a bar, which surprisingly had good food and even better beer on tap. I thoroughly enjoyed my carb-loading beer fest, ate nearly 2 dinners, and once refreshed, biked back to camp and turned in around midnight. This was all right as the next day I had decided only to cycle the 40 miles to Lake Louise and forgo any plans to hike or scramble, so I could have a leisurely day.&lt;/div&gt;\r\n&lt;div&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&amp;Acirc;&amp;nbsp;\r\n\r\n&lt;a name=\"Day4\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\r\n&lt;h2&gt;\r\n&lt;a name=\"TOC-Day-4-Moving-on-in-Unsettled-Weather---Banff-to-Lake-Louise\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Day 4 &amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#147; Moving on in Unsettled Weather - &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Banff to Lake Louise&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;\r\n&lt;/h2&gt;\r\n&lt;hr&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-nKyRu0gjfDA/ULXFwAVw2uI/AAAAAAABhOw/Kc0Ob27HQbQ/s2000/02%2520-%2520Banff-Lake%2520Louise%2520-%2520Route%2520Map.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-nKyRu0gjfDA/ULXFwAVw2uI/AAAAAAABhOw/Kc0Ob27HQbQ/s800/02%2520-%2520Banff-Lake%2520Louise%2520-%2520Route%2520Map.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-BoCBEQReBn8/ULXF9sEFexI/AAAAAAABhQo/7lxs4sYaEro/s2000/02%2520-%2520Banff%2520to%2520Lake%2520Louise%2520Route%2520Profile.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-BoCBEQReBn8/ULXF9sEFexI/AAAAAAABhQo/7lxs4sYaEro/s800/02%2520-%2520Banff%2520to%2520Lake%2520Louise%2520Route%2520Profile.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;u&gt;By Bike&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/b&gt;\r\n&lt;ul&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;Distance: 43.5 miles\r\n&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;Elevation Gain: 2,180 ft\r\n&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;/ul&gt;\r\n\r\nToday was to be an easy day. I would pack up camp and set out again on my touring rig for a 40-mile ride to Lake Louise. Based on topos, the route looked really flat. Because I wanted to see some wildlife on my ride, and because I was getting tired of the noise and wind blasts along the main highway, I decided at the spur of the moment to ride on Canada&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;s Highway 1a, which paralleled the main highway but was much smaller and more heavily wooded.\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\nWhen I woke up, it was apparent that the day wouldn&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;t be as straightforward as I had expected. The rains had returned, but today the sky looked much more threatening. I was determined not to get caught in a deluge on the way to Banff, since I would have very little protection from the rain and little reprieve to dry out and warm up as I had no vehicle, tent, or motel room to escape into. This could especially be a problem since it was still getting down to freezing at night.\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\nStill, I only needed half a day of dry weather to make it, so I planned to sneak in my ride between bouts of bad weather. The Canadian at my campsite that was looking for work had found a job in town at an outdoor clothing store, and he was fine with me cycling into town and leaving my touring rig at his work while I got breakfast and waited out the weather. Then, if things looked better, I could pick up and go at a moment&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;s notice.\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-TcH3A14THPA/ULXHmNOIceI/AAAAAAABhd4/JrY3gnFn_aM/s2000/2008-08-01%2520-%252007%2520-%2520Stormy%2520Weather.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-TcH3A14THPA/ULXHmNOIceI/AAAAAAABhd4/JrY3gnFn_aM/s640/2008-08-01%2520-%252007%2520-%2520Stormy%2520Weather.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Uncertain weather&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\nI spent the morning hanging out at a nice breakfast joint n town call Melissa&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;s Restaurant, recommended to me by the locals and buzzing with business. I had a nice chat with a lone man that was there for surgery (apparently Banff has some great surgeons drawn there for the outdoors) and was ready to go when a deluge started. So much for cycling! So I decided to hang around, reading and living off of coffee refills. Hanging out there, alone, in my unusual cycling clothes brought some attention. In addition to the lone man I talked with, I caught the attention of Jacquie, a pretty waitress that was serving me coffee. Gradually over the morning I told her about my trip, and also about my Denali climb (which another co-worker of hers took a great interest in). She was familiar with San Francisco after traveling there for some teaching seminars, was from Easter Canada, but spending her summers working in Banff and getting into the outdoors and vibrant art community there. When I finally decided to leave to avoid taking up too much space, she gave me her card to keep in touch. My, Canadians are friendly!\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\nThe rain had stopped and the sun was peeking out, but the clouds still didn&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;t look too friendly. I figured I&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;d wait an hour more and see how things were developing, so I hung out at a coffee shop across the street from where I left my bike. The weather stayed dry, the clouds were slowly getting better, and the road had dried out, at about 1pm I hopped on my bike and took off.\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\nOddly, the 7,500 ft day of hiking and scrambling the day before, while leaving my legs sore and tired for walking, didn&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;t do much to me for cycling. I felt refreshed from my traumatic first day and made good time. Occasionally the clouds would look more threatening, but I lucked out and never felt a drop of rain the entire day. Still, the day wasn&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;t without more surprises. One downside to taking the smaller side road to the main highway was that it followed the landscape more &amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#147; lots of winding, which was nice, but there were also no road cuts. \r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\nThe road would go pretty flat for a while then hit a ridge coming down from the mountains. Here the road would just angle slightly and climb straight up the steeply at 5-8% grades, dropping just as steeply down the backside as soon as the crest was reached. Similar to my ride across the plains, these hills were only about 200 vertical feet in height, just below the resolution of topo maps, but they were very intensive, psychologically demoralizing (since I descended as soon as I finished climbing) and added up to some 2,000 feet of elevation gain where I had expected only about 400 ft!\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\nNear the end of my ride, these steep hills had taken their toll and I was tired, even though I had only been riding about half a day. I knew I was close to Lake Louise when I came across a lone cyclist that was doing a little foray out from town. The cyclist was having some problems with her cycling gears, so I welcomed the opportunity to stop and help out. After she was set on her way, I quickly made it into town and then over to the campsite.\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-jX90adB7M9o/ULXHlrrBfWI/AAAAAAABhdw/yErrazZe3R8/s2000/2008-08-01%2520-%252006%2520-%2520Mt%2520Temple%2520%2526%2520Highway%25201a.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-jX90adB7M9o/ULXHlrrBfWI/AAAAAAABhdw/yErrazZe3R8/s640/2008-08-01%2520-%252006%2520-%2520Mt%2520Temple%2520%2526%2520Highway%25201a.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Mt Temple seen from Highway 1a&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\nAs I approached the campsite entrance, things didn&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;t look good. The road was lined with signs saying the campground was full! Damn that ranger in Banff! Apparently this was a major holiday weekend in Canada, which the ranger hadn&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;t considered when he told me not to worry about making reservations. The station attendant said Castle Mountain still had space, to which I gave him a look, told him about the ranger in Banff, and also pointed out that I had just cycled from Banff in my fully loaded touring rig, the campground was 10 miles back the way I came, and that sunset was in about 30 minutes. Ergo, this information would be helpful to someone driving in a car, but not to me. Then the ranger took pity and gave me permission to just wander the campground and see if I could find someone who wouldn&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;t mind sharing a spot. He gave me some recommendations on where to look and let me on my way.\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\nSearching was a bit stressful as I was in  a hurry to find a place to bed down before nightfall, and I made rounds to every campsite in the area, and the few that looked promising had campers that weren&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;t interested in sharing. I made a 3rd final loop and saw a new camper who had just got back, who was old (but not too old), male, and alone, so perhaps would be open to sharing the cost for his site.\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\nThe man&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;s name was Andre, a Swiss who was taking a year off from work to travel through North and South America. He had bought a car for the trip, which he planned to sell in the U.S. as he didn&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;t want to be driving it down through Mexico and South America, where expected to end his trip sometime in June 2009. He was more than happy to have the company for the next couple of days and we got along great talking about the U.'),(16,147,'/mountaineering/trip-reports/canada/cycling-and-scrambling-from-calgary-to-vancouver/part-ii---lake-louise-lake-o-hara-areas','Part II - Lake Louise &amp; Lake O\'Hara Areas','Part II - Lake Louise &amp; Lake O\'Hara Areas','Trip_Report','content: &lt;div dir=\"ltr\"&gt;\r\n&lt;h1&gt;\r\n&lt;a name=\"TOC-Part-II---Lake-Louise-Lake-O-Hara-Areas\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Part II - Lake Louise &amp;amp; Lake O\'Hara Areas&lt;/h1&gt;\r\n&lt;hr&gt;\r\n&lt;hr&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;a href=\"#Day5\"&gt;Day 5 &amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#147; More Climbing - Climbing Mt St Piran and Mt Niblock&lt;/a&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n-&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"#Day6\"&gt;Day 6 &amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#147; Valley of the 6 Glaciers - And Climbing Mt Fairview&lt;/a&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n-&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"#Day7\"&gt;Day 7 &amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#147; Lake O&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;Hara Environs - Lake Louise to Lake O&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;Hara&lt;/a&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n-&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"#Day8\"&gt;Day 8 &amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#147; Abbot Pass - Lake O&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;Hara to Lake Louise&lt;/a&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n-&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"#Day9\"&gt;Day 9 &amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#147; Back for More - Climbing Mt Temple &amp;amp; Eiffel Pk&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/b&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;hr&gt;\r\n&lt;hr&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-9rzSy_9oeQQ/ULXFsxo1rEI/AAAAAAABhOI/8i3sC36B4e0/s2000/02%2520-%2520Lake%2520Louise%2520Area-%2520Route%2520Map.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-9rzSy_9oeQQ/ULXFsxo1rEI/AAAAAAABhOI/8i3sC36B4e0/s800/02%2520-%2520Lake%2520Louise%2520Area-%2520Route%2520Map.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;a name=\"MtStPiran\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\r\n&lt;a name=\"Day5\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\r\n&lt;h2&gt;\r\n&lt;a name=\"TOC-Day-5-More-Climbing---Climbing-Mt-St-Piran-and-Mt-Niblock\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Day 5 &amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#147; More Climbing - &lt;i&gt;Climbing Mt St Piran and Mt Niblock&lt;/i&gt;\r\n&lt;/h2&gt;\r\n&lt;hr&gt;\r\n&lt;table&gt;\r\n&lt;tbody&gt;\r\n&lt;tr&gt;\r\n&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-Z1s2pJFz3H8/ULXFuJw7dzI/AAAAAAABhOY/Lvtp8gomM0Q/s2000/02a%2520-%2520Lake%2520Louise%2520Area%2520-%2520St%2520Piran%2520-%2520Route%2520Map.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-Z1s2pJFz3H8/ULXFuJw7dzI/AAAAAAABhOY/Lvtp8gomM0Q/s400/02a%2520-%2520Lake%2520Louise%2520Area%2520-%2520St%2520Piran%2520-%2520Route%2520Map.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\r\n&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-gvGKkX3ruy8/ULXGIaMmmQI/AAAAAAABhSI/zwFem1Nauu4/s2000/02a%2520-%2520Lake%2520Louise%2520Route%2520Profile.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-gvGKkX3ruy8/ULXGIaMmmQI/AAAAAAABhSI/zwFem1Nauu4/s500/02a%2520-%2520Lake%2520Louise%2520Route%2520Profile.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\r\n&lt;/tr&gt;\r\n&lt;/tbody&gt;\r\n&lt;/table&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/b&gt;\r\n&lt;div&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;u&gt;By Bike&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/b&gt;\r\n&lt;ul&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;Distance: 7.6 miles\r\n&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;Elevation Gain: 700 ft\r\n&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;/ul&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;u&gt;On Foot&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/b&gt;\r\n&lt;ul&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;Destinations: &lt;a href=\"http://www.summitpost.org/mountain/rock/154219/mount-st-piran.html\"&gt;Mt St Piran&lt;/a&gt; (9,761&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;), &lt;a href=\"http://www.summitpost.org/mountain/rock/153381/mount-niblock.html\"&gt;Mt Niblock&lt;/a&gt; (DNF)\r\n&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;Distance: 9.7 miles\r\n&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;Elevation Gain: 3,620 ft\r\n&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;/ul&gt;\r\n\r\nToday I was ready for another double peak day.

The climb to Lake Louise was pretty intensive 6% grade for 700 ft, but still not nearly as steep as the &amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#152;death pass&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153; that I so feared. Before I knew it the climb was over and I was setting off on the trailhead at the Lake Louise circus grounds. The place was packed! After being mostly by myself for the past few days, only seeing people in town, seeing so many tourists on the trails here was &amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#147; well &amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#147; annoying. I locked up my bike and took off as fast as I could (on this day and others I opted to leave panniers back at the campground and ride to the trailhead with all of my gear already stowed in my backpack, which worked much better for leaving my bike).\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href=\"javascript:void(0);\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-o18Udeq9oyI/ULXGMl2EO6I/AAAAAAABhS4/hu-N2cj2B1E/s800/02a%2520-%2520Lake%2520Louise%2520Area%2520-%2520St%2520Piran%2520-%2520GE%2520Route%2520Map.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\nThe most difficult part of climbing Mt St Piran was passing all of the tourists on the trail. Luckily, they mostly faded away after the Tea Hut, and the smaller trail (more of a use-trail really) to the summit was easy to find if you were looking for it.  I made the 3,000 ft ascent to the summit in 1:45 from the lake, and the trail made it feel effortless. From the summit I had such dramatic views of the surrounding peaks that I felt like I had cheated. The mountains were so rugged, rising nearly vertical from the many glaciers below, and yet you could be well on your way to the summit after only a couple of hours of hiking or scrambling!\r\n&lt;div&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&amp;Acirc;&amp;nbsp;\r\n\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;table&gt;\r\n&lt;tbody&gt;\r\n&lt;tr&gt;\r\n&lt;td&gt;\r\n&lt;div style=\"text-align:center\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-7uAKPZ_pem0/ULXHnQfYgCI/AAAAAAABheA/Pt0fT8KSTos/s2000/2008-08-02%2520-%252004%2520-%2520Mt%2520Aberdeen.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-7uAKPZ_pem0/ULXHnQfYgCI/AAAAAAABheA/Pt0fT8KSTos/s280/2008-08-02%2520-%252004%2520-%2520Mt%2520Aberdeen.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;\r\n&lt;div style=\"text-align:center\"&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Mt Aberdeen seen from Piran\'s trail&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\r\n&lt;/b&gt;\r\n&lt;/td&gt;\r\n&lt;td&gt;\r\n&lt;div style=\"text-align:center\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-oezAXlnjl9I/ULXHo5NIz7I/AAAAAAABheQ/NRQhYZ-Ey10/s2000/2008-08-02%2520-%252006%2520-%2520Menacing%2520Pika.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-oezAXlnjl9I/ULXHo5NIz7I/AAAAAAABheQ/NRQhYZ-Ey10/s280/2008-08-02%2520-%252006%2520-%2520Menacing%2520Pika.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;\r\n&lt;div style=\"text-align:center\"&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Pissed Ground Squirrel&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\r\n&lt;/b&gt;\r\n&lt;/td&gt;\r\n&lt;td&gt;\r\n&lt;div style=\"text-align:center\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-_6Uv4to9Agg/ULXHpjS7wfI/AAAAAAABheY/6t2aozBOkqM/s2000/2008-08-02%2520-%252011%2520-%2520Mt%2520LeFroy%2520Avalanche.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-_6Uv4to9Agg/ULXHpjS7wfI/AAAAAAABheY/6t2aozBOkqM/s280/2008-08-02%2520-%252011%2520-%2520Mt%2520LeFroy%2520Avalanche.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;\r\n&lt;div style=\"text-align:center\"&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Ice Avalanche on Mt LeFroy&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\r\n&lt;/b&gt;\r\n&lt;/td&gt;\r\n&lt;/tr&gt;\r\n&lt;/tbody&gt;\r\n&lt;/table&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\nAfter being harassed by an overly aggressive squirrel that threatened to leap on my face from a rock windscreen (really, squirrel, you don&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;t want to eat this GU packet!) and enjoying a spectacular ice avalanche off of a hanging glacier on Mt LeFroy (it sounded like a jet airplane passing overhead) I continued down the backside toward peak #2, Mt Nibock. It seemed I would wrap up this day very quickly.\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\nThe descent looked questionable, but with some carefully route finding, it stayed at a chill 2nd class, only becoming really steep where the slope became grassy. I dropped down into a lower cirque and traversed across and up to the first class 3 section of the route on Mt Niblock. The scrambling went through a weakness in the cliffs separating the upper cirque from the lower one through a weakness carved by a waterfall. From a distance it looks very technical, but the cliffs actually had numerous catwalks linked together with moderate (if at times wet and exposed) class 3 sections. \r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-OcPsOmyZfhE/ULXHoMwibiI/AAAAAAABheI/GBRIoecaKp0/s2000/2008-08-02%2520-%252005%2520-%2520Panorama%2520from%2520Mt%2520St%2520Piran.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-OcPsOmyZfhE/ULXHoMwibiI/AAAAAAABheI/GBRIoecaKp0/s800/2008-08-02%2520-%252005%2520-%2520Panorama%2520from%2520Mt%2520St%2520Piran.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Whyte &amp;amp; Niblock from Piran&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\nThe route was fairly complex but straightforward, and soon I was climbing the upper cirque. Here the loose rock changed from irritating to frightening as everything began to slide. Also, many of the rocks were only a thin layer on top of slabs, and as I wandered into the upper set of cliffs, I became concerned about slipping off over the escarpments as the scree slopes approached about 40 degrees in steepness. I made ample use of my ice-axe in the dirt, using a trekking pole on my downhill side for stability as I climbed this vertical dirt.\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-xkzLYtLlQqw/ULXHtr6wW8I/AAAAAAABhew/SCgAFbNg6r8/s2000/2008-08-02%2520-%252019%2520-%2520Lake%2520Agnes%2520and%2520Tea%2520House.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-xkzLYtLlQqw/ULXHtr6wW8I/AAAAAAABhew/SCgAFbNg6r8/s800/2008-08-02%2520-%252019%2520-%2520Lake%2520Agnes%2520and%2520Tea%2520House.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Lake Agnes Tea House&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\nI was beginning to have serious reservations again about scrambling alone on such bad rock in mountains I was unfamiliar with when suddenly a number of large rocks came bouncing down the chute I was about to come up. Helmet or no, this gave me a good excuse to turn around and come down (I had taken about 2 hours to get to my highpoint here from Niblock, so not much was invested here). After descending a short ways, two climbers emerged from the chute, being the cause of the rockfall. Still not too encouraging, and I figured I might as well call it an easy day and descend with them for some company. Reversing the lower class 3 section was plenty easy technically, but because the route wandered so much in the cliffs, it was very easy to get lost since it was hard to see over the ledges.\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\nThe older man was Adrienne, a financial analyst from Edmonton and an avid mountaineer. He had led many outings for the Canadian Mountain Club, and on our descent he filled me in a lot about the club&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;s activities. He was leading Barry, a visiting Irishman, young guy, who was the boyfriend of a co-worker of Adrienne&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;s. They had summitted Niblock and said I wasn&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;t too far from it (doh!) but that the linkup to Whyte, which I had considered, had considerably more loose rock and exposure. In light of my nervousness with all of the cruddy rock, as we descended we bantered back and forth about mountaineering accidents and close calls in the mountains (which Adrienne, as a regular trip leader, had many in the Canadian Rockies to talk about).\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\nI made it back into town early, so I used the time to stop by the bike shop to address some bike issues.  My bike had started to make nasty crunching noises, and as it turned out, my chain had become stretched, which was fixed, and the teeth on the chain ring were dulling, which couldn&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;t be fixed. Also, my index shifters had been getting stuck in the clicked position, requiring me to push them back into place.  This would require new parts which the shop didn&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;t have, so I&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;d just have to live with the irritation. I asked the shop to look over my bike to make sure nothing else was wrong, since this would be a convenient place to work out newly manifest issues, but all else seemed well (as would be apparent later, was they weren&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;t).\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-bbugwGx-v58/ULXHvcgqNWI/AAAAAAABhe4/vZ5vCfHHbxA/s2000/2008-08-02%2520-%252020%2520-%2520Mt%2520Temple.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-bbugwGx-v58/ULXHvcgqNWI/AAAAAAABhe4/vZ5vCfHHbxA/s800/2008-08-02%2520-%252020%2520-%2520Mt%2520Temple.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Temple Mtn from the Lake Louise campground&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;a name=\"MtFairview\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\r\n&lt;a name=\"Day6\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\r\n&lt;h2&gt;\r\n&lt;a name=\"TOC-Day-6-Valley-of-the-6-Glaciers---And-Climbing-Mt-Fairview\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Day 6 &amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#147; Valley of the 6 Glaciers - &lt;i&gt;And Climbing Mt Fairview&lt;/i&gt;\r\n&lt;/h2&gt;\r\n&lt;hr&gt;\r\n&lt;table&gt;\r\n&lt;tbody&gt;\r\n&lt;tr&gt;\r\n&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-61aBeOiQS4Q/ULXFujM_cQI/AAAAAAABhOg/QF7La87phpk/s2000/02ab%2520-%2520Lake%2520Louise%2520Area%2520-%2520Fairview%2520-%2520Route%2520Map.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-61aBeOiQS4Q/ULXFujM_cQI/AAAAAAABhOg/QF7La87phpk/s400/02ab%2520-%2520Lake%2520Louise%2520Area%2520-%2520Fairview%2520-%2520Route%2520Map.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\r\n&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-1ji_ia0OiOw/ULXGHtTcZRI/AAAAAAABhSA/JN2EGW8-4L4/s2000/02ab%2520-%2520Lake%2520Louise%2520Route%2520Profile.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-1ji_ia0OiOw/ULXGHtTcZRI/AAAAAAABhSA/JN2EGW8-4L4/s500/02ab%2520-%2520Lake%2520Louise%2520Route%2520Profile.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\r\n&lt;/tr&gt;\r\n&lt;/tbody&gt;\r\n&lt;/table&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/b&gt;\r\n&lt;div&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;u&gt;By Bike&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/b&gt;\r\n&lt;ul&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;Distance: 9.3 miles\r\n&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;Elevation Gain: 738 ft\r\n&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;/ul&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;u&gt;On Foot&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/b&gt;\r\n&lt;ul&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;Destinations: Valley of the 6 Glaciers, &lt;a href=\"http://www.summitpost.org/mountain/rock/151994/mount-fairview.html\"&gt;Mt Fairview&lt;/a&gt; (9,002\')\r\n&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;Distance: 16.2 miles\r\n&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;Elevation Gain: 4,780 ft\r\n&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;/ul&gt;\r\n\r\nToday I must have recovered a bit more from my cycling, as the climb to Lake Louise felt much easier. Today I had two planned destinations for a moderate day out. First, I would hike up to the Valley of the 6 Glaciers, which I had learned had spectacular views, as well as front-row views to The Death Trap that my day had tried to direct me to for reaching the Abbot Mtn hut.  Because I knew this area had lots of avalanche potential, I started out early in hopes of seeing some of the mountains come down with morning warming from the sun. Next I would &lt;a href=\"http://www.summitpost.org/route/165606/se-slopes.html\"&gt;hike&lt;/a&gt; Mt Fairview, which was supposed to have excellent summit views.\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-774CuEEsunc/ULXGL3PIUHI/AAAAAAABhSw/9HMRSD6hIqY/s2000/02ab%2520-%2520Lake%2520Louise%2520Area%2520-%2520Fairview%2520-%2520GE%2520Route%2520Map.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-774CuEEsunc/ULXGL3PIUHI/AAAAAAABhSw/9HMRSD6hIqY/s800/02ab%2520-%2520Lake%2520Louise%2520Area%2520-%2520Fairview%2520-%2520GE%2520Route%2520Map.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\nThe trail from Lake Louise to Valley of the 6 Glaciers is very well maintained and littered with people all the way to the Tea Hut at its main terminus (so it was good I got there early!). Beyond the tea hut the trail becomes fainter and follows a moraine crest all the way to the cliffs at the base of Mt Victoria&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;s gigantic hanging snowfields and glacier. Once again I felt as if I had cheated, since the hike was only a mild warm up, and at the end I was treated to one of the most picturesque views I&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;ve ever had in the mountains.\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-KSy_0btTllM/ULXHyzI88vI/AAAAAAABhfY/BvzqOoxAWPI/s2000/2008-08-03%2520-%252011%2520-%2520The%2520Death%2520Trap.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-KSy_0btTllM/ULXHyzI88vI/AAAAAAABhfY/BvzqOoxAWPI/s800/2008-08-03%2520-%252011%2520-%2520The%2520Death%2520Trap.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;The \"Death Trap\"&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;table&gt;\r\n&lt;tbody&gt;\r\n&lt;tr&gt;\r\n&lt;td&gt;\r\n&lt;div style=\"text-align:center\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-vmg5hmNJxHA/ULXHwlC9yrI/AAAAAAABhfA/l_feqm3eb7A/s2000/2008-08-03%2520-%252009%2520-%2520Death%2520Trap%252C%2520Abbey%2520Hut%2520%2526%2520Avalanche.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-vmg5hmNJxHA/ULXHwlC9yrI/AAAAAAABhfA/l_feqm3eb7A/s280/2008-08-03%2520-%252009%2520-%2520Death%2520Trap%252C%2520Abbey%2520Hut%2520%2526%2520Avalanche.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;\r\n&lt;div style=\"text-align:center\"&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Avalanche in the \"Death Trap\"&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\r\n&lt;/b&gt;\r\n&lt;/td&gt;\r\n&lt;td&gt;\r\n&lt;div style=\"text-align:center\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-coIYGGgx43s/ULXHxgNOSyI/AAAAAAABhfI/Z8ppTsGBzOI/s2000/2008-08-03%2520-%252010%2520-%2520Mt%2520LeFroy.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-coIYGGgx43s/ULXHxgNOSyI/AAAAAAABhfI/Z8ppTsGBzOI/s280/2008-08-03%2520-%252010%2520-%2520Mt%2520LeFroy.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;\r\n&lt;div style=\"text-align:center\"&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Mt LeFroy&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\r\n&lt;/b&gt;\r\n&lt;/td&gt;\r\n&lt;td&gt;\r\n&lt;div style=\"text-align:center\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-fmHamj_JEJU/ULXH1XTQduI/AAAAAAABhfo/s_gifjaWzlE/s2000/2008-08-03%2520-%252017%2520-%2520The%2520Mitre.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-fmHamj_JEJU/ULXH1XTQduI/AAAAAAABhfo/s_gifjaWzlE/s280/2008-08-03%2520-%252017%2520-%2520The%2520Mitre.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;\r\n&lt;div style=\"text-align:center\"&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Mitre&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\r\n&lt;/b&gt;\r\n&lt;/td&gt;\r\n&lt;/tr&gt;\r\n&lt;/tbody&gt;\r\n&lt;/table&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\nBecause I had planned an easy day, I just hung out at the end of the trail and enjoyed the views, watching the occasional avalanche roar off Mt Victoria and into The Death Trap. After about an hour I realized I was feeling really beat. Being 6 days into my ride, I knew my body was still adapting to daily punishment with no breaks. Also, I had no idea how many calories I should be consuming each day, and I think I was under eating. \r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-VHAwM_t0Eck/ULXH9xVIFxI/AAAAAAABhgo/4GwOJU6J-Ow/s2000/2008-08-03%2520-%252038%2520-%2520Mt%2520Aberdeen%2520from%2520Fairview.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-VHAwM_t0Eck/ULXH9xVIFxI/AAAAAAABhgo/4GwOJU6J-Ow/s800/2008-08-03%2520-%252038%2520-%2520Mt%2520Aberdeen%2520from%2520Fairview.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Mt Aberdeen from Mt Fairview&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\nI wandered back down for more lounging at the Tea Hut, where I treated myself to some coffee and chocolate cake from a nice second-story porch views of Mt Victoria and Mt LeFroy. At one point there was another icefall on Mt LeFroy that sounded like a jet engine. I never saw the slide, but I saw the snow plume and shockwave blow out from the cirque by the Mitre. Once again, sitting in the Tea Hut, I felt really spoiled at how easy it was to get here and how comfortably I was experiencing it &amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#147; definitely more a European style to experiencing the mountains than American!\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\nStill feeling beat I read a book for a while and spaced out, all but giving up on plans to climb Mt Fairview. Still, I didn&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;t want to admit defeat, and I decided I should head down and just see how I feel at the trailhead. If I hiked back fast enough, then I might have just enough time to run up the peak and make it back to the town for dinner before the restaurants closed.\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-XOkAs8vvjBs/ULXIDIFgMII/AAAAAAABhhY/qVBJuRaqOgU/s2000/2008-08-04%2520-%252001%2520-%2520Mt%2520Fairview.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-XOkAs8vvjBs/ULXIDIFgMII/AAAAAAABhhY/qVBJuRaqOgU/s800/2008-08-04%2520-%252001%2520-%2520Mt%2520Fairview.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Mt Fairview&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\nOnce I made it to the trailhead I inexplicably got a second wind and decided to see if I could make the 3,300 ft ascent in less than 1.5 hours. I blasted the Nine Inch Nails on my I-Pod and took off as fast as I could. The last 500 vertical feet of trail was very steep, requiring a lot of high-stepping. I guess whatever was in the Tea Hut&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;s chocolate cake finally hit me, because while the other hikers here were moving at a snail pace, starting and stopping, I felt lighter than air, jumping up the high-steps and half-jogging up the trail and making the summit somewhere between 1-1:20 from the trail head &amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#147; ascending over 2,500 ft/hr, not bad! I&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;m not sure of the time more specifically then because I met some very hospitable Canadians with beer and other fun on the summit.\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-NFn--PkYqWc/ULXH3s3j2uI/AAAAAAABhf4/-6fm0qiHV60/s2000/2008-08-03%2520-%252021%2520-%2520Mt%2520Victoria%2520from%2520Fairview.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-NFn--PkYqWc/ULXH3s3j2uI/AAAAAAABhf4/-6fm0qiHV60/s800/2008-08-03%2520-%252021%2520-%2520Mt%2520Victoria%2520from%2520Fairview.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Mt Victoria&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;table&gt;\r\n&lt;tbody&gt;\r\n&lt;tr&gt;\r\n&lt;td&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-z5UdENl6wjE/ULXH_62dTyI/AAAAAAABhg4/ih53ryV7vtM/s2000/2008-08-03%2520-%252040%2520-%2520More%2520Marmot.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-z5UdENl6wjE/ULXH_62dTyI/AAAAAAABhg4/ih53ryV7vtM/s280/2008-08-03%2520-%252040%2520-%2520More%2520Marmot.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;div style=\"text-align:center\"&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Marmot&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\r\n&lt;/td&gt;\r\n&lt;td&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-KP_ovb5iCAw/ULXH6FnKWhI/AAAAAAABhgQ/n0ZmGdBuDuU/s2000/2008-08-03%2520-%252030%2520-%2520NE%2520from%2520Fairview.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-KP_ovb5iCAw/ULXH6FnKWhI/AAAAAAABhgQ/n0ZmGdBuDuU/s280/2008-08-03%2520-%252030%2520-%2520NE%2520from%2520Fairview.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;div style=\"text-align:center\"&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;NE View&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\r\n&lt;/td&gt;\r\n&lt;td&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-2gBJTZgVhVQ/ULXIBOMOMbI/AAAAAAABhhI/ZM-qd9tO0Ak/s2000/2008-08-03%2520-%252042%2520-%2520Climbers%2520finishing%2520E%2520Ridge%2520on%2520Mt%2520Temple.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-2gBJTZgVhVQ/ULXIBOMOMbI/AAAAAAABhhI/ZM-qd9tO0Ak/s280/2008-08-03%2520-%252042%2520-%2520Climbers%2520finishing%2520E%2520Ridge%2520on%2520Mt%2520Temple.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;div style=\"text-align:center\"&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Climbers on Mt Temple\'s NE Ridge&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\r\n&lt;/td&gt;\r\n&lt;/tr&gt;\r\n&lt;/tbody&gt;\r\n&lt;/table&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\nThe guidebooks were spot on when they said that this summit had one of the best views in Banff National Park, and one of the best views per effort expended.  Fairview is an understated way to describe the summit. The views reminded me of those from Temple Crag in the California Palisades &amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#147; the peak itself isn&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;t grand, but it gives you an elevated, front-row 360 panorama of all of the larger peaks in the area. Hanging out on the summit I was even able to see climbers topping out on Mount Temple&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;s classic &lt;a href=\"http://www.summitpost.org/route/319166/east-ridge-iv-5-7.html\"&gt;East Ridge&lt;/a&gt;. \r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\nFrom the summit I could also seem some storm clouds brewing, so I headed down in haste to avoid the imminent rain shower. It was too late, as the first drops began falling on me just as I reached my bicycle.  By the time I began coasting downhill the rain picked up in ferocity and became a full on deluge.  I had come prepared, for this, though, and had donned a waterproof jacket and pants shell. However, since I had never done much cycling in the rain, it didn&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;t occur to me that my feet would need special rain protection. Between the water spraying off the road and tires, and the speed at which I was colliding with the rain drops, within a matter of minutes my shoes became saturated with cold water. Although the descent to the valley was only about 10 minutes, my feet were already numb by the time I made it down and out of the worst of the rain. \r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\nAlmost as suddenly as it had started, the thunderstorm stopped, allowing the last alpenglow of the day to cast its pink shine on Mt Temple. Although brief, the rainstorm was violent and had left me soaked and numb, revealing a serious deficiency in my cycling clothing.\r\n\r\n&lt;a name=\"Day7\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\r\n&lt;a name=\"WalterFeuzPk\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\r\n&lt;h2&gt;\r\n&lt;a name=\"TOC-Day-7-Lake-O-Hara-Environs---Lake-Louise-to-Lake-O-Hara\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Day 7 &amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#147; Lake O&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;Hara Environs - &lt;i&gt;Lake Louise to Lake O&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;Hara&lt;/i&gt;\r\n&lt;/h2&gt;\r\n&lt;hr&gt;\r\n&lt;table&gt;\r\n&lt;tbody&gt;\r\n&lt;tr&gt;\r\n&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-YLhujDSkqHM/ULXF3fDg77I/AAAAAAABhPg/JLEghrvhsFs/s2000/02b1%2520-%2520Lake%2520Louise%2520Area%2520-%2520Walter%2520Feuz%2520-%2520Route%2520Map.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-YLhujDSkqHM/ULXF3fDg77I/AAAAAAABhPg/JLEghrvhsFs/s400/02b1%2520-%2520Lake%2520Louise%2520Area%2520-%2520Walter%2520Feuz%2520-%2520Route%2520Map.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\r\n&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-i1IpIFNgPl4/ULXGKM07zLI/AAAAAAABhSY/ca9zSrg5UfQ/s2000/02b1%2520-%2520Lake%2520OHara1%2520Route%2520Profile.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-i1IpIFNgPl4/ULXGKM07zLI/AAAAAAABhSY/ca9zSrg5UfQ/s500/02b1%2520-%2520Lake%2520OHara1%2520Route%2520Profile.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\r\n&lt;/tr&gt;\r\n&lt;/tbody&gt;\r\n&lt;/table&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;u&gt;By Bike&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/b&gt;\r\n&lt;ul&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;Distance: 10.3 miles\r\n&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;Elevation Gain: 420 ft\r\n&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;/ul&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;u&gt;On Foot&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/b&gt;\r\n&lt;ul&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;Destinations: Walter Feuz Pk (9,348\'), MacArthur Lake\r\n&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;Distance: 10.6 miles\r\n&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;Elevation Gain: 4,500 ft\r\n&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;/ul&gt;\r\n\r\nToday was the day I was leaving Lake Louise to camp and hike in the Lake O\'Hara area. I was still set on climbing Mt Temple, which I hadn&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;t gotten to yet, so I planned to return for that before continuing West. I gave my farewells to Andre, who was great enough to not let me pay him my share for the campsite, and then I set off very early to make sure I made it to the pickup point in time for the shuttle.\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-Stn4n2Wj8zA/ULXGN5_kO_I/AAAAAAABhTI/SRpHkuq7z0Y/s2000/02b1%2520-%2520Lake%2520Louise%2520Area%2520-%2520Walter%2520Feuz%2520-%2520GE%2520Route%2520Map.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-Stn4n2Wj8zA/ULXGN5_kO_I/AAAAAAABhTI/SRpHkuq7z0Y/s800/02b1%2520-%2520Lake%2520Louise%2520Area%2520-%2520Walter%2520Feuz%2520-%2520GE%2520Route%2520Map.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\nLake O&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;Hara is in Yoho National Park, on the other side of the Continental Divide from Lake Louise. However, this was the most anti-climatic divide I have ever crossed. I had to gain an incredible 420 vertical feet over a vast 8 miles, so this would require all of my patience to not get bored. Along the way I saw some other touring cyclists heading the other way on the highway, coming from Jasper National Park (the only other touring cyclists I would actually see on the road on my trip, oddly enough.) The final few miles up to the pass were memorable for me as it was like riding some kind of stagecoach or galloping horse. About every 15 feet there was an expansion joint in the road, giving me a mild bump. The bumps were small and regular enough that it created a kind of &amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#156;thump-thump . . .  thump-thump . . . thump-thump . . .&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#157; that lasted all the way to the summit.\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\nI rode very carefully on the final quarter mile to the pickup, as it was on a bumpy dirt road and I was terrified of breaking my rear rack. I made it to the stop with plenty of time to pack up my gear off of my bike and get it ready for transport. I met a number of other nice travelers there from all walks of life, and one person who offered me some great advice for returning. Although the campsite reservations often fill up 6 months in advance, it is common for cancellations to occur within a week of the reservation due to unforeseen events, so one can reasonably count on getting lucky looking for a spot less than a week before the scheduled time.  Soon the bus arrived, and the ranger and truck that would take my bike up. I delivered the bike and some thank-you chocolates for the favor they were doing me (since bikes technically weren&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;t allowed up there) and we were off.\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;table&gt;\r\n&lt;tbody&gt;\r\n&lt;tr&gt;\r\n&lt;td&gt;\r\n&lt;div style=\"text-align:center\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-y9r0VBSLrKM/ULXIFA4IiFI/AAAAAAABhho/s5mcU35T44w/s2000/2008-08-04%2520-%252008%2520-%2520Transcontinental%2520Divide.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-y9r0VBSLrKM/ULXIFA4IiFI/AAAAAAABhho/s5mcU35T44w/s400/2008-08-04%2520-%252008%2520-%2520Transcontinental%2520Divide.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;\r\n&lt;div style=\"text-align:center\"&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;The extremely steep continental divide&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\r\n&lt;/b&gt;\r\n&lt;/td&gt;\r\n&lt;td&gt;\r\n&lt;div style=\"text-align:center\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-24HDkuCEABA/ULXIGunQ7nI/AAAAAAABhhw/G_jwbCrWplw/s2000/2008-08-04%2520-%252009%2520-%2520Wiwaxy%2520Pk.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-24HDkuCEABA/ULXIGunQ7nI/AAAAAAABhhw/G_jwbCrWplw/s400/2008-08-04%2520-%252009%2520-%2520Wiwaxy%2520Pk.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;\r\n&lt;div style=\"text-align:center\"&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Wiwaxy Peak&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\r\n&lt;/b&gt;\r\n&lt;/td&gt;\r\n&lt;/tr&gt;\r\n&lt;tr&gt;\r\n&lt;td&gt;\r\n&lt;div style=\"text-align:center\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-cWjRcO5Dhp8/ULXIHwIAtoI/AAAAAAABhh4/iWXj5YFnKX8/s2000/2008-08-04%2520-%252011%2520-%2520Mt%2520Huber.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-cWjRcO5Dhp8/ULXIHwIAtoI/AAAAAAABhh4/iWXj5YFnKX8/s400/2008-08-04%2520-%252011%2520-%2520Mt%2520Huber.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;\r\n&lt;div style=\"text-align:center\"&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Mt Huber&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\r\n&lt;/b&gt;\r\n&lt;/td&gt;\r\n&lt;td&gt;\r\n&lt;div style=\"text-align:center\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-wH1fZPpAznU/ULXIJL67S5I/AAAAAAABhiA/MzpgCX9Yat4/s2000/2008-08-04%2520-%252014%2520-%2520The%2520Goodsirs%2520from%2520McArthur%2520Pass.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-wH1fZPpAznU/ULXIJL67S5I/AAAAAAABhiA/MzpgCX9Yat4/s400/2008-08-04%2520-%252014%2520-%2520The%2520Goodsirs%2520from%2520McArthur%2520Pass.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;\r\n&lt;div style=\"text-align:center\"&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Goodsirs&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\r\n&lt;/b&gt;\r\n&lt;/td&gt;\r\n&lt;/tr&gt;\r\n&lt;/tbody&gt;\r\n&lt;/table&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\nOnce I made it to the campsite I quickly set up, ate lunch and took off. I would only have the last 3/4 of the day here, and another half day tomorrow before the shuttle took me back, and I wanted to make the most of my time in the area. The first place I headed to was McArthur Pass in order to get a view of the Goodsirs. In some earlier Google Earth reconnaissance for the trip I couldn&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;t help but notice these gigantic peaks towering over the area. A quick spot check revealed the north faces rise nearly vertical over 4,500 ft from the glaciers at the base to the summit! I could see from topo maps that I should have line of site to the peaks from the pass. \r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\nThe pass provided stellar views of the peaks, but more was to come. The Highline Trail, which split off here, went higher up some mountain slopes, but through a protected area. The area was currently open to only 10 people each day, and there was still space for me, so I wandered up to get some higher views of the area. I neared some cliffs where the maps showed the trail ending, and seeing a use trail and cairns continuing, I continued climbing.\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-ry-_4OJFK4I/ULXFfRcLn_I/AAAAAAABhMY/g7zfuzhAHXA/s2000/2008-08-05%2520-%252043%2520-%2520Walter%2520Feuz%2520%2526%2520Odaray%2520Pks%2520Label.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-ry-_4OJFK4I/ULXFfRcLn_I/AAAAAAABhMY/g7zfuzhAHXA/s800/2008-08-05%2520-%252043%2520-%2520Walter%2520Feuz%2520%2526%2520Odaray%2520Pks%2520Label.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;SE Ridge of Walter Feuz&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\nAtop the cliffs where a series of rock plateaus and talus piles, and I kept following the cairns higher. Finally I reached a high point at the base of a ridge spur coming off of the main peak and sat down to enjoy the views. I didn&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;t plan to go higher, since I had no guide for the area, no idea what peak this was or what routes were on it, and from here it looked like 3rd class scrambling with a vertical 200 ft headwall stopping the ridge. Ridgeline cornices also looked huge, and something I didn&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;t want to tangle with solo &amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#147; but wait! In the opening between two cornices I saw some climbers pass. I could follow their tracks, and their scale showed that the cornices weren&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;t as large as though, and the summit not as high as though. \r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-6_QfG2U-mxg/ULXIVdReJ3I/AAAAAAABhjg/Wi4PFwdF5pU/s2000/2008-08-04%2520-%252042%2520-%2520The%2520Goodsirs%2520from%2520Feuz%2520summit.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-6_QfG2U-mxg/ULXIVdReJ3I/AAAAAAABhjg/Wi4PFwdF5pU/s800/2008-08-04%2520-%252042%2520-%2520The%2520Goodsirs%2520from%2520Feuz%2520summit.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Goodsirs from Walter Feuz&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;table&gt;\r\n&lt;tbody&gt;\r\n&lt;tr&gt;\r\n&lt;td&gt;\r\n&lt;div style=\"text-align:center\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-yfSgnpfhUYs/ULXIUqMJt2I/AAAAAAABhjY/_tTywvQKUyE/s2000/2008-08-04%2520-%252041%2520-%2520Pk%2520in%2520Kootenay.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-yfSgnpfhUYs/ULXIUqMJt2I/AAAAAAABhjY/_tTywvQKUyE/s400/2008-08-04%2520-%252041%2520-%2520Pk%2520in%2520Kootenay.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;\r\n&lt;div style=\"text-align:center\"&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Peaks in Kootenay from summit&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\r\n&lt;/b&gt;\r\n&lt;/td&gt;\r\n&lt;td&gt;\r\n&lt;div style=\"text-align:center\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-mML6t-RkzRA/ULXIMg41X5I/AAAAAAABhiY/wm9ak80wlzo/s2000/2008-08-04%2520-%252028%2520-%2520Ridge%2520between%2520Bosworth%2520%2526%2520Paget%2520Pk.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-mML6t-RkzRA/ULXIMg41X5I/AAAAAAABhiY/wm9ak80wlzo/s400/2008-08-04%2520-%252028%2520-%2520Ridge%2520between%2520Bosworth%2520%2526%2520Paget%2520Pk.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;\r\n&lt;div style=\"text-align:center\"&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Bosworth &amp;amp; Paget Pk Ridge&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\r\n&lt;/b&gt;\r\n&lt;/td&gt;\r\n&lt;/tr&gt;\r\n&lt;tr&gt;\r\n&lt;td&gt;\r\n&lt;div style=\"text-align:center\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-9gvQFTjoG6w/ULXIQ2LfyqI/AAAAAAABhi4/uQeMWcH1iMI/s2000/2008-08-04%2520-%252034%2520-%2520The%2520Goodsirs.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-9gvQFTjoG6w/ULXIQ2LfyqI/AAAAAAABhi4/uQeMWcH1iMI/s400/2008-08-04%2520-%252034%2520-%2520The%2520Goodsirs.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;\r\n&lt;div style=\"text-align:center\"&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Goodsirs &amp;amp; Yoho&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\r\n&lt;/b&gt;\r\n&lt;/td&gt;\r\n&lt;td&gt;\r\n&lt;div style=\"text-align:center\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-Lcz-BTKnp_E/ULXIJ8RZgkI/AAAAAAABhiI/VrjRks1BDdo/s2000/2008-08-04%2520-%252024%2520-%2520Ringrose%2520Pk%2520Hungabee%2520Mtn.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-Lcz-BTKnp_E/ULXIJ8RZgkI/AAAAAAABhiI/VrjRks1BDdo/s400/2008-08-04%2520-%252024%2520-%2520Ringrose%2520Pk%2520Hungabee%2520Mtn.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;\r\n&lt;div style=\"text-align:center\"&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Ringrose &amp;amp; Hungabee Mtn&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\r\n&lt;/b&gt;\r\n&lt;/td&gt;\r\n&lt;/tr&gt;\r\n&lt;/tbody&gt;\r\n&lt;/table&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;div&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;/div&gt;\r\n\r\nFiguring they came up my way, I continued up towards the main ridge. Here I scrambled on the best rock I encountered in the Rockies. It was surprisingly solid rock on delightful third class on the spur. At the headwall, I found a series of ledges that zig-zagged across the face, keeping difficulties low, and before I knew it, after a short steep snow headwall, I was at the top. The backside was completely melted out except for the cornices, so the final bit was a breeze. I passed the climbers, now descending from the summit. They were a group being led by a guide from the Alpine Club of Canada (ACA), who were staying at some club cabins at Lake O&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;Hara. They told me the peak I climbed was called Walter Feuz (or Little Odaray, since it was a smaller summit on a massif with the higher and more technical Odaray Pk). Also, there was a peak across the way above Lake McArthur, Shaffer Ridge, and they pointed out to me that you could see climbers from another party of theirs scrambling up it. It apparently had good rock and reasonable route finding too, so I made a note to go for it after stopping by McArthur Lake.\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-ZJyt4uxmb1s/ULXIW-ckuEI/AAAAAAABhjo/lq-QQEZtDjE/s2000/2008-08-04%2520-%252056%2520-%2520Lake%2520McArthur%2520area.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-ZJyt4uxmb1s/ULXIW-ckuEI/AAAAAAABhjo/lq-QQEZtDjE/s800/2008-08-04%2520-%252056%2520-%2520Lake%2520McArthur%2520area.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;McArthur Lake&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\nThe summit provided breathtaking panoramas of the Lake O&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;Hara area, and an unobstructed view of the Goodsirs. To the south, Mt Assiniboine still looked surprisingly close.  As I descended, I was struck by how varied and unusual the rock was in the area. Unlike the rest of the Rockies encountered so far, this rock was much more solid. Also, a lot of it didn&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;t appear to be limestone.\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-5u7MCUKWzCw/ULXIfTS99aI/AAAAAAABhkg/AkgVWikRMFs/s2000/2008-08-04%2520-%252064%2520-%2520Mtn%2520Goat.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-5u7MCUKWzCw/ULXIfTS99aI/AAAAAAABhkg/AkgVWikRMFs/s800/2008-08-04%2520-%252064%2520-%2520Mtn%2520Goat.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Mountain Goat &amp;amp; Baby&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\nI caught up with the climbing party at the snow headwall, where the guide was setting up a boot axe belay to belay the other climbers down. I thought this odd since the headwall was only about 40 degrees, no higher than 50 ft, and had a nice gradual runout and plenty of rock slab and boulders before the cliff, so falling on it wouldn&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;t lead to any injuring. I leapt down the way, glissading with my axe, holstered my axe between my back and pack, and quickly scrambled back down the cliff, which oddly enough, was easier descending than ascending (maybe it was a stress of uncertainty thing?). Once I made it to the base of the scrambling, I looked up to see the climbers still descending the upper snowfield.&amp;Acirc;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\nA fast and short hike later brought me to Lake McArthur, which I would say has got to be one of the prettiest lakes I had ever seen. The lake is hemmed in on two sides by tall steep cliffs. These cliffs dramatically coalesce into the massive and fairly symmetric form of Mt Biddle, which looked like a classic Alpine peak. The lake was an unreal blue green, completely opaque and glass smooth. Along the shore was lush green short grass and rock slab perfect for lounging. If I&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;m ever back in the area, I will have to make sure to spend an entire day just hanging out here!\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-BdSxg1ds4Do/ULXIlDcOrdI/AAAAAAABhlY/S50q-FWyDgI/s2000/2008-08-04%2520-%252078%2520-%2520Lake%2520McArthur%2520%2526%2520Mt%2520Biddle.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-BdSxg1ds4Do/ULXIlDcOrdI/AAAAAAABhlY/S50q-FWyDgI/s800/2008-08-04%2520-%252078%2520-%2520Lake%2520McArthur%2520%2526%2520Mt%2520Biddle.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Lake McArthur &amp;amp; Mt Biddle&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\nAs I speed hiked over to the route on Shaffer Ridge, I ran into the ACA climbers on their way back to their cabins. They commented at their surprise at how fast and effortlessly I descended Walter Feuz, and were surprised to hear that I had gone by Lake McArthur on my way here. I my monster dayhikes and scrambles in the Sierra with other speed demons has had an effect on me.&amp;Acirc;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\nLast was a steep headwall to gain the base of the ridge. A trail climbs this as it loops over a shoulder in the ridge and continues up the neighboring canyon. There I met two hikers from Chicago. The daylight seemed to be fading fast, and the ridge to summit Shaffer looked longer and more complex than expected, so I took in the excellent views of Lake O&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;Hara and then took advantage of some rare company and hiked down with my new companions just in time for sunset.\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;table&gt;\r\n&lt;tbody&gt;\r\n&lt;tr&gt;\r\n&lt;td style=\"text-align:center\"&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-cvK9qozBxy4/ULXIiDuP5xI/AAAAAAABhlA/xfM0Vm-hY-Y/s2000/2008-08-04%2520-%252072%2520-%2520Mtn%2520Flower.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-cvK9qozBxy4/ULXIiDuP5xI/AAAAAAABhlA/xfM0Vm-hY-Y/s280/2008-08-04%2520-%252072%2520-%2520Mtn%2520Flower.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;/td&gt;\r\n&lt;td&gt;\r\n&lt;div style=\"text-align:center\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-lhLxXGR18NE/ULXIPHSxN6I/AAAAAAABhio/b8JloxgL7zM/s2000/2008-08-04%2520-%252031%2520-%2520Lake%2520OHara%2520area.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-lhLxXGR18NE/ULXIPHSxN6I/AAAAAAABhio/b8JloxgL7zM/s280/2008-08-04%2520-%252031%2520-%2520Lake%2520OHara%2520area.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;\r\n&lt;div style=\"text-align:center\"&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Lake O\'Hara Area&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\r\n&lt;/b&gt;\r\n&lt;/td&gt;\r\n&lt;td&gt;\r\n&lt;div style=\"text-align:center\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-UsCpg5wxhnA/ULXISzzi--I/AAAAAAABhjI/1A-FMkIT5As/s2000/2008-08-04%2520-%252039%2520-%2520Mt%2520Assiniboine%2520from%2520Walter%2520Feuz.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-UsCpg5wxhnA/ULXISzzi--I/AAAAAAABhjI/1A-FMkIT5As/s280/2008-08-04%2520-%252039%2520-%2520Mt%2520Assiniboine%2520from%2520Walter%2520Feuz.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;\r\n&lt;div style=\"text-align:center\"&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Mt Assiniboine&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\r\n&lt;/b&gt;\r\n&lt;/td&gt;\r\n&lt;/tr&gt;\r\n&lt;tr&gt;\r\n&lt;td&gt;\r\n&lt;div style=\"text-align:center\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-UzyDDAdUBVs/ULXInZ7zD9I/AAAAAAABhlo/hkzElgl372I/s2000/2008-08-04%2520-%252083%2520-%2520Opabin%2520Pass.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-UzyDDAdUBVs/ULXInZ7zD9I/AAAAAAABhlo/hkzElgl372I/s280/2008-08-04%2520-%252083%2520-%2520Opabin%2520Pass.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;\r\n&lt;div style=\"text-align:center\"&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Opabin pass&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\r\n&lt;/b&gt;\r\n&lt;/td&gt;\r\n&lt;td&gt;\r\n&lt;div style=\"text-align:center\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-YnTRManJhZM/ULXIpjG8y_I/AAAAAAABhl4/KIzlaVsv1f0/s2000/2008-08-04%2520-%252090%2520-%2520Lake%2520OHara%2520%2526%2520Wiwaxy%2520Pks.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-YnTRManJhZM/ULXIpjG8y_I/AAAAAAABhl4/KIzlaVsv1f0/s280/2008-08-04%2520-%252090%2520-%2520Lake%2520OHara%2520%2526%2520Wiwaxy%2520Pks.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;\r\n&lt;div style=\"text-align:center\"&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Lake O\'Hara &amp;amp;

I had to hurry, since the afternoon shuttle out of the area left at 4:30 pm. On the agenda today was to hike up the steep switchbacks to Wiwaxy Gap and traverse down and over to Lake Oesa.

I made the 1,700 ft climb to the pass in 45 minutes, where I took in the panoramic views of Lake O&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;Hara and the surrounding peaks.

Take one of the &amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#156;alpine routes&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#157; labeled on maps and you will follow trails through terrain that looks impassable to hiking with only the occasional class 2 up or down climb. Such was the case as I traversed and descended to Lake Oesa across terrain that normally would be slow and tedious travel.\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;table&gt;\r\n&lt;tbody&gt;\r\n&lt;tr&gt;\r\n&lt;td&gt;\r\n&lt;div style=\"text-align:center\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-7UWOE5jdnzU/ULXIub2gMoI/AAAAAAABhmo/H6MmyWmt0qs/s2000/2008-08-05%2520-%252004%2520-%2520Alpine%2520Ledges%2520route.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-7UWOE5jdnzU/ULXIub2gMoI/AAAAAAABhmo/H6MmyWmt0qs/s280/2008-08-05%2520-%252004%2520-%2520Alpine%2520Ledges%2520route.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;\r\n&lt;div style=\"text-align:center\"&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Alpine Ledges Route&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\r\n&lt;/b&gt;\r\n&lt;/td&gt;\r\n&lt;td&gt;\r\n&lt;div style=\"text-align:center\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-DcrK18Dj0CU/ULXIyJLAvoI/AAAAAAABhnI/yCrxXAN3zvA/s2000/2008-08-05%2520-%252017%2520-%2520Wiwaxy%2520Gap%2520trail.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-DcrK18Dj0CU/ULXIyJLAvoI/AAAAAAABhnI/yCrxXAN3zvA/s280/2008-08-05%2520-%252017%2520-%2520Wiwaxy%2520Gap%2520trail.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;\r\n&lt;div style=\"text-align:center\"&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Wiwaxy Gap trail&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\r\n&lt;/b&gt;\r\n&lt;/td&gt;\r\n&lt;td&gt;\r\n&lt;div style=\"text-align:center\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/--GqzoAdeTpY/ULXIzXxGfSI/AAAAAAABhnQ/-jqnozFumrA/s2000/2008-08-05%2520-%252020%2520-%2520Wiwaxy%2520Gap.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/--GqzoAdeTpY/ULXIzXxGfSI/AAAAAAABhnQ/-jqnozFumrA/s280/2008-08-05%2520-%252020%2520-%2520Wiwaxy%2520Gap.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;\r\n&lt;div style=\"text-align:center\"&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Wiwaxy Gap&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\r\n&lt;/b&gt;\r\n&lt;/td&gt;\r\n&lt;/tr&gt;\r\n&lt;tr&gt;\r\n&lt;td&gt;\r\n&lt;div style=\"text-align:center\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-TnNa074_VMc/ULXI5sAWQpI/AAAAAAABhn4/B1tTRCNFX5g/s2000/2008-08-05%2520-%252028%2520-%2520LeFroy%2520from%2520Abbot%2520Pass.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-TnNa074_VMc/ULXI5sAWQpI/AAAAAAABhn4/B1tTRCNFX5g/s280/2008-08-05%2520-%252028%2520-%2520LeFroy%2520from%2520Abbot%2520Pass.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;\r\n&lt;div style=\"text-align:center\"&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;LeFroy from Abbot Pass&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\r\n&lt;/b&gt;\r\n&lt;/td&gt;\r\n&lt;td&gt;\r\n&lt;div style=\"text-align:center\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-FxqdmuTIrHI/ULXI_nLGtiI/AAAAAAABhog/ozVikDMlLMI/s2000/2008-08-05%2520-%252034%2520-%2520Abbot%2520Hut%2520at%2520Abbot%2520Pass.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-FxqdmuTIrHI/ULXI_nLGtiI/AAAAAAABhog/ozVikDMlLMI/s280/2008-08-05%2520-%252034%2520-%2520Abbot%2520Hut%2520at%2520Abbot%2520Pass.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;\r\n&lt;div style=\"text-align:center\"&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Abbot Pass Mtn Hut&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\r\n&lt;/b&gt;\r\n&lt;/td&gt;\r\n&lt;td&gt;\r\n&lt;div style=\"text-align:center\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-1CiwbA54cDk/ULXI3li7nAI/AAAAAAABhno/SeTP9VUzINI/s2000/2008-08-05%2520-%252025%2520-%2520Coloir%2520to%2520Abbot%2520Pass.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-1CiwbA54cDk/ULXI3li7nAI/AAAAAAABhno/SeTP9VUzINI/s280/2008-08-05%2520-%252025%2520-%2520Coloir%2520to%2520Abbot%2520Pass.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;\r\n&lt;div style=\"text-align:center\"&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Screeee!&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\r\n&lt;/b&gt;\r\n&lt;/td&gt;\r\n&lt;/tr&gt;\r\n&lt;/tbody&gt;\r\n&lt;/table&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\nI made it to the small blue lake situated picturesquely beneath Ringrose Peak by 12:30. So far so good, as it seemed I had enough time to run up to Abbot Pass. From here there is a steep and horrendously loose 2,000 ft couloir to the pass. There are some use-trails that make the going a tad easier, but I still had to travel very cautiously to avoid knocking lots of rocks down. \r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\nBy 1:50 I had made it to the Hut. I had reached it just as a guided climbing party was getting back from a successful ascent of neighboring Mt LeFroy. It looked so close! After hearing that it only took them 4 hours round trip to summit via a short but of 5.4 climbing, I longed for a climbing partner and rope, but alas I would have to do without. The Pass is well worth a visit, both for views of the O&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;Hara area and also back down towards Lake Louise on the other side. It was quite surreal to be looking down at Valley of the 6 Glaciers, which I was at only 2 days ago, seemingly so far away.\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\nBecause there are virtually no mountain huts in the mountain ranges of the U.S., and the few there are usually small aluminum shacks, I had to check this place out. While the mountaineers enjoyed tea and cake, they let me wander around inside the luxurious stone shelter. Inside I was surprised to find: beds, books, board games, kitchen with stove, etc. Imagining approaching to this shelter, spending the night here, and having a 4 hr round trip summit seemed incredibly deluxe to me &amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#147; quite a world apart from most mountaineering in the U.S.\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\nI started back down the chute at about the same time as the other climbers. Although I started first, I moved slowly, taking care not to knock down loose rocks. The quickly caught up as the guide knew of a parallel chute that people do not ascend, that has scree the perfect diameter for scree skiing. Noticing their way down, I joined for a fun descent. Once we slowed down and began a descending traverse, suddenly the terrain around me shifted all at once (strangely reminiscent of the time I knocked down the SE face of Mt Wallace during the &lt;a href=\"http://www.snwburd.com/bob/trip_reports/haeckel_1.html\"&gt;2004 Sierra Challenge!&lt;/a&gt;). A microwave-size boulder about 20 ft above me began to roll, and I quickly moved aside and shouted &amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#156;rock!&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#157; The climbers near me moved away easily enough, but there was a moment of drama as the guide, who had descended much further down, waited in anticipation as the boulder crashed down toward hum. It bounced left and right and he anticipated correctly, jumping the correct way just in time to avoid it. I was happy to be off this slope.\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;table&gt;\r\n&lt;tbody&gt;\r\n&lt;tr&gt;\r\n&lt;td&gt;\r\n&lt;div style=\"text-align:center\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-AVvHAaLawOE/ULXI4S40_zI/AAAAAAABhnw/k5Su8Yu6FZM/s2000/2008-08-05%2520-%252027%2520-%2520Mt%2520Biddle.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-AVvHAaLawOE/ULXI4S40_zI/AAAAAAABhnw/k5Su8Yu6FZM/s280/2008-08-05%2520-%252027%2520-%2520Mt%2520Biddle.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;\r\n&lt;div style=\"text-align:center\"&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Biddle from Abbot Pass&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\r\n&lt;/b&gt;\r\n&lt;/td&gt;\r\n&lt;td&gt;\r\n&lt;div style=\"text-align:center\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-fyTF50yAkNg/ULXJPy3GWXI/AAAAAAABhqY/2nLf-HKwnOg/s2000/2008-08-05%2520-%252050%2520-%2520Mt%2520Biddle.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-fyTF50yAkNg/ULXJPy3GWXI/AAAAAAABhqY/2nLf-HKwnOg/s280/2008-08-05%2520-%252050%2520-%2520Mt%2520Biddle.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;\r\n&lt;div style=\"text-align:center\"&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Mt Biddle and Schaffer Ridge&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\r\n&lt;/b&gt;\r\n&lt;/td&gt;\r\n&lt;td style=\"text-align:center\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-iRDHC0ESFOE/ULXJMIZ5PcI/AAAAAAABhpw/5V-ZLvk9Y30/s2000/2008-08-05%2520-%252045%2520-%2520Cool%2520plants.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-iRDHC0ESFOE/ULXJMIZ5PcI/AAAAAAABhpw/5V-ZLvk9Y30/s280/2008-08-05%2520-%252045%2520-%2520Cool%2520plants.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\r\n&lt;/tr&gt;\r\n&lt;tr&gt;\r\n&lt;td&gt;\r\n&lt;div style=\"text-align:center\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-miakO7bjXvU/ULXJF5QZ4-I/AAAAAAABhpA/IR_tfO9WGqQ/s2000/2008-08-05%2520-%252038%2520-%2520Stone%2520trail%2520w%2520bridge.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-miakO7bjXvU/ULXJF5QZ4-I/AAAAAAABhpA/IR_tfO9WGqQ/s280/2008-08-05%2520-%252038%2520-%2520Stone%2520trail%2520w%2520bridge.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;\r\n&lt;div style=\"text-align:center\"&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Stone path&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\r\n&lt;/b&gt;\r\n&lt;/td&gt;\r\n&lt;td&gt;\r\n&lt;div style=\"text-align:center\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-kBPft63RJVo/ULXJHGiyoiI/AAAAAAABhpI/m8-j4W_nevs/s2000/2008-08-05%2520-%252039%2520-%2520Stone%2520trail.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-kBPft63RJVo/ULXJHGiyoiI/AAAAAAABhpI/m8-j4W_nevs/s280/2008-08-05%2520-%252039%2520-%2520Stone%2520trail.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;\r\n&lt;div style=\"text-align:center\"&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Stone path&'),(17,148,'/mountaineering/trip-reports/canada/cycling-and-scrambling-from-calgary-to-vancouver/part-iii---mishaps-in-the-middle-ranges','Part III - Mishaps in the Middle Ranges','Part III - Mishaps in the Middle Ranges','Trip_Report','content: &lt;div dir=\"ltr\"&gt;\r\n&lt;h1&gt;\r\n&lt;a name=\"TOC-Part-III---Mishaps-in-the-Middle-Ranges\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Part III - Mishaps in the Middle Ranges &lt;/h1&gt;\r\n&lt;hr&gt;\r\n&lt;hr&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;a href=\"#Day10\"&gt;Day 10 &amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#147;

I expected an easy, straightforward 19 mile ride today &amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#147; no tricky business. Today I would be traveling extra heavy, since with all of the free beer contributed by the pariahs, I still had 5 bottles of beer. Unable to throw them away, I stuffed them in my rear panniers for the ride.\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\nAn ample breakfast in Lake Louise later, and then I was off! My stay in the Canadian Rockies was coming to an end and finally I would be continuing on my cycling route in earnest (apart from plans to bag one more peak near Field). The skin on my left thigh was finally peeling from nasty sunburn I got on my first long day of riding (that leg faced south, and I learned the hard way that cycling pants are excellent at chafing off sunscreen). I departed with my feet still torn up, swelling up in my shoes, and an ample supply of gallon ziplock bags (my answer to the rain-soaking problem for my shoes).\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\nCresting the pass, I was disappointed to find a very strong headwind blowing up the pass. I had expected a fun fast ride down the steep drop to Field, but the winds were so strong that even on a 5% downgrade, I had to pedal hard downhill to barely sustain a 15 mph speed. Midway down the canyon I stopped at an excellent overlook of one of the more interesting sections of the transcontinental railroad, where two spiral tunnels had been built in a figure-8 linkup into the mountainsides to maintain a lower (but still very steep) grade for the train tracks. Before the spiral tunnels had been built, the grade was so steep (4.5%) that it was a common occurrence for trains to become runaway and crash somewhere down the canyon or into Field. The tunnels have since made the stretch a manageable and safe 2.2%.&amp;Acirc;&amp;nbsp;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"http://www.engrailhistory.info/r112.html\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"http://www.engrailhistory.info/imfile/x00020.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Map of the railroad spiral tunnels (from&amp;Acirc;&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=\"http://www.engrailhistory.info/r112.html\"&gt;http://www.engrailhistory.info/r112.html&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;\r\n\r\nThe overlook also had some nice models of the arrangement, and some nice informative signs of the area. For example, I learned that the continental divide here was called &lt;a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kicking_Horse_Pass\"&gt;&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#156;Kicking Horse Pass&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#157;&lt;/a&gt; in honor of the horse that kicked one of the first white men to explore the region. Also, the pass was one of many considered for the transcontinental railroad.\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\nI continued downhill into the strong headwind. Although mildly annoyed by the wind, I still thoroughly enjoyed myself as the mountains rose ever higher above me as I plummeted 1,400 feet into the valley below. The road abruptly flattens at the bottom, where it reaches the valley bottom and turns sharply cross-canyon to cross the flood plains, and it was here that the shit hit the fan. I learned a very interesting lesson for later cycle tours:\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;Strong winds + deep canyon = Very strong down-canyon winds at the bottom\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\nStrong winds + deep canyon + turning across canyon = very very strong cross-winds\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\nStrong winds + deep canyon + turning across canyon + narrow shoulder on river bridge crossing + semi-trucks = very very strong cross winds with very very strong turbulence and suction superposed = SUDDEN NEAR LOSS OF CONTROL OF BICYCLE\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\nNear loss of control + narrow shoulder + semi-trucks honking = NEARLY SHITTING PANTS&lt;/b&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"http://www.engrailhistory.info/r112.html\" style=\"text-align:-webkit-center\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"http://www.engrailhistory.info/imfile/x00020.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br style=\"text-align:-webkit-center\"&gt;\r\n&lt;b style=\"text-align:-webkit-center\"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Add diagram of road, trucks, wind etc. for near accident&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\nBasically, when the road suddenly turned across the canyon, I had to fight very hard to not topple over, leaning heavily into the wind. This occurred right when the shoulder narrowed as I entered the viaduct crossing the river, forcing me close to the fog line. This happened moments before a semi-truck came behind me. The front blast of pressure from the semi forced me to lean harder into the wind to avoid getting knocked over into the shoulder. Then the suction came, which with the fast flowing cross wind, was itself exaggerated.  The suction came so fast that I didn&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;t have a chance to stop leaning towards the semi when suddenly I was sucked very hard towards it. I jerked hard away from the semi to avoid falling into the road just before the tail-wind turbulence and the resumption of the cross-wind hit me, causing me to swerve left and right as I tried to control the weight of my rig while fighting the cross-wind. Another semi was right behind the one that caused me to nearly lose control, and this one blared its horn, scaring the shit out of me while I was trying to regain control and going through the whole blast, suction, turbulence, cross-wind blast cycle again.\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\nThe viaduct crossing probably only lasted a minute, but it felt like an eternity as I regained control and composure while battling the cross-winds and traffic winds. FINALLY I reached the other side, the shoulders widened, and I turned back into the headwind. WHEW!!!!\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\nIn a daze I cycled over to the walk-in campground I had planned to spend the night in, finding it very open and exposed to the wind, dust blowing everywhere. It was also completely empty. I found a small campsite protected in the trees (no car access), made myself at home, drank my 5 beers to celebrate life, and fell asleep utterly exhausted.\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;table&gt;\r\n&lt;tbody&gt;\r\n&lt;tr&gt;\r\n&lt;td&gt;\r\n&lt;div style=\"text-align:center\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-f0csorb_B1c/ULXECoSFQgI/AAAAAAABhDo/V7c8F217jwQ/s2000/2008-08-07%2520-%252005%2520-%2520Mt%2520Stephen.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-f0csorb_B1c/ULXECoSFQgI/AAAAAAABhDo/V7c8F217jwQ/s400/2008-08-07%2520-%252005%2520-%2520Mt%2520Stephen.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\r\n&lt;div style=\"text-align:center\"&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Mt Stephen towering above the valley&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\r\n&lt;/td&gt;\r\n&lt;td&gt;\r\n&lt;div style=\"text-align:center\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-tFNKeTRukSk/ULXEJ2GsMPI/AAAAAAABhEg/SMDJwiLfLH8/s2000/2008-08-08-%252001%2520-%2520Kicking%2520Horse%2520River%2520looking%2520E.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-tFNKeTRukSk/ULXEJ2GsMPI/AAAAAAABhEg/SMDJwiLfLH8/s400/2008-08-08-%252001%2520-%2520Kicking%2520Horse%2520River%2520looking%2520E.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\r\n&lt;div style=\"text-align:center\"&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;The river plains near Field&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\r\n&lt;/td&gt;\r\n&lt;/tr&gt;\r\n&lt;/tbody&gt;\r\n&lt;/table&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;h2&gt;Day 11 &amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#147; Sleeping In - &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Field to Golden&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;a name=\"Day11\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\r\n&lt;/h2&gt;\r\n&lt;hr&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-uaujksgJdiA/ULXF76WPlzI/AAAAAAABhQc/MUgthz_BI-s/s2000/04%2520-%2520Field-Golden%2520-%2520Route%2520Map.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-uaujksgJdiA/ULXF76WPlzI/AAAAAAABhQc/MUgthz_BI-s/s800/04%2520-%2520Field-Golden%2520-%2520Route%2520Map.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;table&gt;\r\n&lt;tbody&gt;\r\n&lt;tr&gt;\r\n&lt;td&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-ojvM1xy8MSU/ULXF7AGN7tI/AAAAAAABhQU/gyy4VsBnvyM/s2000/04%2520-%2520Field%2520to%2520Golden%2520Route%2520Profile.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-ojvM1xy8MSU/ULXF7AGN7tI/AAAAAAABhQU/gyy4VsBnvyM/s800/04%2520-%2520Field%2520to%2520Golden%2520Route%2520Profile.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;/td&gt;\r\n&lt;/tr&gt;\r\n&lt;/tbody&gt;\r\n&lt;/table&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;u&gt;By Bike:&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/b&gt;\r\n&lt;ul&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;Distance: 38.9 miles\r\n&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;Elevation Gain: 1,580 ft\r\n&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;/ul&gt;\r\n\r\nToday&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;s plan:  Hike/scramble Mt Field and Mt Burgess.\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\nTomorrow&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;s Plan: Cycle from Field through Golden to a campground in Glacier National Park\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\nToday&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;s reality: Slept in until 11am, woke up feeling very out of it\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\nTime to change plans. As it was too late and I was too tired to climb more peaks today, I decided to break up my cycling days a little differently. Using my hand spreadsheet chart to see distances and elevation gain of different combinations, I decided to break up my ride, and make use of today to cycle to Golden and spend the night there. Then I could skip the campground in Glacier and cycle all the way to Revelstoke, with further shifts in my plans beyond that.\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\nAs I prepared to leave the campground, I saw another cyclist sitting in the back of his truck, prepping his bike for a ride. Coincidentally, he was from Golden and had driven out here to cycle back for a good ride. He gave me some helpful beta for the day&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;s ride, and for the road beyond Golden &amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#147; luckily everything sounded pretty hunky-dory to me. He even gave me an excellent recommendation for breakfast in Field &amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#147; the Stuffed Pig.\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-E--fCiNWDSo/ULXEERh0JqI/AAAAAAABhD4/YyrzchDZwlA/s2000/2008-08-08%2520-%252004%2520-%2520Mt%2520Stephen%2520from%2520Field.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-E--fCiNWDSo/ULXEERh0JqI/AAAAAAABhD4/YyrzchDZwlA/s800/2008-08-08%2520-%252004%2520-%2520Mt%2520Stephen%2520from%2520Field.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Mt Stephen rising 6,000 ft above Field&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\nI found the Stuffed Pig easily enough, and feeling weak and famished (probably not eating enough calories), attempted to stuff myself like a pig while enjoying the breathtaking north face of Mt Stephen rising 6,000 ft nearly straight above the town. While eating brunch, my conspicuous getup sparked another conversation with a fellow traveler. The guy looked like just your run-of-the mill baby-boomer tourist, but apparently the guy had done extensive distance cycling in Europe in his younger years. I told him about my plans, and we had a nice chat about his cycling past. It&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;s interesting to see the type of connections you bridge with strangers when traveling alone and conspicuously (e.g. decked out in climbing gear, or cycling gear, etc.) &amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#147; experiences that would have been missed in any other circumstance.\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\nAfter I could eat no more, I continued on my way down the flat river plains of Yoho. Gradually, the mountains receded behind me, and the temperature began to rise. About an hour into the ride, I reached my first road construction zone, which turned out to be surprisingly pleasant. As traffic was stopped for alternate 1-way travel, I cycled past the long long line of cars and passengers lounging on the roadside until I reached the front of the line (hehe). The roadworker there was very chatty, pointing out various landmarks of the peaks and glaciers nearby. She was even nice enough to give me a few minutes head start through the construction zone before unleashing the rest of the traffic!\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\nAs I left the Rockies behind, my thermometer continued to climb. I kept it shaded, but still I recorded a (very brief) high of 104&lt;sup&gt;o&lt;/sup&gt; F that day (perhaps due to the road radiating heat?), and I felt more than a little feint and nauseas at time. Luckily I had plenty of water! Also, today there were still high headwinds that made the net downhill ride harder than expected, but at least it gave me occasional reprieve from the heat.\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;table&gt;\r\n&lt;tbody&gt;\r\n&lt;tr&gt;\r\n&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-X5R05zQBUjk/ULXEH7OjHtI/AAAAAAABhEQ/nVjk3Zz-C-4/s2000/2008-08-08%2520-%252010%2520-%2520Roadside%2520views%2520.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-X5R05zQBUjk/ULXEH7OjHtI/AAAAAAABhEQ/nVjk3Zz-C-4/s400/2008-08-08%2520-%252010%2520-%2520Roadside%2520views%2520.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\r\n&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-v4JdTfGIBaU/ULXEGAROWxI/AAAAAAABhEI/HfRTIUoHwZA/s2000/2008-08-08%2520-%252009%2520-%2520Roadside%2520views%2520.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-v4JdTfGIBaU/ULXEGAROWxI/AAAAAAABhEI/HfRTIUoHwZA/s400/2008-08-08%2520-%252009%2520-%2520Roadside%2520views%2520.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\r\n&lt;/tr&gt;\r\n&lt;/tbody&gt;\r\n&lt;/table&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Leaving the Rockies behind&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;\r\n\r\nAs I neared Golden the road enters a deep, rugged canyon. Here there was an impressive viaduct &lt;a href=\"http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1422/679375696_94a914b5f9_o.jpg\"&gt;(1*)&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;a href=\"http://www.joconl.com/images/archivesid/24262/100.jpg\"&gt;(2)&lt;/a&gt; that I crossed, which this time was a nice surprise, with spacious shoulders and a feeling of soaring over the canyon. The downside was the headwall to climb out of the canyon and into Golden. It was a very steep grade for several hundred feet and it nearly finished me off for the day. I stopped for a rest, ate some food, and lugged myself the remaining miles into Golden.\r\n\r\n*&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Photo by Nautical9 at flickr.com&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\nHaving no idea where I could sleep that night, I pulled into the visitor center on the near side of town, where I was directed to a trailer park that was nearby (and not uphill!).  I also checked the latest weather forecast. It didn&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;t look good &amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#147; a 50% chance of slight rain tomorrow. I wanted to avoid rain, especially when crossing Roger&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;s Pass and the avalanche tunnels en route. However, the forecast for Glacier called for only a 50% of scattered showers, with 1-2mm of precipitation &amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#147; not too bad. Plus, throughout my time in the Canadian Rockies, nearly every day that rain was forecast turned out to be sunny (and vice-versa), so I had begun to take the forecasts more casually. I decided I would just see how the weather looked tomorrow, and if it wasn&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;t too bad, to attempt my 90-mile ride to Revelstoke while keeping a close eye on the weather.\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\nAfter deciding what to do the next day, I checked in at the R.V. camp, set up my bivvy next to some interesting Swiss motorcyclists, and rejoiced as I did my first load of laundry for the trip (imagine lasting 11 incredibly sweaty days with only 2 shirts and 2 shorts!).\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\nWith a mind towards packing in more calories to prepare for the much longer day tomorrow (and the first real crux, surmounting Roger&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;s Pass), I walked over to a neighboring hotel just as rain started to fall. There I ate steak and drank good tap beer at the hotel bar. While eating, I met two Hollanders (different ones) who were traveling across Western Canada in an R.V. They had remembered me from the road earlier that day, and the Hollanders joked that if they saw me the next day as they drove over Roger&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;s Pass, they would tempt me with an offer for a ride over the pass to Revelstoke.\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\nAfter a filling dinner, I retired to my freshly rain-soaked bivvy and enjoyed a good book before turning in for the night.\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;h2&gt;\r\n&lt;a name=\"TOC-Day-12-Bad-Decisions-Bad-Weather---Golden-to-Revelstoke\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Day 12 &amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#147; Bad Decisions &amp;amp; Bad Weather - &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Golden to Revelstoke&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;\r\n&lt;/h2&gt;\r\n&lt;a name=\"Day12\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\r\n&lt;hr&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-LhT6MUgxuFI/ULXGC8PO4yI/AAAAAAABhRI/lcuubMryWoY/s2000/05%2520-%2520Route%2520Map%2520-%2520Golden-Revelstoke%2520-%2520Route%2520Map.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-LhT6MUgxuFI/ULXGC8PO4yI/AAAAAAABhRI/lcuubMryWoY/s800/05%2520-%2520Route%2520Map%2520-%2520Golden-Revelstoke%2520-%2520Route%2520Map.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;table&gt;\r\n&lt;tbody&gt;\r\n&lt;tr&gt;\r\n&lt;td&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-IzHHv7dyNcA/ULXF6YrQ-yI/AAAAAAABhQA/AqkHv8KfSPU/s2000/05%2520-%2520Golden%2520to%2520Revelstoke%2520Route%2520Profile.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-IzHHv7dyNcA/ULXF6YrQ-yI/AAAAAAABhQA/AqkHv8KfSPU/s800/05%2520-%2520Golden%2520to%2520Revelstoke%2520Route%2520Profile.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;/td&gt;\r\n&lt;/tr&gt;\r\n&lt;/tbody&gt;\r\n&lt;/table&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;u&gt;By Bike:&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/b&gt;\r\n&lt;ul&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;Distance: 65.7 miles\r\n&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;Elevation Gain: 4,050 ft\r\n&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;/ul&gt;\r\n\r\nToday I awoke to uncertain weather. Looking to the north the sky was clear. To the south was somewhat mixed, but not too threatening. Meanwhile a valley fog was still rolling in bands across the landscape, but was sure to dissipate soon. Well, the weather wasn&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;t wonderful, but it wasn&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;t terrible either. I took my time eating an ample breakfast at the motel, and the fog had already started to burn off by the time I hit the road.\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;table align=\"left\" cellpadding=\"5%\"&gt;\r\n&lt;tbody&gt;\r\n&lt;tr&gt;\r\n&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-9bmCLyoicSE/ULXEKiLuGiI/AAAAAAABhEo/DLnJeLxjJb8/s2000/2008-08-09%2520-%252001%2520-%2520Morning%2520Fog%2520in%2520Golden.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-9bmCLyoicSE/ULXEKiLuGiI/AAAAAAABhEo/DLnJeLxjJb8/s300/2008-08-09%2520-%252001%2520-%2520Morning%2520Fog%2520in%2520Golden.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\r\n&lt;/tr&gt;\r\n&lt;tr&gt;\r\n&lt;td&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;&lt;b&gt;Foggy morning in Golden&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;/td&gt;\r\n&lt;/tr&gt;\r\n&lt;/tbody&gt;\r\n&lt;/table&gt;\r\n\r\nI had been experiencing a lingering and growing fatigue since the start of my trip. I hadn&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;t experienced any DOMS (delayed onset muscle fatigue), nor or other soreness on most days, and the fatigue didn&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;t feel like I was tiring myself out during the day. It was more of an underlying fatigue, occasionally leaving me spacey and lessening morale, but it usually got better whenever I got a chance to gorge myself. I realized that I had absolutely no idea how many calories I should be eating each day, and for the most part had been subsisting off of GU, Cliff Bars, and Peanut butter sandwiches, bagels, and the occasional dinner in town while spending hours a day on a heavily loaded bicycle or hiking for miles and climbing thousands of feet. Also, I wasn&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;t eating while on my bicycle.\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\nI would have to make an effort to consume more calories. Today I strategized two ways to help do this. First, I would pack along Snickers candy bars, since they are much more appetizing and fattening than Cliff Bars. They could also be a good morale booster. Also, both for morale and regular eating, I decided I would experiment with riding the first 30-40 miles of my expected 90-mile ride without break (as usual), but beyond this I would stop every 10 miles to eat a GU or Cliff Bar (ca. every hour), take a good long sip of water from my camelback. Standing and stretching a bit while doing this could help the saddle soreness, back soreness, and hand numbness that inevitably worked up during the long riding days.\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\nThe ride out from Golden was nice and easy, with a short downhill, and then lots of flat terrain with only the occasional small hill. I made excellent time, cruising at a nice fast speed as passed through bands of thick fog and sunny clearings. The first major climbs of the day (and my largest continuous climbs of the trip) passed by fine &amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#147; all I had to do was remember to slow down and focus on perceived effort and not on speed or how far I had to go. The fog was finally gone and the weather was mostly clear and sunny, even over the Columbia Range to the West.\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-pyQCHAUzqtI/ULXELW-u-BI/AAAAAAABhEw/zNOoCHLdwNs/s2000/2008-08-09%2520-%252003%2520-%2520My%2520bike%2520in%2520the%2520rain.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-pyQCHAUzqtI/ULXELW-u-BI/AAAAAAABhEw/zNOoCHLdwNs/s800/2008-08-09%2520-%252003%2520-%2520My%2520bike%2520in%2520the%2520rain.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Waiting out the rain&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;\r\n \r\n\r\nI crested the first summit of the day and dropped down the backside into a canyon as I turned south towards Roger&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;s Pass.  Just as I passed the entrance to Glacier National Park, storm clouds suddenly began to pour over the crest of the Columbia Range. Rain appeared to be imminent, so when I found a good roadside pullout, I pulled off, wrapped rain covers on my panniers, threw on my rain poncho, and took a beating from the first wave of rain as I stood out in the open, as no meaningful shelter was available. Still, I stayed mostly dry, as did my bike seat and gear. The rain appeared to be a small thunderstorm cell, so I waited for it to pass, and after about 20 minutes the rain had stopped. Another 20 minutes and it was sunny again and the road was dry.\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\nI had reservations about trying to cycle over Roger&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;s Pass now. However, as things stood, I was 40 miles into my ride. Returning to Golden would mean that would have cycled 80 miles that day and would still be a day behind. Plus, I was almost halfway done with the ride, with the crest of Roger&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;s Pass only 10 miles away. After that, it would all be downhill from there and a very fast downhill at that.  Plus, base d on the weather forecast, I had received all of the rain I was likely to encounter that day, or at least any more rain should be fairly light. So I decided to go for it. \r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\nSo I began the long climb to Roger&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;s Pass, which would be my first real test-piece of the cycle tour for how I would handle the dreaded &amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#156;death pass&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#157; in the Coastal Range at the end of my trip. From the East, Roger&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;s Pass climbs about 2,000 feet continuously over about 8 miles. It got very steep very fast and the grade never let up, but I was insistent on never dropping into my third chain-ring, since I had to reserve that for the &amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#156;death pass&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#157; &amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#147; if I used if here, I would have much less confidence later.\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\nAbout halfway up the pass, the shoulder narrowed and got rough, forcing me to occasionally wander partway over into the road, so I was very attentive with my rear view mirror. The steepness was really getting to me, so after passing a blind turn with a narrow shoulder (yikes!), I pulled across the road to a turnout for a brief break, feeling very glad all the while that I had bothered to mount such a bright and tall safety flag on my bicycle. The grade of the road was so steep that after my brake, I couldn&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;t start straight up the road from a standing stop, forcing me to coast downhill and pull a U-turn. \r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\nA bothersome problem was starting to occur that also forced me to resume riding like this. Beginning the day before as I climbed the final headwall into Golden, I noticed that if I stopped on a hill and then attempted to start riding directly up the hill again, my pedals and crankshaft would disengage from chain ring and spin freely until I put my feet down to avoid tipping over. As this started to occur, I could only avoid it on lesser slopes, or if I reduced the starting tension by running the bike uphill first, or coasting downhill first. Then the crankshaft would catch again and I could resume pedaling. If I was lucky, I could get the same effect by briefly slowing my pedaling down, and staring up again slowly before I tipped over. It was a minor but very disturbing irritation that seemed to be getting worse, and was much more noticeable on uphills, making it very troublesome on Roger&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;s Pass.\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;table align=\"left\" cellpadding=\"5%\"&gt;\r\n&lt;tbody&gt;\r\n&lt;tr&gt;\r\n&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-a2smcdyeFJY/ULXENXkesoI/AAAAAAABhFA/qgB3-o1yiXs/s2000/2008-08-09%2520-%252007%2520-%2520Avalanche%2520tunnel.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-a2smcdyeFJY/ULXENXkesoI/AAAAAAABhFA/qgB3-o1yiXs/s300/2008-08-09%2520-%252007%2520-%2520Avalanche%2520tunnel.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\r\n&lt;/tr&gt;\r\n&lt;tr&gt;\r\n&lt;td&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Avalanche Shed&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;/td&gt;\r\n&lt;/tr&gt;\r\n&lt;/tbody&gt;\r\n&lt;/table&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\nAbout halfway up the pass, it started raining again, but there was no good place to stop to take cover. It was a light rain, though, and I only had another 5 miles to go until the crest. As soon as I found a slightly wider part of the shoulder, I stopped to put my trusty gallon zip-lock bags over my shoes. With my toes shoved firmly into the toe clips, they stayed on and worked surprisingly well for keeping my feet dry &amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#147; at first.  Every now and then I would stop, either from fatigue, or losing my momentum from a swerve around an obstacle on the pavement (the shoulders in B.C. were littered with trash, holes and cracks, as compared to Alberta&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;s) or losing my concentration from the one or two cars that honked their horns at me despite me being well off the road at the time and visible plenty far ahead (to me it was obvious that the cars were timing their honks to harass me as this only happened on the straight-aways). Each time it was harder and harder to start again as my pedals disengaged and spun freely, and each time I stopped I managed to lose the zip-locks from one foot or the other, necessitating another stop and using another bag.\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\nFinally I was nearly at the pass and began to feel relieved. Until I reached my first avalanche shed, that it. Because Roger&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;s Pass is so narrow, with steep mountains rising thousands of feet on both sides of the road, the road is extremely vulnerable to avalanches. Also, unlike the canyons in Utah&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;s Wasatch Range, no avalanche control work is done out here due to the large distances and small population. Instead, at each avalanche path, a shed is built over the road, creating a tunnel for the road and a bed for the avalanche to slide on, clear of the road.\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\nThe sheds were hundreds of feet long, and on the uphill this took some time to pass through, leaving me unnerved for a while, and pressured to cycle harder than I wanted to in order to speed through them. These sheds had several unanticipated problems for me on a bicycle, too. First, they weren&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;t lit. Although I had lots of reflective tape, a reflective flag, and 2 tail lights, I still didn&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;t like it. Second, the shoulder got very narrow. And 3rd, the shoulders had small rumble-strips carved into them, making for a bumpy and slow ride. So each tunnel provided a few minutes of hurried cycling and elevated stress before I could slow down and relax. But I only had a handful to pass through before the summit, and I expected no problem breezing through them at 20-25 mph on the downhill.\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\nAt last I reached the pass, where there was a large parking lot and gas station. I ate a full lunch, chugged a Gatorade and wolfed down 2 Snickers Bars, buying more of both for the rest of the ride. By now the rain had stopped, with the clouds clearing again, letting the sun shine brightly down. From here on it was all downhill from here &amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#147; I thought the hard part of the ride was over.\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;table&gt;\r\n&lt;tbody&gt;\r\n&lt;tr&gt;\r\n&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-gpv3FptlYEI/ULXEMdapw6I/AAAAAAABhE4/1wiQLB1JRNo/s2000/2008-08-09%2520-%252006%2520-%2520Mt%2520Sir%2520Donald%2520at%2520Rogers%2520Pass.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-gpv3FptlYEI/ULXEMdapw6I/AAAAAAABhE4/1wiQLB1JRNo/s400/2008-08-09%2520-%252006%2520-%2520Mt%2520Sir%2520Donald%2520at%2520Rogers%2520Pass.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\r\n&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-j3jYS9obNOU/ULXEOeGeiLI/AAAAAAABhFI/akZElvLMHKU/s2000/2008-08-09%2520-%252008%2520-%2520Unsettled%2520Weather%2520at%2520Rogers%2520Pass.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-j3jYS9obNOU/ULXEOeGeiLI/AAAAAAABhFI/akZElvLMHKU/s400/2008-08-09%2520-%252008%2520-%2520Unsettled%2520Weather%2520at%2520Rogers%2520Pass.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\r\n&lt;/tr&gt;\r\n&lt;/tbody&gt;\r\n&lt;/table&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Roger\'s Pass&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\nAs I pulled away from the gas station, I admired the emerging views of the glaciated peaks of the Columbia Rage. But downhill from me I saw a wall of low clouds.  &amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#156;No biggie&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#157; I thought &amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#147; these are small clouds since they aren&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;t reaching very high, so I should be able to blast right through them.  And that is when I began to lose control.\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;table align=\"right\" cellpadding=\"5%\" width=\"210\"&gt;\r\n&lt;tbody&gt;\r\n&lt;tr&gt;\r\n&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-w2_Nwt-4xcs/ULXEPP5HJWI/AAAAAAABhFQ/yfQqRZlBhQk/s2000/2008-08-09%2520-%252009%2520-%2520Glacier%2520Ntl%2520Park.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-w2_Nwt-4xcs/ULXEPP5HJWI/AAAAAAABhFQ/yfQqRZlBhQk/s300/2008-08-09%2520-%252009%2520-%2520Glacier%2520Ntl%2520Park.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\r\n&lt;/tr&gt;\r\n&lt;tr&gt;\r\n&lt;td&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;\r\n&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;center&gt;Bad weather ahead, but it doesn\'t look that bad . . .&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;/td&gt;\r\n&lt;/tr&gt;\r\n&lt;/tbody&gt;\r\n&lt;/table&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\nAs I descended, I rounded a hard corner, and I ran head on into a monster storm that had been lurking out of site behind the turn in the canyon. The sky quickly darkened and I was hit head on by an incredibly strong wind. Despite the slopes at the pass being 5% or greater, I had to cycle as hard as I could to not drop below 10 mph. At some times I was going nearly as slow as 5 mph on the downhill while cranking as hard as I could! As I battled the winds, a downpour started. \r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\nI stopped to put on my zip-lock bags, and had trouble starting again as my pedals spun freely.  I got going, but lost a bag in the process. I realized this a while later and stopped to put on a fresh one. This happened multiple times. The wind blew the rain so hard that despite wearing waterproof shells, the rain was driven through every small opening or lapping of the shell layers, completely soaking me.\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\nAnd then I reached the avalanche tunnels. Now they were dark and slick. I discovered on my first tunnel that the shoulder rumble strips, covered with so much water, became very slick, and I began to skid. After nearly crashing into the raised walkway wall, I got off my bike and awkwardly walked on the wall, bending over to walk my bike along the tunnel edge. In the process I lost some more zip-lock bags. After the initial skid, I did this on every tunnel with a raised walkway, often losing zip-locks in the process of walking the bike or attempting to start it again. Eventually I ran out of zip-lock bags and my feet became soaked.\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\nNow I was soaked from head to toe in freezing rain. Winds were roaring incredibly hard, and I had descended over 5 miles away from and over 500 ft below the pass. Turning around wasn&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;t an option. I could have stopped, gotten out my bivvy, and waited out the rain, except the road had few shoulders and rose up or dropped off steeply on both sides. And if I had still been dry this could have seemed more appealing, but as I was already drenched, it seemed a bad idea to stop and let my body cool down in soggy clothes. Also, Revelstoke was all downhill from here, and this rain couldn&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;t last that much longer could it? I rationalized that my best bet now was to forge ahead and drop below the worst of the rain as fast as I could rather than digging in for shelter or turning back. This didn&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;t work out, but even now it isn&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;t clear to me which of the 3 options would have been the most dangerous at that point.\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\nFinally, about halfway down to Revelstoke from the pass, only 25 miles from safety, I walked my bike through an avalanche shed, only to find that I couldn&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;t get the pedals to engage again. I tried and tried, and nothing happened. Now I was stuck on a roadside shoulder between two avalanche tunnels with no shelter and nowhere to go. I began to get really angry, frustrated, and frightened at this point as the bike failed to start. As I began to despair, a van passed by, slowed down, and pulled over onto the shoulder.\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\nI ran over to the van with my bike as fast as I could.\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\n&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#156;Hi,&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#157; the driver with an Italian accent said, &amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#156;my name is Louie. Do you need a ride?&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#157;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\nThe timing couldn&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;t have been better. I threw my bike into the back of the van and jumped into the warm, dry shelter of the front passenger seat as Louie started down the road again. He was heading to Revelstoke too, for work with an outdoor guiding group. He said he had done a fair share of cycle touring in Tuscany, and having experienced some nasty rainstorms there, and empathizing with my situation, took pity on me when he saw me in my sad state alongside the road.\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\nAs I decompressed from the adrenaline rush and frigid wet cold, I watched the canyon go by. It was disappointing and also strange to suddenly be riding in a vehicle, passing effortlessly and quickly through terrain I had expected to work my way through on two wheels. But still, Louie was a LIFE SAVER.\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\nDown in Revelstoke, the town was wet from rain, but only mildly so. The clouds were clearing again, and it appeared the town had been going through this cycle all day, but in a much milder form than what I had experienced up higher. Louie was so great that he took me straight to where I planned to stay for the night, the SameSun Hostel. My day was over &amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#147; no more distance to travel, and now I was safe, drying, and warming.\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\nI hauled my bike and gear up into the hostel, every inch of me and my panniers dripping with water. \r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\n&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#156;Hello,&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#157; the girl at the front desk dryly declared, &amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#156;how was your day?&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#157;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\n&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#156;Wet and cold,&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#157; I replied in a weak tone, half jokingly, half dejectedly.\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\n&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#156;Well,&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#157; she said, dismissively, sitting at her warm, dry, comfy desk, pop music playing in the background, &amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#156;it&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;s been raining all day here too. We&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;ve all been wet and cold today.&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#157;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;WTF?!! Urge to kill, rising . . .&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\nOn the bright side, yes, there was room available, the hostel had safe bike storage, and it was fine for me to take over the backyard to dry out gear in the sunshine. \r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\nAfter getting settled, I spent the rest of the afternoon drying out every piece of gear I had, stringing up lines across the backyard and laying items out on the sun baked pavement. I finished drying the valuable items I was worried about getting stolen, and then I took off to find some food. \r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\nOn the drive into town, Louie told me about a good Chinese restaurant in town.  It just so happened that they had all-you-can eat buffets, but only one day a week. It also just so happened that that day was today. \r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-1MGvXPt6pUc/ULXESX5BTiI/AAAAAAABhFw/6IIeUe3Flzc/s2000/2008-08-11%2520-%252002%2520-%2520Mountains%2520Above%2520Revelstoke.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-1MGvXPt6pUc/ULXESX5BTiI/AAAAAAABhFw/6IIeUe3Flzc/s800/2008-08-11%2520-%252002%2520-%2520Mountains%2520Above%2520Revelstoke.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Mt Begbie above Revelstoke&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Time to abuse this all-you-can eat policy!!!!&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\nI wandered over to the restaurant, still slightly wet, splattered with mud, and ravenous. The restaurant owners didn\'t know what hit them. I think I ate 3 or 4 meals worth. At least I was there eating for over 2 hours, and went through 4 or 5 heaping plates. I ate until I couldn&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;t eat any more.  Still, even though I was stuffed, I felt a strong urge to keep munching on food. I think my body was finally beginning to feel the calorie deficit in ways beyond fatigue, because this experience of gorging until I was stuffed, and still feeling a strong urge to keep eating persisted for the next several days that I was stuck in Revelstoke with no hard physical labor to distract me.\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\nAs I headed back for the night, another torrential downpour washed through town. I escaped most of it, but it soaked the clothes I had drying back to the state they were in when I first got into town. Doh!\r\n\r\n\r\n&lt;h2&gt;\r\n&lt;a name=\"TOC-Day-13-14-Stuck-in-Revelstoke---Rest-Days\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Day 13-14 &amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#147; Stuck in Revelstoke - Rest Days&lt;/h2&gt;\r\n&lt;a name=\"Day13\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\r\n&lt;hr&gt;\r\n&lt;h3&gt;\r\n&lt;a name=\"TOC-August-10th---Haaappy-birrrrthday-too-meeee-.-.-.\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;August 10th - Haaappy birrrrthday, too meeee .  .  .&lt;/h3&gt;\r\n\r\nNot quite the way I expected to spend my birthday. Yes, I expected to celebrate it alone, but under better circumstances. As things stand, I narrowly averted death in a torrential downpour at Roger&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;s Pass, escaping humbled and with my ass whooped.  Now I had a bike that was broken, and I seemed to be marooned in town as the weather forecast had changed to a week of solid rain.\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;table align=\"right\"&gt;\r\n&lt;tbody&gt;\r\n&lt;tr&gt;\r\n&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-Zzk4pTB_wL8/ULXET7Hz26I/AAAAAAABhGA/9s6IP5KPeS0/s2000/2008-08-12%2520-%252001%2520-%2520Postcard%2520-%2520Revelstoke.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-Zzk4pTB_wL8/ULXET7Hz26I/AAAAAAABhGA/9s6IP5KPeS0/s300/2008-08-12%2520-%252001%2520-%2520Postcard%2520-%2520Revelstoke.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\r\n&lt;/tr&gt;\r\n&lt;tr&gt;\r\n&lt;td&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Revelstoke in postcard form&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;/td&gt;\r\n&lt;/tr&gt;\r\n&lt;/tbody&gt;\r\n&lt;/table&gt;\r\n\r\nI wandered around town and had breakfast at a very nice Main Street caf&amp;Atilde;&amp;copy;. They had very interesting styles of Mochas and Lattes that I haven&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;t seen anywhere else. Breakfast was very tasting with ample portions too. The day was sunnier than forecasted, but still cloudy of the Monashee Mountains to the West. After my experience yesterday, I was now more terrified of the rain than ever. I absolutely would NOT attempt to bicycle over the Monashee Mountains as long as it looked like there was any chance of rain. \r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\nStill, I held out hope that things would be better tomorrow, and perhaps my bike would magically work again. If so, I would press on. If not, then I might cry uncle and take a Greyhound, either a ways West to escape the weather, or just give up all together and take it to Vancouver and hang out there for a week. I was beaten down, demoralized, famished, and exhausted, and looking at my cycling map, it appeared that I was only about 1/3 of the way there, and I hadn&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;t even passed the hardest parts yet: The interior desert and the &amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#156;death pass.&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#157; I was very close to giving up.\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\nTo lighten the mood, I spent the day wandering around town with my camera. Revelstoke is a very picturesque mountain town (albeit at a low 1,500 ft above sea level) perched on a small riverside deposit in a narrow mountain canyon. \r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\nA lot of the architecture felt old-town, and there was a beautiful truss bridge and suspension bridge crossing the river. I unleashed the inner nerd/engineer and made sure to get good photographs of the structural connections of the bridges for learning/reference &amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#147; they were of a very different style and age from each other, and the small scale made access to good views of these connections very easy.\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;table&gt;\r\n&lt;tbody&gt;\r\n&lt;tr&gt;\r\n&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-160cnfmfDsc/ULXEP4T3U_I/AAAAAAABhFY/8Mdf9kM629s/s2000/2008-08-10%2520-%252001%2520-%2520Revelstoke.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-160cnfmfDsc/ULXEP4T3U_I/AAAAAAABhFY/8Mdf9kM629s/s400/2008-08-10%2520-%252001%2520-%2520Revelstoke.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\r\n&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-GSUA1dq3UTc/ULXERFvNkUI/AAAAAAABhFg/LnUmh-Nom6g/s2000/2008-08-10%2520-%252002%2520-%2520Revelstoke%2520Bridges.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-GSUA1dq3UTc/ULXERFvNkUI/AAAAAAABhFg/LnUmh-Nom6g/s400/2008-08-10%2520-%252002%2520-%2520Revelstoke%2520Bridges.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\r\n&lt;/tr&gt;\r\n&lt;/tbody&gt;\r\n&lt;/table&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Bridges and river in Revelstoke&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\nLooping back through town I found a bike shop that was open. The repair shop was closed for the week, but there was another repair shop that opened tomorrow. I would take my bike there. Here, though, I made sure to buy some special waterproof cycling covers for my shoes. Such an item does exist, and I&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;d say vital for any touring where there is a possibility of rain.\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\nTo top off the day, I went back to the Chinese restaurant for more food, although sadly there as no buffet that day. Still, my birthday came up in my conversation with the employees (I had no ulterior motive, really!), and they gave me a discount and complimentary drink. \r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\nThroughout the day there was patchy, light rain in town, and as evening wore on, the weather gradually cleared. Despite the uncertain weather forecast, I still held out hope for an opening in the weather. I went back to the hostel and enjoyed my first night&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;s sleep in a bed since I had started my trip.\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;h3&gt;\r\n&lt;a name=\"TOC-August-11th---Bike-Repair\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;August 11th - Bike Repair&lt;/h3&gt;\r\n\r\nI was at the bike shop first thing the following morning. I was even there before they opened. I wheeled my bike in and hung around  as they put it on the stand to find out in depth what really was wrong with the bike, and to really MAKE SURE this time that there weren&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;t any other surprises lurking.\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\nThe diagnosis was that the bike cassette and free wheel were shot. These parts are what allow the rear wheel of a bicycle to spin freely without turning the pedals, but allow the pedals to engage the wheel and turn it when you pedal. Apparently, mine were completely worn out, and if I had managed to continue riding a few more miles, my rear wheel would have locked up solid.\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\nToday was my lucky day, though, as they had the right parts to fix my bike, so they went about stripping the parts out from my rear hub and replacing them. There was no way I could have ever fixed this problem on the road &amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#147; I wasn&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;t just lacking the technical know-how for this, but also much of the equipment needed would not be brought on a cycling tour. \r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\nFinally my bike was repaired, passed inspection, and was ready for more abuse. On the down side, the weather was worse today, but the forecast claimed tomorrow would be better.  With nothing better to do, I spent the rest of the day in a caf&amp;Atilde;&amp;copy;, reading and playing with a neat 3D wooden block puzzle my friend Nala had gotten for me at a crafts fair in London. The blocks form a cube in their basic form, but included was a sheet of other forms to build. This kept me busy all day, although I quickly discovered a logic to solving the forms rationally and methodically rather than by guessing, and I ended up solving all of the puzzles. With time to kill, I then re-solved them, illustrating a nice answer key to go with the game.\r\n&lt;div&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;/div&gt;\r\n&lt;div&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;/div&gt;\r\n&lt;div&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"http://www.engrailhistory.info/r112.html\" style=\"text-align:-webkit-center\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"http://www.engrailhistory.info/imfile/x00020.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br style=\"text-align:-webkit-center\"&gt;\r\n&lt;b style=\"text-align:-webkit-center\"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Add photo of block, with answer key?&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&amp;Acirc;&amp;nbsp;\r\n\r\n&lt;hr&gt;\r\n&lt;hr&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"http://www.markpthomas.com/mountaineering/trip-reports/canada/cycling-and-scrambling-from-calgary-to-vancouver\"&gt;Part 0 - Cycling and Scrambling from Calgary to Vancouver&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"http://www.markpthomas.com/mountaineering/trip-reports/canada/cycling-and-scrambling-from-calgary-to-vancouver/part-i---calgary-through-the-canadian-rockies\"&gt;Part I - Calgary through the Canadian Rockies&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"http://www.markpthomas.com/mountaineering/trip-reports/canada/cycling-and-scrambling-from-calgary-to-vancouver/part-ii---lake-louise-lake-o-hara-areas\"&gt;Part II - Lake Louise &amp;amp; Lake O\'Hara Areas&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n-&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"http://www.markpthomas.com/mountaineering/trip-reports/canada/cycling-and-scrambling-from-calgary-to-vancouver/part-iv---british-columbia-s-desert\"&gt;Part IV - British Columbia\'s Desert?!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"http://www.markpthomas.com/mountaineering/trip-reports/canada/cycling-and-scrambling-from-calgary-to-vancouver/part-v---crossing-the-coastal-range-to-vancouver\"&gt;Part V - Crossing the Coastal Range to Vancouver&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"http://www.markpthomas.com/mountaineering/trip-reports/canada/cycling-and-scrambling-from-calgary-to-vancouver/epilogue\"&gt;Epilogue&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;hr&gt;\r\n&lt;hr&gt;\r\n&lt;h2&gt;\r\n&lt;a name=\"TOC-Links\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Links&lt;/h2&gt;\r\n&lt;ul&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"https://picasaweb.google.com/105894936663116565516/20080807to11CanadaCyclingTripMishapsInTheMiddleRanges?authuser=0&amp;amp;feat=directlink\"&gt;Picasa Album - 2008-08-07to11 - Canada Cycling Trip - Mishaps in the Middle Ranges&lt;/a&gt;\r\n&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"http://www.summitpost.org/cycling-and-scrambling-from-calgary-to-vancouver/531269\"&gt;SummitPost TR&lt;/a&gt;\r\n&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;/ul&gt;\r\n&lt;/div&gt;\r\n&lt;/div&gt; \r\n'),(18,149,'/mountaineering/trip-reports/canada/cycling-and-scrambling-from-calgary-to-vancouver/part-iv---british-columbia-s-desert','Part IV - British Columbia\'s Desert?!','Part IV - British Columbia\'s Desert?!','Trip_Report','content: &lt;div dir=\"ltr\"&gt;\r\n&lt;h1&gt;\r\n&lt;a name=\"TOC-Part-IV---British-Columbia-s-Desert-\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Part IV - British Columbia\'s Desert?!

I still wasn&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;t sure if I would continue on today. I was all set, and all I needed was to convince myself that the weather was stable enough to try to sneak over the Monashee range and out to freedom. According to the weather forecasts, it was hot and dry with no precipitation expected further West, while Revelstoke was stuck in an endless cycle of rainstorms. \r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\nDuring breakfast some of the other customers told me the saw two cute 20-something-year old girls touring on the same route I was, following behind. They had camped in Glacier yesterday and would pass through town today. We joked that perhaps if I was lucky they would catch up to me, or me to them? &lt;i&gt;Wink,wink.&lt;/i&gt; (Sadly I never saw these mythological amazons). While waiting for the morning fog to burn off, and still on the fence about riding, I spent time teaching the daughters/servers of the caf&amp;Atilde;&amp;copy; owner how to fold a cool flower out of their napkins &amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#147; a nice presentation piece for them to use? At least we all were entertained by it.\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\nFinally, I convinced myself that the weather looked good enough to attempt to cross the Monashee range, and at 9:20 am I resumed my ride westward. Today I would follow the same eating and resting strategy of my previous riding day, as it seemed to reduce my fatigue, especially later in the day. I had no solid goal for how far I would go today. At least to Salmon Arm. There was a hostel just short of Chase that was my main goal. And maybe, just maybe, I would push on all the way to Kamloops since the terrain in between was so flat.\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/--boICmZT8Yo/ULXDyMRdW-I/AAAAAAABhBk/DQj11N0lyeo/s2000/2008-08-12%2520-%252004%2520-%2520Chateau%2520in%2520Monashee%2520Mtns.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/--boICmZT8Yo/ULXDyMRdW-I/AAAAAAABhBk/DQj11N0lyeo/s640/2008-08-12%2520-%252004%2520-%2520Chateau%2520in%2520Monashee%2520Mtns.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Haunted Chateau&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\nCrossing the Monashee Range was a very strange experience. It was as if I was in Disneyland, except the Canadian version where it inhabited an enchanted forest rather than a concrete amusement park in the middle of a city. About every other mile I passed a tourist trap. There was an advertised enchanted forest. There was a tree-top sky walk &amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#147; several in fact. There was a mini-Europe hidden in the trees, with windmills, cottages, and other miniaturized elements of European towns. I half expected to be attacked by Lilliputians along the way. At Eagle Pass, the flat mellow summit of the range, there are some lakes that converge at a place called &lt;a href=\"http://www.travel-wise.com/north-america/canada/western/ghost-towns.aspx\"&gt;Three Valley Gap&lt;/a&gt;, where along the lakeside was a self-advertised haunted Chateau. The scariest part of the Chateau was the architecture: a gaudy red paint job and an awkwardly large form and proportions. Needless to say, I rushed through this place as fast as I could.\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\nI rode the first 46 miles straight, arriving at Sicamous at 12:10, perfect time to stop for a good lunch. Sicamous was at another sort of threshold for my trip. I was officially leaving behind the continuous mountain country that I had been cycling in since I left the plains of Alberta. From here, I would be in hill country transitioning to desert. Along the way I would be riding along the gigantic Shuswap Lake, which is really a multi-pronged reservoir that stretches for miles.\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;table&gt;\r\n&lt;tbody&gt;\r\n&lt;tr&gt;\r\n&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-u9f9WiNjruA/ULXDyyRBciI/AAAAAAABhBs/4wDaXtE0Pks/s2000/2008-08-12%2520-%252006%2520-%2520Salmon%2520Lakes.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-u9f9WiNjruA/ULXDyyRBciI/AAAAAAABhBs/4wDaXtE0Pks/s400/2008-08-12%2520-%252006%2520-%2520Salmon%2520Lakes.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\r\n&lt;td&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-3hwow3PCPc8/ULXDz9ydeSI/AAAAAAABhB0/_dnCKO15gKk/s2000/2008-08-12%2520-%252007%2520-%2520Chase.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-3hwow3PCPc8/ULXDz9ydeSI/AAAAAAABhB0/_dnCKO15gKk/s400/2008-08-12%2520-%252007%2520-%2520Chase.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\r\n&lt;/td&gt;\r\n&lt;/tr&gt;\r\n&lt;tr&gt;\r\n&lt;td&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Salmon Lakes&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;/td&gt;\r\n&lt;td&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Chase&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;/td&gt;\r\n&lt;/tr&gt;\r\n&lt;/tbody&gt;\r\n&lt;/table&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\nI crossed the bridge over the first spur, ascending a mild hill. Sometimes the shoulder was torn up and narrow, but it was never all that bad compared to the earlier roads. With the 10-mile stops providing a great boost, before I know it I was going up the long slow include into Salmon Arm, and it was beginning to get blistering hot again. Another gas station break to chug Gatorade and eat Snickers, and then on I went, blasting downhill and around the tip of the next spur of the reservoir. I climbed another rise and entered a broad, semi-arid valley, popping out on the other side high above the reservoir&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;s main artery that eventually fed into an earth dam at Chase and then became the Thompson River.\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-HOL1W9pCX38/ULXD0m0zq9I/AAAAAAABhB8/Vklir4pf4rU/s2000/2008-08-12%2520-%252008%2520-%2520River%2520past%2520Chase.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-HOL1W9pCX38/ULXD0m0zq9I/AAAAAAABhB8/Vklir4pf4rU/s800/2008-08-12%2520-%252008%2520-%2520River%2520past%2520Chase.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Thompson River&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;\r\n\r\nI made it to the hostel in Sorrento by mid-afternoon, but I felt so good that I just kept on going. I flew downhill as I dropped into the river valley at Chase, and the terrain became noticeable more arid. As I pressed on, a transcontinental train passed beside me next to the highway. It was full of recreational riders, many of whom were staring at me, and some were waving, so I waved back &amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#147; I was feeling GOOD again.\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\nOne way that I wasn&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;t feeling good, though, was with numbness in my hands. I have always had a problem with this on any bike ride lasting longer than an hour, and despite my best effort to avoid leaning too hard into my handlebars, and my best attempts to constantly change hand positions, wear gloves, use padded handlebars, and rest on the meatier parts of the sides of my hands, my hands would still ultimately get some numbness in them on every ride on this trip over 30 miles long. Today the numbness got worse and worse, and despite efforts to get feeling back into them each time I stopped, inevitably they would go numb in the last 2 or 3 fingers before my next rest stop.\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\nAt this point the numbness was getting worrisome, and slightly painful. Also, the sun was getting low in the sky and I was far enough along the Thompson River to be committed to making it to Kamloops. I raced the sun, picking up the effort to get the day done and over with. It wasn&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;t until the last 10 miles that it got very hard psychologically to continue on, but by taking mental baby steps I made the last stretch into town just past sunset, pulling into a motel at 8:45 pm. \r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-yBQfZsMTbyM/ULXD2FlLmyI/AAAAAAABhCE/MmoNMdl67u8/s2000/2008-08-12%2520-%252009%2520-%2520Coming%2520into%2520Kamloops.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-yBQfZsMTbyM/ULXD2FlLmyI/AAAAAAABhCE/MmoNMdl67u8/s800/2008-08-12%2520-%252009%2520-%2520Coming%2520into%2520Kamloops.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Nearing Kamloops&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\nThe day&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;s total was 137 miles, as compared to my record before the trip of 50 miles and my current record on the trip of 97 miles on my first day &amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#147; a gigantic leap in cycling distance. I had spent 11 hours today on my bicycle and my hands were incredibly numb, and the feeling was very bothersome as I had difficulty grasping things and my dexterity was compromised. I would have to work very hard tomorrow to not make this any worse than it already was, and I would battle this extreme numbness for the rest of my ride.\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\nAfter checking in, I took my first warm, indoor shower of the trip, purchased ample junk food for a calorie and morale booster, and beer for that and helping soothe my soreness. Before I got too much into my celebratory feast, though, I fell asleep.\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;h2&gt;\r\n&lt;a name=\"TOC-Day-16-Sweating-it-Out---Kamloops-to-Marble-Canyon\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Day 16 &amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#147; Sweating it Out - &lt;i&gt;Kamloops to Marble Canyon&lt;/i&gt;\r\n&lt;/h2&gt;\r\n&lt;a name=\"Day16\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\r\n&lt;hr&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-0RzmbFKY6Aw/ULXFyC2QQcI/AAAAAAABhPA/PY9aWfBoJnE/s2000/07%2520-%2520Kamloops-Marble%2520Canyon%2520-%2520Route%2520Map.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-0RzmbFKY6Aw/ULXFyC2QQcI/AAAAAAABhPA/PY9aWfBoJnE/s800/07%2520-%2520Kamloops-Marble%2520Canyon%2520-%2520Route%2520Map.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-2auBNWQX-Bg/ULXF5w_VkNI/AAAAAAABhP4/tUxvxVJaPZc/s2000/07%2520-%2520Kamloops%2520to%2520Marble%2520Canyon%2520Route%2520Profile.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-2auBNWQX-Bg/ULXF5w_VkNI/AAAAAAABhP4/tUxvxVJaPZc/s800/07%2520-%2520Kamloops%2520to%2520Marble%2520Canyon%2520Route%2520Profile.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;u&gt;By Bike:&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/b&gt;\r\n&lt;ul&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;Distance: 77.9 miles\r\n&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;Elevation Gain: 5,430 ft\r\n&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;/ul&gt;\r\n\r\nI woke up just in time to catch the tail end of the motel&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;s free continental breakfast. It was pretty well picked over by the time I got there, so I wasn&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;t able to gorge myself as planned, but it gave me an excuse to lighten my load by eating more of my own food. Not that this helped much because once again I only drank one beer out of the bottle 6-pack that I bought, and so once again I packed this valuable weight in my panniers, certain that it was worth the effort. Since I got to sleep so late the night before, I had slept in and was starting much later than planned and later than was ideal.  I had a long ways to go, as I aimed to cycle about 90 miles to Lillooete, where I would be ideally positioned to attack the &amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#156;death pass&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#157; fresh the next day.\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;table&gt;\r\n&lt;tbody&gt;\r\n&lt;tr&gt;\r\n&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-rBHtfnbHc8g/ULXD2mZM8mI/AAAAAAABhCM/tbLzmkWr_5A/s2000/2008-08-13%2520-%252003%2520-%2520Me%2520on%2520Bike.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-rBHtfnbHc8g/ULXD2mZM8mI/AAAAAAABhCM/tbLzmkWr_5A/s400/2008-08-13%2520-%252003%2520-%2520Me%2520on%2520Bike.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\r\n&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-Al6h3ouY31s/ULXD3aknngI/AAAAAAABhCU/mFwDmARqrLQ/s2000/2008-08-13%2520-%252005%2520-%2520Me%2520on%2520Bike.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-Al6h3ouY31s/ULXD3aknngI/AAAAAAABhCU/mFwDmARqrLQ/s400/2008-08-13%2520-%252005%2520-%2520Me%2520on%2520Bike.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\r\n&lt;/tr&gt;\r\n&lt;/tbody&gt;\r\n&lt;/table&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Riding Around Kamloops&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\nAs I cycled out from the motel parking lot it was 9 am and already the thermometers outside were reading 95&lt;sup&gt;o&lt;/sup&gt; F! Uggggggh . . . Today there were a couple of hills I was dreading as they were as steep as 10%, but some of the hardest parts were unexpected, which was probably for the best.  The first surprise crux was getting out of town. I had skimmed over this section during my preliminary planning, and I hadn&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;t fully appreciated that the climb out of town gained over 1,000 ft continuously, nor that it did so in about 8 miles. The first part, in town, was the steepest and it was unrelenting. The heat made it worse. I turned up my angry heavy death metal and sweated it out.\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\nAs I left town, the dry grasses of the previous day were gone, and in their place was sagebrush and &amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#147; brown pine trees!  Andre, my Swiss friend, wasn&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;t kidding! Speckled around the hills above Kamloops were many brown pine trees. They didn&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;t quite look like dead trees, and their sickly brown and gold colors, only a slight shade different from the brown and orange soil, made the landscape feel even more hot and arid.\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-H2TmcAzzL2g/ULXD4n4rZQI/AAAAAAABhCc/qZ77WRn-DlI/s2000/2008-08-13%2520-%252006%2520-%2520Leaving%2520Kamloops.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-H2TmcAzzL2g/ULXD4n4rZQI/AAAAAAABhCc/qZ77WRn-DlI/s800/2008-08-13%2520-%252006%2520-%2520Leaving%2520Kamloops.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;One of the city \'parks\' in Kamloops&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\nAtop the first climb I left the main highway, which continued on to Vancouver via the standard cross-country cycling route. The road I was on would continue to be Canada Highway 1 until I reached Cache Creek, but from here on out the traffic would be much better. Much less of it, and no more cross-country semi-trucks! Instead, most of the rest of the trip would be on true country roads. \r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\nAs soon as I crested the summit I quickly lost all the elevation I had gained as the road dropped back down to Kamloops Lake.  About as soon as I reached the shore of the lake, the road then climbed up again, steeply at about 5% to a road cut through a promontory above the lake. Another 500 ft of fun, and my thermometer was reading in the high 90s.  At the top, I was rewarded with a nice viewpoint to stop at, with unexpectedly impressive views looking back along Kamloops Lake to Kamloops. Beyond the lookout the road dropped straight back down again about 600 ft to Savona, my only other town of the day to pass through other than Cache Creek.\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-4JXTqkqSE6k/ULXD5rTXgsI/AAAAAAABhCk/T9WQqsdKMWk/s2000/2008-08-13%2520-%252007%2520-%2520Kamloops%2520River.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-4JXTqkqSE6k/ULXD5rTXgsI/AAAAAAABhCk/T9WQqsdKMWk/s800/2008-08-13%2520-%252007%2520-%2520Kamloops%2520River.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Looking back toward Kamloops from atop the promontory&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\nAs I left Savona I hit the first 8% grade hill. It was only 200 ft tall, but with my thermometer reaching 102&lt;sup&gt;o&lt;/sup&gt; F it was not the best place to practice steep hill climbing. The horizon rolled away above me, shimmering in the extreme heat. At a snail&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;s pace I worked my way up the hill, cresting the top and then . . . I immediately went straight back down the backside, losing all of the gained elevation. I had traveled 30 miles and gained 2,000 ft, yet I was still at the same elevation as what I had started at!\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\nThe next trough came quickly, too quickly as I was spending most of my time climbing and very little time on flats or coasting downhill. And then the hill climbed 400 ft at an 8% grade. Now my muscles were really aching from the heat and exertion, and I was feeling nauseas and burning through my 6 liters of water surprisingly fast. Finally I had reprieve as the next 5 miles was downhill as I returned to my benchmark elevation of 1,200 ft above sea level. The entire time my thermometer was hovering between 99&lt;sup&gt;o&lt;/sup&gt; F and 102&lt;sup&gt;o&lt;/sup&gt; F.\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;table&gt;\r\n&lt;tbody&gt;\r\n&lt;tr&gt;\r\n&lt;td&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-OohSoYVwg8s/ULXD6l30BwI/AAAAAAABhCs/J-Dhxqbq_Ws/s2000/2008-08-13%2520-%252013%2520-%2520Desert%2520Country.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-OohSoYVwg8s/ULXD6l30BwI/AAAAAAABhCs/J-Dhxqbq_Ws/s400/2008-08-13%2520-%252013%2520-%2520Desert%2520Country.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Desert Country, Canada Style&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;/td&gt;\r\n&lt;td&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-062hpqteXz4/ULXD75ixCfI/AAAAAAABhC0/M8M37ttboFU/s2000/2008-08-13%2520-%252014%2520-%2520Desert%2520Country.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-062hpqteXz4/ULXD75ixCfI/AAAAAAABhC0/M8M37ttboFU/s400/2008-08-13%2520-%252014%2520-%2520Desert%2520Country.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;There are some mountains somewhere here . . .&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;/td&gt;\r\n&lt;/tr&gt;\r\n&lt;/tbody&gt;\r\n&lt;/table&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-9oXvZvjDgkw/ULXD9GTiwiI/AAAAAAABhC8/quUB05cc2gg/s2000/2008-08-13%2520-%252015%2520-%2520Desert%2520Country.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-9oXvZvjDgkw/ULXD9GTiwiI/AAAAAAABhC8/quUB05cc2gg/s800/2008-08-13%2520-%252015%2520-%2520Desert%2520Country.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Lush British Columbia&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\nEven with the warnings about this country, I was still shocked by it. The place looked and felt more like southern Utah than wet, mountainous British Columbia! The only signs of life here was the occasional irrigated farm alongside the broad Thompson River. According to the information signs, apparently the river was once a highway for boat traffic into the interior during Western Canada&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;s gold rush.\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\nI climbed another steep 400 ft headwall and was feeling beat. I really didn&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;t feel that I had it in me to make it to Lillooete. I scaled back plans and decided to just make it to Cache Creek and find camping there. It was just too hot, and the steep ups and downs were just too demoralizing and taxing on my legs. I coasted into town and pulled into a Dairy Queen for luscious ice cream. \r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\nAs I enjoyed my relief from the sun and pain of cycling, a road-tripper at the Dairy Queen struck up a conversation with me. He enjoyed mountain biking and he was fascinated with my trip ambitions. He had never considered someone cycling these types of distances, and as I told him more about my trip, he then inquired as to my methods.\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\nRoad-tripper: &amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#156;So what is your secret? What sustains you on such long rides?&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#157;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\nMe (feeling a tad awkward and confused about this question): &amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#156;Well, I usually have Gus about 1 an hour to keep hunger down and replace lost glucose. Snickers are very helpful too, as is Gatorade for replacing lost salt from sweating.&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#157;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\nRoad-tripper: &amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#156;No no, not that. I mean, how do you keep going and not tire out?&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#157;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\nMe: &amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#156;I try to get into a good meditative rhythm, focus on the now and a sustainable pace and &amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#147; &amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#156;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\nRoad-tripper: &amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#156;No no, not that either. How do you keep your energy up? What is your secret?&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#157;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\nMe (Out of ideas of what he could be asking, feeling a little annoyed):  &amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#156;My I-Pod, rockin&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153; away to Nine Inch Nails, Tool, and Crystal Method.&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#157;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"https://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/vPpekpA6y51-pjg8oaiE99MTjNZETYmyPJy0liipFm0?feat=directlink\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-ueas1QiU6YI/ULXD-J8f6lI/AAAAAAABhDE/5MLpUGTssHU/s800/2008-08-13%2520-%252016%2520-%2520Biking%2520to%2520Marble%2520Canyon.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Entering the Pavilion Mountains&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;\r\n\r\nThis still didn&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;t satisfy the road-tripper with whatever he was asking for (perhaps he wanted to know what sort of drug/supplement I was using? None) so he finally gave up and left me alone.\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-HbRcLuqrKd4/ULXEAAkPulI/AAAAAAABhDU/i6JDEE1paM4/s2000/2008-08-13%2520-%252021%2520-%2520Marble%2520Canyon%2520Sunset.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-HbRcLuqrKd4/ULXEAAkPulI/AAAAAAABhDU/i6JDEE1paM4/s800/2008-08-13%2520-%252021%2520-%2520Marble%2520Canyon%2520Sunset.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Sunset at Marble Canyon Lake&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;\r\n\r\nJust as I was thinking of leaving the DQ to begin scouting for a campground or (as a last resort) a motel, a couple that was also road-tripping struck up a conversation. When I asked them about places to stay, they suggested a place called Marble Lake. Apparently it was along my route, except it was a &amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#152;little&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153; ways out of town up in the hills where it was much cooler and more lush than the hot desert around Cache Creek. They said it wasn&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;t too far away and well worth pressing on to stop there. Of course, they made this judgment for cycling based on their driving the distance. It sounded nice to me, and although I needed to stop, promise of easy escape from the desert seemed too good to pass up, although if I actually knew how far away the campground was, I may have wimped out and stayed in Cache Creek.\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-gHSXIJ-Rpvc/ULXEAgRoVkI/AAAAAAABhDc/OV_MMNWFth0/s2000/2008-08-13%2520-%252022%2520-%2520Marble%2520Canyon%2520Sunset.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-gHSXIJ-Rpvc/ULXEAgRoVkI/AAAAAAABhDc/OV_MMNWFth0/s800/2008-08-13%2520-%252022%2520-%2520Marble%2520Canyon%2520Sunset.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Sunset at Marble Canyon Lake&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;\r\n\r\nIt was late-afternoon when I finally left Cache Creek, slightly rested and at least ready to go a bit further to reach this good campsite. Little did I know that I had another 30 miles to cycle and 1,400 ft to gain in order to reach this sanctuary in the Pavilion Mountains. I turned off the main highway and headed up into the hills. The air cooled quickly and soon the landscape became more lush again as I entered a new microclimate. This was nice. Apart from the occasional up and down that had me groaning, the riding was very nice. However, I kept expecting to find the campsite around the next bend, and the sun was once again getting low in the sky, with no campsite to be found.\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\nFinally I crested the pass, and once again I pulled into my night&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;s camping spot just around sunset. The campsite was situated next to a beautiful lake in a small mountain canyon lined with some enticing-looking crags &amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#147; apparently good for &lt;a href=\"http://www.summitpost.org/area/range/363228/marble-canyon-british-columbia.html\"&gt;rock climbing&lt;/a&gt;. As Marble Canyon was in a Provincial Park, there was a ranger there, Connie, who showed me to a good campsite and struck up a nice conversation. She lived the small town of Pavilion, just outside the Park, and was working here with her husband, Kim, also a ranger, who joined in on the conversation. Connie was very familiar with the &amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#156;death pass&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#157; that I was so concerned about. Apparently the locals refer to it as &amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#156;The Duffy&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#157;, named after the lake at its crest. She said that, yes, the first part is murderously steep, but eventually it eased up into a nicer road. Shoulders were decent, and the road was popular with cyclists, so cars would know to look out for me. Also, it was fairly well-shaded by pine trees. \r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\nConnie insisted that in the canyon I could easily access the river to refill water along the way, which was good news for me. I had planned to carry a full 6 liters of water on this segment since it was so long, but now I decided to reduce it to 3 liters and just refill from the river as I rode along. After hearing this good news, I once again drank the rest of my beers to lighten my load, ate up more of my food, and went to bed well fed and relaxed.\r\n\r\n&lt;hr&gt;\r\n&lt;hr&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"http://www.markpthomas.com/mountaineering/trip-reports/canada/cycling-and-scrambling-from-calgary-to-vancouver\"&gt;Part 0 - Cycling and Scrambling from Calgary to Vancouver&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"http://www.markpthomas.com/mountaineering/trip-reports/canada/cycling-and-scrambling-from-calgary-to-vancouver/part-i---calgary-through-the-canadian-rockies\"&gt;Part I - Calgary through the Canadian Rockies&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"http://www.markpthomas.com/mountaineering/trip-reports/canada/cycling-and-scrambling-from-calgary-to-vancouver/part-ii---lake-louise-lake-o-hara-areas\"&gt;Part II - Lake Louise &amp;amp; Lake O\'Hara Areas&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"http://www.markpthomas.com/mountaineering/trip-reports/canada/cycling-and-scrambling-from-calgary-to-vancouver/part-iii---mishaps-in-the-middle-ranges\"&gt;Part III - Mishaps in the Middle Ranges&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n-&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"http://www.markpthomas.com/mountaineering/trip-reports/canada/cycling-and-scrambling-from-calgary-to-vancouver/part-v---crossing-the-coastal-range-to-vancouver\"&gt;Part V - Crossing the Coastal Range to Vancouver&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"http://www.markpthomas.com/mountaineering/trip-reports/canada/cycling-and-scrambling-from-calgary-to-vancouver/epilogue\"&gt;Epilogue&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;hr&gt;\r\n&lt;hr&gt;\r\n&lt;h2&gt;\r\n&lt;a name=\"TOC-Links\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Links&lt;/h2&gt;\r\n&lt;ul&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"https://picasaweb.google.com/105894936663116565516/20080812to13CanadaCyclingTripBritishColumbiaSDesert?authuser=0&amp;amp;feat=directlink\"&gt;Picasa Album - 2008-08-12to13 - Canada Cycling Trip - British Columbia\'s Desert&lt;/a&gt;\r\n&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"http://www.summitpost.org/cycling-and-scrambling-from-calgary-to-vancouver/531269\"&gt;SummitPost TR&lt;/a&gt;\r\n&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;/ul&gt;\r\n&lt;/div&gt; \r\n'),(19,15,'/mountaineering/trip-reports/california/lost-arrow-spire-tip','Lost Arrow Spire (Tip)','Working Out My Fear of Heights on Lost Arrow Spire Tip','Trip_Report','content: &lt;div dir=\"ltr\"&gt;\r\n&lt;h1&gt;\r\n&lt;a name=\"TOC-Working-Out-My-Fear-of-Heights-on-Lost-Arrow-Spire-Tip\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Working Out My Fear of Heights on Lost Arrow Spire Tip&lt;/h1&gt;\r\n&lt;h2&gt;\r\n&lt;a name=\"TOC-September-18-2011\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;September 18, 2011&lt;/h2&gt;\r\n&lt;hr&gt;\r\n&lt;hr&gt;\r\n&lt;h2&gt;\r\n&lt;a name=\"TOC-My-History-with-Heights\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;My History with Heights&lt;/h2&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;\r\n&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;\r\nI have a confession to make. I used to be deathly afraid of heights. \r\n&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;\r\nI still am, sort of, but I&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;ve learned to work with it.\r\n&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;\r\nMy father believes it stems from my premature attempt at toddler free-soloing during a trip to Lake Powell, which left me perched on a ledge well below the top of the sandstone escarpment but above a 50-100 ft clean drop into deep water. The exposure was bad enough that he was scared down climbing to me and he had nightmares for a while after the rescue. No one had any idea how I had gotten in such a precarious position, and if it hadn&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;t been for luck and a passing motorboat seeing me &amp;amp; reporting me to my parents, who knows what would have happened?\r\n&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;\r\nAs a child I would freak out and cry when we would be driving on a road alongside a steep drop (like the ones along roadsides in Great Basin National Park), though airplanes didn&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;t scare me unless we were taking off or landing. Technically it wasn&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;t heights that scared me &amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#147; it was &amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#152;exposure&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;. Airplanes were manageable, but nothing was more terrifying to me than the idea of being out on a big open face with a view straight down the fall line. No one would have expected me to get into mountaineering, rock climbing, or, especially, big wall climbing.\r\n&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;\r\nDuring a winter descent into a canyon in the San Rafael Swell as a Boy Scout, we had to rappel to get past cliffs and snow covered slabs. It was there that I first realized that when I was connected into a safety system, although I was still frightened, I could take that fear and &amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#152;set it aside&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;, so to speak, and focus on the task at hand. This allowed me to get into rock climbing, though I still have moments atop some climbs when I&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;m unroped in exposed terrain where I act, as my late friend Brent Haick put it, &amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#156;Like a cat stuck in a tree.&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#157;\r\n&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;\r\n&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;table&gt;\r\n&lt;tbody&gt;\r\n&lt;tr&gt;\r\n&lt;td&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-iys7wOD5sac/TpvTx6pQddI/AAAAAAAA20o/e_TDdxU-Xhk/s2000/1998-10%2520-%25200001c%2520-%2520Exposure.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img height=\"300\" src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-iys7wOD5sac/TpvTx6pQddI/AAAAAAAA20o/e_TDdxU-Xhk/s640/1998-10%2520-%25200001c%2520-%2520Exposure.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;/td&gt;\r\n&lt;/tr&gt;\r\n&lt;tr&gt;\r\n&lt;td&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;&lt;b&gt;October, 1998 - I didn\'t summit Mt Nebo this time, but I returned a year later and succeeded in hiking to the top.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;/td&gt;\r\n&lt;/tr&gt;\r\n&lt;/tbody&gt;\r\n&lt;/table&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;\r\nIn high school I started climbing outdoors and the summer of 2002 just before I left for college I followed my first multi-pitch trad climb on Outside Corner (5.7, 3P) on JHCOB Wall&lt;a name=\"Back1\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=\"#F1\"&gt;[1]&lt;/a&gt; with my climbing partner, Gary.

I could will myself into action, but even with a nice ledge to sit on and a 3-piece equalized anchor built on bomber pro, if I felt exposed I could never relax. There was always an underlying feeling of terror that left me uneasy even as I tried to logically put such worries aside and enjoy myself. The idea of a hanging belay TERRIFIED ME.  I made several weak attempts to get into lead climbing, but I never got beyond the point of leading 5.5 confidently and 5.6 only if I could see the pitch first. Oddly I was fine in corners and on ridges, but big open faces left me feeling very exposed.\r\n&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;\r\n&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;table&gt;\r\n&lt;tbody&gt;\r\n&lt;tr&gt;\r\n&lt;td&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-JiPbwe-Mc4g/Tm-44YCpIQI/AAAAAAAAySs/sXHha8LGtUw/s2000/2010-06-19%2520-%252014a%2520-%2520Mt%2520Sill%2520Annotate.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img height=\"300\" src=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-JiPbwe-Mc4g/Tm-44YCpIQI/AAAAAAAAySs/sXHha8LGtUw/s800/2010-06-19%2520-%252014a%2520-%2520Mt%2520Sill%2520Annotate.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;/td&gt;\r\n&lt;/tr&gt;\r\n&lt;tr&gt;\r\n&lt;td&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mt Sill.

In exposed terrain or hard climbing I would become hyperfocused on the moves I made and would lose any real appreciation for the exposure (although not the true hazards). I could even enjoy hanging from the anchor. In prior years I had turned down several climbing partners who had tried to talk me into attempting a big wall because, frankly, that sounded like one of the scariest things I could do. \r\n&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;\r\n&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;table&gt;\r\n&lt;tbody&gt;\r\n&lt;tr&gt;\r\n&lt;td&gt;\r\n&lt;table&gt;\r\n&lt;tbody&gt;\r\n&lt;tr&gt;\r\n&lt;td&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-zA5DFhIJrCU/Tm-OQIusWOI/AAAAAAAAutE/_XCpyC4y4V0/s2000/2011-06-20%252520-%25252034%252520-%252520Me%252520on%252520Hand%252520Jive%2525205_9.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img height=\"300\" src=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-zA5DFhIJrCU/Tm-OQIusWOI/AAAAAAAAutE/_XCpyC4y4V0/s720/2011-06-20%252520-%25252034%252520-%252520Me%252520on%252520Hand%252520Jive%2525205_9.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;/td&gt;\r\n&lt;/tr&gt;\r\n&lt;tr&gt;\r\n&lt;td&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;&lt;b&gt;Leading Hand Jive (5.9), in Little Cottonwood Canyon&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;/td&gt;\r\n&lt;/tr&gt;\r\n&lt;/tbody&gt;\r\n&lt;/table&gt;\r\n&lt;/td&gt;\r\n&lt;td&gt;\r\n&lt;table&gt;\r\n&lt;tbody&gt;\r\n&lt;tr&gt;\r\n&lt;td&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-yi1MMJIwIio/Tm-nAf1CDxI/AAAAAAAAweI/AYKt4NiQFyY/s2000/2011-07-31%2520-%252020%2520-%2520Looking%2520Down%2520from%2520P3%2520Crux%2520of%2520Traveler%2520Buttress.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img height=\"300\" src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-yi1MMJIwIio/Tm-nAf1CDxI/AAAAAAAAweI/AYKt4NiQFyY/s512/2011-07-31%252520-%25252020%252520-%252520Looking%252520Down%252520from%252520P3%252520Crux%252520of%252520Traveler%252520Buttress.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;/td&gt;\r\n&lt;/tr&gt;\r\n&lt;tr&gt;\r\n&lt;td&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;&lt;b&gt;Looking Down the Most Exposed Part of \r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\nTraveler Buttress (5.9, 4P)&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;/td&gt;\r\n&lt;/tr&gt;\r\n&lt;/tbody&gt;\r\n&lt;/table&gt;\r\n&lt;/td&gt;\r\n&lt;/tr&gt;\r\n&lt;/tbody&gt;\r\n&lt;/table&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;\r\nWhen Shane Rathbun started bugging me last year, I started getting interested. Theoretically I was interested. I still didn&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;t know if I could psychologically handle a big wall. LAS Tip, in my mind, represented the ultimate test in handling exposure, since not only was it VERY exposed, but that exposure comes on hard &amp;amp; fast as the climb is first approached by rappelling from the rim rather than gradually gaining height over pitches of climbing. I made it my goal to do the climb in Fall 2011, not only as a beginner aid climbing goal, but to truly see if I had what it took to be able to handle the exposure of and do some big wall routes.\r\n&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;hr&gt;\r\n&lt;hr&gt;\r\n&lt;h2&gt;\r\n&lt;a name=\"TOC-Prep-Climbs\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Prep Climbs&lt;/h2&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;\r\n&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;\r\nAs the trip came together, I planned to do the climb over the weekend of September 17-18 with my friend, Eddy Kim, who was also just starting out aid climbing. We had practiced some aid climbing together outside and at the gym, and had rehearsed the Tyrolean system &lt;a href=\"http://www.supertopo.com/tr/Urban-Aid-Climbing-How-to-Spend-a-Weekend-not-in-the-Mountains/t11169n.html\"&gt;numerous times&lt;/a&gt; in the weeks leading up to the climb to make sure we really understood what we were doing. \r\n&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;\r\n&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;table&gt;\r\n&lt;tbody&gt;\r\n&lt;tr&gt;\r\n&lt;td&gt;\r\n&lt;table&gt;\r\n&lt;tbody&gt;\r\n&lt;tr&gt;\r\n&lt;td&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-zhaNujAhCjI/TnKh7s_x53I/AAAAAAAAyyc/qhaqKykDsz8/s2000/2011-09-08%252520-%25252003%252520-%252520Eddy%252520on%252520the%252520first%252520Tyrolean%252520at%252520Indian%252520Rock.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img height=\"250\" src=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-zhaNujAhCjI/TnKh7s_x53I/AAAAAAAAyyc/qhaqKykDsz8/s640/2011-09-08%252520-%25252003%252520-%252520Eddy%252520on%252520the%252520first%252520Tyrolean%252520at%252520Indian%252520Rock.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;/td&gt;\r\n&lt;/tr&gt;\r\n&lt;tr&gt;\r\n&lt;td&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;&lt;b&gt;Eddy doing a Tyrolean at Indian Rock Park in Berkeley&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;/td&gt;\r\n&lt;/tr&gt;\r\n&lt;/tbody&gt;\r\n&lt;/table&gt;\r\n&lt;/td&gt;\r\n&lt;td&gt;\r\n&lt;table&gt;\r\n&lt;tbody&gt;\r\n&lt;tr&gt;\r\n&lt;td&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-nAKLFm-HpVY/TpvUYZUhBaI/AAAAAAAA3JQ/Tj6Eq8LgjTM/s2000/2011-09-14%252520-%25252003%252520-%252520Me%252520on%252520Slanted%252520Tyrolean.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img height=\"250\" src=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-nAKLFm-HpVY/TpvUYZUhBaI/AAAAAAAA3JQ/Tj6Eq8LgjTM/s640/2011-09-14%252520-%25252003%252520-%252520Me%252520on%252520Slanted%252520Tyrolean.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;/td&gt;\r\n&lt;/tr&gt;\r\n&lt;tr&gt;\r\n&lt;td&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;&lt;b&gt;More Playing on the Tyrolean&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;/td&gt;\r\n&lt;/tr&gt;\r\n&lt;/tbody&gt;\r\n&lt;/table&gt;\r\n&lt;/td&gt;\r\n&lt;/tr&gt;\r\n&lt;/tbody&gt;\r\n&lt;/table&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;\r\nEddy was fine leading bolt ladders, but since he was not as comfortable in leading on gear placements, I offered to lead both pitches of LAS Tip.

With a few directionals I  set up a TR on Gollum, Left, a great 5.10a OW with a memorable roof crux.\r\n&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;\r\n&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;table&gt;\r\n&lt;tbody&gt;\r\n&lt;tr&gt;\r\n&lt;td style=\"width:322px;height:341px\"&gt;\r\n&lt;table&gt;\r\n&lt;tbody&gt;\r\n&lt;tr&gt;\r\n&lt;td&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-WmofEP3Q9P8/TnlmEAKy2vI/AAAAAAAAza8/NBY9rcsyRLc/s2000/2011-09-17%252520-%25252009%252520-%252520Leading%252520Gollum%25252C%252520Right.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img height=\"300\" src=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-WmofEP3Q9P8/TnlmEAKy2vI/AAAAAAAAza8/NBY9rcsyRLc/s512/2011-09-17%252520-%25252009%252520-%252520Leading%252520Gollum%25252C%252520Right.jpg\" style=\"display:block;margin-right:auto;margin-left:auto;text-align:center;border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;/td&gt;\r\n&lt;/tr&gt;\r\n&lt;tr&gt;\r\n&lt;td&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;&lt;b&gt;Stemming Wide on Gollum, Right (5.8)&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;/td&gt;\r\n&lt;/tr&gt;\r\n&lt;/tbody&gt;\r\n&lt;/table&gt;\r\n&lt;/td&gt;\r\n&lt;td style=\"width:339px;height:341px\"&gt;\r\n&lt;table&gt;\r\n&lt;tbody&gt;\r\n&lt;tr&gt;\r\n&lt;td&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-2hAqo0CwGpQ/TnlmFlZWvTI/AAAAAAAAzbE/oOBwHo3zqo8/s2000/2011-09-17%252520-%25252013%252520-%252520%252520TRing%252520Gollum%25252C%252520Left%25252C%252520Lower.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img height=\"300\" src=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-2hAqo0CwGpQ/TnlmFlZWvTI/AAAAAAAAzbE/oOBwHo3zqo8/s512/2011-09-17%252520-%25252013%252520-%252520%252520TRing%252520Gollum%25252C%252520Left%25252C%252520Lower.jpg\" style=\"display:block;margin-right:auto;margin-left:auto;text-align:center;border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;/td&gt;\r\n&lt;/tr&gt;\r\n&lt;tr&gt;\r\n&lt;td&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;&lt;b&gt;Climbing the Easy Lower Section on Gollum, Left.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;/td&gt;\r\n&lt;/tr&gt;\r\n&lt;/tbody&gt;\r\n&lt;/table&gt;\r\n&lt;/td&gt;\r\n&lt;/tr&gt;\r\n&lt;tr&gt;\r\n&lt;td style=\"width:322px;height:358px\"&gt;\r\n&lt;table&gt;\r\n&lt;tbody&gt;\r\n&lt;tr&gt;\r\n&lt;td style=\"width:262px;height:316px\"&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-E8__9t47S4E/TnlmKu8uUUI/AAAAAAAAzbc/N8aMB9JvOFo/s2000/2011-09-17%252520-%25252019%252520-%252520%252520Gollum%25252C%252520Left%25252C%252520Climbing%252520the%252520Roof.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img height=\"300\" src=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-E8__9t47S4E/TnlmKu8uUUI/AAAAAAAAzbc/N8aMB9JvOFo/s512/2011-09-17%252520-%25252019%252520-%252520%252520Gollum%25252C%252520Left%25252C%252520Climbing%252520the%252520Roof.jpg\" style=\"display:block;margin-right:auto;margin-left:auto;text-align:center;border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;/td&gt;\r\n&lt;/tr&gt;\r\n&lt;tr&gt;\r\n&lt;td style=\"width:262px;height:33px\"&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;&lt;b&gt;Climbing the Roof OW on Gollum, Left (5.10a).&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;/td&gt;\r\n&lt;/tr&gt;\r\n&lt;/tbody&gt;\r\n&lt;/table&gt;\r\n&lt;/td&gt;\r\n&lt;td style=\"width:339px;height:358px\"&gt;\r\n&lt;table&gt;\r\n&lt;tbody&gt;\r\n&lt;tr&gt;\r\n&lt;td style=\"width:377px;height:316px\"&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-RopQK-C9LGA/TnlmLMrvj5I/AAAAAAAAzbg/55WNa3SJuL4/s2000/2011-09-17%252520-%25252020%252520-%252520%252520Gollum%25252C%252520Left%25252C%252520In%252520the%252520Squeeze.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img height=\"300\" src=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-RopQK-C9LGA/TnlmLMrvj5I/AAAAAAAAzbg/55WNa3SJuL4/s512/2011-09-17%252520-%25252020%252520-%252520%252520Gollum%25252C%252520Left%25252C%252520In%252520the%252520Squeeze.jpg\" style=\"display:block;margin-right:auto;margin-left:auto;text-align:center;border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;/td&gt;\r\n&lt;/tr&gt;\r\n&lt;tr&gt;\r\n&lt;td style=\"width:377px;height:33px\"&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;&lt;b&gt;Climbing the Squeeze Above the Crux OW on Gollum, Left.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;/td&gt;\r\n&lt;/tr&gt;\r\n&lt;/tbody&gt;\r\n&lt;/table&gt;\r\n&lt;/td&gt;\r\n&lt;/tr&gt;\r\n&lt;/tbody&gt;\r\n&lt;/table&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;\r\nFinally the French party finished and I tried my hand at leading the first pitch of Pacific Ocean Wall (C1).

Eddy and Owen reported that they saw another party camping near us heading towards the climb with ropes.\r\n&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;\r\n&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#156;Oh well,&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#157; I said. &amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#156;Let&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;s just take our time and head down later so that they are a ways ahead of us.&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#157;\r\n&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;\r\nI didn&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;t mind putting the climb off. Just thinking about it was beginning to leave me pretty uneasy, so I didn&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;t mind putting it off. Sadly once we made it to the Rim it was apparent that they were not climbing LAS that day as we were the only ones there. We could have started earlier as planned. Doh!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;\r\n&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;h2&gt;\r\n&lt;a name=\"TOC-Crux-of-the-Climb:-Choosing-the-Right-Tree-for-the-Rappel\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Crux of the Climb: Choosing the Right Tree for the Rappel&lt;/h2&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;\r\nBased on my memory of the features I&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;d seen from climbers doing the Tyrolean from previous trip reports, I chose the wrong tree to rappel from. It was the correct height according to the SuperTopo topo, but the trunk diameter seemed a little thin compared to the dimensions given. We didn&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;t see any rope marks on the trunk, but we didn&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;t know how marked up of a tree to expect. We could barely see the tip of LAS, so we decided it must be the correct tree and built our anchor.\r\n&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;\r\nNervously I started to rappel towards the edge. I began to roll back into total commitment over the edge and . . .\r\n&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;Bwaaaaa!  . . . \r\n&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;\r\n\r\n\r\n. . . . Doh! &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;\r\nJust as I was teetering on the brink I could see that we were too far north. I hauled myself back up the line and we searched for another tree. We soon found one that seemed properly aligned with the top of LAS. However, while this one had a larger trunk, it was also shorter. Hmmm . . . There were no other reasonable contenders around so we set up a new anchor on this tree.\r\n&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;\r\nNervously I started to rappel towards the edge.

Once I rapped far enough to be hanging over the edge I could see that I would still be hanging in space &lt;i&gt;beside&lt;/i&gt; the notch that we had intended to rappel into. I put my jumars on the rope and began my sorry retreat.\r\n&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;\r\nI began to wonder if subconsciously I was trying to back out of this climb . . .\r\n&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;\r\nWe looked around a bit more and wondered about the trees that were much more exposed and seemed too high compared to the height of the top of the LAS. I wandered over there and promptly found a tree with obvious rope marks on the bark.\r\n&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;\r\nI made 4 wraps on the tree with our 200&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153; static line for the anchor and began the rappel.\r\n&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;Bwaaaaa! . . .&lt;/b&gt;\r\n&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;\r\nHmm. This isn&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;t so bad once you&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;ve gotten started. \r\n&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;\r\nThe rappel is too long for one rope to reach, so two ropes are joined with a knot. This knot needs to be passed on rappel, which can be a major pain to do. Just by chance this knot was at a height just above a large flake on the wall, so both Eddy and I were each able to stand on the flake, let out rope tension, and pass the knot while standing on the rock before continuing our rappel. :-P\r\n&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;\r\nConsidering its position, the notch was surprisingly not exposed. By now we were in the warm sun and the winds had stopped. Finally at the notch, with calm air and warm sunshine, we were ready to start the climb.\r\n&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;\r\n&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;table&gt;\r\n&lt;tbody&gt;\r\n&lt;tr&gt;\r\n&lt;td&gt;\r\n&lt;table&gt;\r\n&lt;tbody&gt;\r\n&lt;tr&gt;\r\n&lt;td&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-FpwzLKPmLoE/Tnlmdvp41AI/AAAAAAAAzdA/1W6EbwDKhg4/s2000/2011-09-18%2520-%252006%2520-%2520Eddy%2520Passing%2520the%2520knot%2520on%2520Rappell.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img height=\"450\" src=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-FpwzLKPmLoE/Tnlmdvp41AI/AAAAAAAAzdA/1W6EbwDKhg4/s512/2011-09-18%2520-%252006%2520-%2520Eddy%2520Passing%2520the%2520knot%2520on%2520Rappell.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;/td&gt;\r\n&lt;/tr&gt;\r\n&lt;tr&gt;\r\n&lt;td&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;&lt;b&gt;Rappelling Into the Notch&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;/td&gt;\r\n&lt;/tr&gt;\r\n&lt;/tbody&gt;\r\n&lt;/table&gt;\r\n&lt;/td&gt;\r\n&lt;td&gt;\r\n&lt;table&gt;\r\n&lt;tbody&gt;\r\n&lt;tr&gt;\r\n&lt;td&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-IcSyOnY6g2E/Tnlma0FLOqI/AAAAAAAAzc4/YAj-oBY09fg/s2000/2011-09-18%2520-%252007%2520-%2520Lost%2520Arrow%2520Spire%2520from%2520the%2520Notch.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img height=\"450\" src=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-IcSyOnY6g2E/Tnlma0FLOqI/AAAAAAAAzc4/YAj-oBY09fg/s512/2011-09-18%2520-%252007%2520-%2520Lost%2520Arrow%2520Spire%2520from%2520the%2520Notch.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;/td&gt;\r\n&lt;/tr&gt;\r\n&lt;tr&gt;\r\n&lt;td&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;&lt;b&gt;Lost Arrow Spire from the Notch&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;/td&gt;\r\n&lt;/tr&gt;\r\n&lt;/tbody&gt;\r\n&lt;/table&gt;\r\n&lt;/td&gt;\r\n&lt;/tr&gt;\r\n&lt;/tbody&gt;\r\n&lt;/table&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;\r\n&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;\r\n&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;h2&gt;\r\n&lt;a name=\"TOC-Pitch-1-5.7-C1-\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Pitch 1 (5.7, C1)&lt;/h2&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;\r\n&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;\r\nI had heard that the first pitch starts out with sudden exposure as you reach around a corner. This was exactly the case.

So much for expectations. The offwidth section started out overhanging and traversing to the right in such a way that it was very awkward to climb the aiders and place gear around the corner. I placed a #3 4CU to get started, hurled a #4 4CU around the corner, and backcleaned the #3 after I finished wrestling my way onto my next piece. My sole #5 4CU went next, but the crack kept going and by this time I was too gassed to feel like spending time free climbing the offwidth. Apparently I hurled the #4 too quickly as it had become fixed, so for the next while I battled with getting it out before I could move on.\r\n&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;\r\n&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;table&gt;\r\n&lt;tbody&gt;\r\n&lt;tr&gt;\r\n&lt;td&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-XJcDjQzeObI/TnlmgevzlCI/AAAAAAAAzdM/fA8pWsVZzxE/s2000/2011-09-18%2520-%252011%2520-%25205_9%2520OW%2520before%2520Salathe%2520Ledge.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img height=\"500\" src=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-XJcDjQzeObI/TnlmgevzlCI/AAAAAAAAzdM/fA8pWsVZzxE/s512/2011-09-18%2520-%252011%2520-%25205_9%2520OW%2520before%2520Salathe%2520Ledge.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;/td&gt;\r\n&lt;/tr&gt;\r\n&lt;tr&gt;\r\n&lt;td&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;&lt;b&gt;Offwidth on Pitch 1&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;/td&gt;\r\n&lt;/tr&gt;\r\n&lt;/tbody&gt;\r\n&lt;/table&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;\r\nFrom there the offwidth was straightforward by probably barely less awkward as an aid climb than as a free climb. I was pretty beat up and my gloveless hands pretty battered after the fight was finally over (note to self &amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#147; wear fingerless gloves). At Salathe Ledge I fixed the line and ran it between a rock horn and through a directional off the right bolt to hold the rope clear of the wide crack. This made it much easier for Eddy to follow and clean.\r\n&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;\r\nDoing aid pitches without hauling is a strange thing. As the lead climber, since you are not hauling, so once you fix the line there is nothing to do but wait until your partner finishes cleaning the pitch. I was eating some lunch and spacing out when my cell phone rang.\r\n&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;\r\n&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#156;This is Mark,&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#157; I answered. &amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#156;Is this Sean?&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#157;\r\n&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;\r\n&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#156;Yeah.

You traverse directly out over the most exposed part of the ar&amp;Atilde;&amp;ordf;te and climb through the crux on mostly fixed gear and some big reaches (I ended up back cleaning almost all of my pro and relied on the fixed gear as backup).

The ladder wasn&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;t easy, though, as the bolts were very far apart and I had to step pretty high in my aiders, often tensioning off the lower bolt to reach the next bolt. Say what you might about aid climbing, but it is pretty burly and brutish on the biceps, abdominals, and abductors! A few bolts were missing hangers so I got to try out my wire rivet hangers. These don&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;t really stay on the bolts once you climb past (even when cinched tight), so I guess they are more like hooks, which you tend to bring along with you. They&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;re small enough that it worked out well to just leave them on my daisy &amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#152;biners for their occasional use on the pitch.\r\n&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;\r\n&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;table&gt;\r\n&lt;tbody&gt;\r\n&lt;tr&gt;\r\n&lt;td&gt;\r\n&lt;table&gt;\r\n&lt;tbody&gt;\r\n&lt;tr&gt;\r\n&lt;td&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-fTj8fSoD_o4/TnlmjkE2e6I/AAAAAAAAzdc/eX0hy8WlUGE/s2000/2011-09-18%2520-%252014%2520-%2520Mantel%2520%2526%2520fixed%2520pins%2520on%2520P2.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img height=\"450\" src=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-fTj8fSoD_o4/TnlmjkE2e6I/AAAAAAAAzdc/eX0hy8WlUGE/s720/2011-09-18%2520-%252014%2520-%2520Mantel%2520%2526%2520fixed%2520pins%2520on%2520P2.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;/td&gt;\r\n&lt;/tr&gt;\r\n&lt;tr&gt;\r\n&lt;td&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;&lt;b&gt;P2 Piton Ladder&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;/td&gt;\r\n&lt;/tr&gt;\r\n&lt;/tbody&gt;\r\n&lt;/table&gt;\r\n&lt;/td&gt;\r\n&lt;td&gt;\r\n&lt;table&gt;\r\n&lt;tbody&gt;\r\n&lt;tr&gt;\r\n&lt;td&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-A9C5I6i4yKU/TnlmkUuZ6eI/AAAAAAAAzdg/mBadLlBAwdA/s2000/2011-09-18%2520-%252015%2520-%2520Looking%2520down%252C%2520sort%2520of.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img height=\"450\" src=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-A9C5I6i4yKU/TnlmkUuZ6eI/AAAAAAAAzdg/mBadLlBAwdA/s720/2011-09-18%2520-%252015%2520-%2520Looking%2520down%252C%2520sort%2520of.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;/td&gt;\r\n&lt;/tr&gt;\r\n&lt;tr&gt;\r\n&lt;td&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;&lt;b&gt;Looking Down the 1200\' Drop&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;/td&gt;\r\n&lt;/tr&gt;\r\n&lt;/tbody&gt;\r\n&lt;/table&gt;\r\n&lt;/td&gt;\r\n&lt;/tr&gt;\r\n&lt;/tbody&gt;\r\n&lt;/table&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;\r\nThe bolt ladder ended at a mantel into an easy corner with a few pitons. Some mixed easy free &amp;amp; aid climbing quickly brought me to the top to the final aid ladder. To save draws I back cleaned every other bolt. After plugging a cam beneath the final roof and entering the final corner, I saw that one bolt was cut off flush with the granite and there were no signs of any potential gear placements. Since it was late in the day and I was in a hurry, I broke out my homemade cheater stick, which worked like a charm, and I barely lost any time bypassing the sheared bolt.\r\n&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;\r\n&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;table&gt;\r\n&lt;tbody&gt;\r\n&lt;tr&gt;\r\n&lt;td&gt;\r\n&lt;table&gt;\r\n&lt;tbody&gt;\r\n&lt;tr&gt;\r\n&lt;td&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-zU23F6gWOro/TnlmlKY7bjI/AAAAAAAAzdk/7uVvlsriUcY/s2000/2011-09-18%2520-%252016%2520-%2520Reachy%2520Bolt%2520Ladder.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img height=\"380\" src=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-zU23F6gWOro/TnlmlKY7bjI/AAAAAAAAzdk/7uVvlsriUcY/s720/2011-09-18%2520-%252016%2520-%2520Reachy%2520Bolt%2520Ladder.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;/td&gt;\r\n&lt;/tr&gt;\r\n&lt;tr&gt;\r\n&lt;td&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;&lt;b&gt;Final Bolt Ladder&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;/td&gt;\r\n&lt;/tr&gt;\r\n&lt;/tbody&gt;\r\n&lt;/table&gt;\r\n&lt;/td&gt;\r\n&lt;td&gt;\r\n&lt;table&gt;\r\n&lt;tbody&gt;\r\n&lt;tr&gt;\r\n&lt;td&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-5Smb-F7y4TE/TowIAJpRawI/AAAAAAAA2-w/cfRt7NSwO8o/s2000/2011-09-18%2520-%252017b%2520-%2520Nearing%2520the%2520end%2520of%2520P2-PaulKeller.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img height=\"380\" src=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-5Smb-F7y4TE/TowIAJpRawI/AAAAAAAA2-w/cfRt7NSwO8o/s800/2011-09-18%2520-%252017b%2520-%2520Nearing%2520the%2520end%2520of%2520P2-PaulKeller.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;/td&gt;\r\n&lt;/tr&gt;\r\n&lt;tr&gt;\r\n&lt;td&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;&lt;b&gt;Using the Cheater Stick in the Final Corner&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;/td&gt;\r\n&lt;/tr&gt;\r\n&lt;/tbody&gt;\r\n&lt;/table&gt;\r\n&lt;/td&gt;\r\n&lt;/tr&gt;\r\n&lt;/tbody&gt;\r\n&lt;/table&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;\r\nThe exit from the bolt ladder required some ingenuity for transitioning from aid to free here. You immediately go from standing on a bolt ladder to 5.5 friction climbing the rest of the way to the summit. I felt like I was too likely to fall on the friction slab when reaching back to unclip my last ladder/aider, so I clipped the rope to the bolt with a double-length runner with a knot tied in the middle. I then stood in the upper loop of this runner so that I could unclip my daisy. From there I could step onto the friction and step out of the runner, leaving it to Eddy to clean.  \r\n&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;\r\n&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;table&gt;\r\n&lt;tbody&gt;\r\n&lt;tr&gt;\r\n&lt;td&gt;\r\n&lt;table&gt;\r\n&lt;tbody&gt;\r\n&lt;tr&gt;\r\n&lt;td&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-VXc1wzdxNVg/Tnlml_3iaEI/AAAAAAAAzdo/oCYXtiR9-bo/s2000/2011-09-18%2520-%252017%2520-%2520Interesting%2520Piton%2520Placement.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img height=\"500\" src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-VXc1wzdxNVg/Tnlml_3iaEI/AAAAAAAAzdo/oCYXtiR9-bo/s720/2011-09-18%2520-%252017%2520-%2520Interesting%2520Piton%2520Placement.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;/td&gt;\r\n&lt;/tr&gt;\r\n&lt;tr&gt;\r\n&lt;td&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;&lt;b&gt;Sawed Off Piton Mashed Into a Hole&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;/td&gt;\r\n&lt;/tr&gt;\r\n&lt;/tbody&gt;\r\n&lt;/table&gt;\r\n&lt;/td&gt;\r\n&lt;td&gt;\r\n&lt;table&gt;\r\n&lt;tbody&gt;\r\n&lt;tr&gt;\r\n&lt;td&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-wiKrI3jyVzM/TowIGRaDMAI/AAAAAAAA2_U/kP6gIIh0aRE/s2000/2011-09-18%2520-%252017a%2520-%2520Nearing%2520the%2520end%2520of%2520P2-PaulKeller.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img height=\"500\" src=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-wiKrI3jyVzM/TowIGRaDMAI/AAAAAAAA2_U/kP6gIIh0aRE/s720/2011-09-18%2520-%252017a%2520-%2520Nearing%2520the%2520end%2520of%2520P2-PaulKeller.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;/td&gt;\r\n&lt;/tr&gt;\r\n&lt;tr&gt;\r\n&lt;td&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;&lt;b&gt;Finishing the Bolt Ladder&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;/td&gt;\r\n&lt;/tr&gt;\r\n&lt;/tbody&gt;\r\n&lt;/table&gt;\r\n&lt;/td&gt;\r\n&lt;/tr&gt;\r\n&lt;/tbody&gt;\r\n&lt;/table&gt;\r\n&lt;table&gt;\r\n&lt;tbody&gt;\r\n&lt;tr&gt;\r\n&lt;td&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-_M7g9JRgO4c/TowIQmvNLtI/AAAAAAAA3AU/sVw08bdr2ro/s2000/2011-09-18%2520-%252018a%2520-%2520Tourists%2520at%2520Yosemite%2520Falls%2520Overlook%2520Watching%2520Me-Dirk.JPG\"&gt;&lt;img height=\"450\" src=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-_M7g9JRgO4c/TowIQmvNLtI/AAAAAAAA3AU/sVw08bdr2ro/s1024/2011-09-18%2520-%252018a%2520-%2520Tourists%2520at%2520Yosemite%2520Falls%2520Overlook%2520Watching%2520Me-Dirk.JPG\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;/td&gt;\r\n&lt;/tr&gt;\r\n&lt;tr&gt;\r\n&lt;td&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;&lt;b&gt;Transitioning to Friction Slab&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;/td&gt;\r\n&lt;/tr&gt;\r\n&lt;/tbody&gt;\r\n&lt;/table&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;\r\nFrom this last bolt there is no pro until the summit anchors but the climbing is easy and gets easier the farther you go.

I can&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;t hear you!). I was timid making some moves and did so with an unhappy groan, but most of the gear on the route is pretty solid and I knew that if a piece blew I probably wouldn&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;t go any further than my last clip-in. Strangely, at every stage of the climbing the scariest part was the anticipation of getting into the &amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#152;scary part.&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153; Each time, once I started into it I was fine.\r\n&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;\r\n&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;table&gt;\r\n&lt;tbody&gt;\r\n&lt;tr&gt;\r\n&lt;td&gt;\r\n&lt;table&gt;\r\n&lt;tbody&gt;\r\n&lt;tr&gt;\r\n&lt;td&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-wIHg8fZ3U-4/TowID8hnZ3I/AAAAAAAA2_E/du3YE4mdYWA/s2000/2011-09-18%2520-%252023c%2520-%2520Eddy%2520Starting%2520P2-PaulKeller.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img height=\"340\" src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-wIHg8fZ3U-4/TowID8hnZ3I/AAAAAAAA2_E/du3YE4mdYWA/s720/2011-09-18%2520-%252023c%2520-%2520Eddy%2520Starting%2520P2-PaulKeller.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;/td&gt;\r\n&lt;/tr&gt;\r\n&lt;tr&gt;\r\n&lt;td&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;&lt;b&gt;Eddy Following P2&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;/td&gt;\r\n&lt;/tr&gt;\r\n&lt;/tbody&gt;\r\n&lt;/table&gt;\r\n&lt;/td&gt;\r\n&lt;td&gt;\r\n&lt;table&gt;\r\n&lt;tbody&gt;\r\n&lt;tr&gt;\r\n&lt;td&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-2P5Rk9bFbsI/TowIESSlWLI/AAAAAAAA2_I/ljZ97n3VzxQ/s2000/2011-09-18%2520-%252024a%2520-%2520Eddy%2520jumaring%2520up%2520P2-PaulKeller.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img height=\"340\" src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-2P5Rk9bFbsI/TowIESSlWLI/AAAAAAAA2_I/ljZ97n3VzxQ/s800/2011-09-18%2520-%252024a%2520-%2520Eddy%2520jumaring%2520up%2520P2-PaulKeller.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;/td&gt;\r\n&lt;/tr&gt;\r\n&lt;tr&gt;\r\n&lt;td&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;&lt;b&gt;Eddy Nearing the End of P2.

It was tied to his harness and he occasionally took in slack as we corkscrewed up the spire. By the time he reached the summit anchor the distance between us and the rim was only 140&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153; &amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#147; less than the length of one rope. \r\n&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;\r\nWe threaded the static line through the anchor and then fixed and hand tightened it. I would jug across first, trailing one of our extra ropes that was joined to the static line on the slack side of the fixed point. Once at the rim, Eddy would unfix the static line to let it slide freely through the pre-threaded anchor. I would take in slack and then fix my carried end to the tree anchor and hand tighten the new system. Eddy could then jug across. Once we were both across, we could release one end and pull the rope through the summit anchors and back to the Rim as if cleaning a horizontal rappel.\r\n&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;\r\n&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;table&gt;\r\n&lt;tbody&gt;\r\n&lt;tr&gt;\r\n&lt;td&gt;\r\n&lt;table&gt;\r\n&lt;tbody&gt;\r\n&lt;tr&gt;\r\n&lt;td&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-rdvr1wUXBzU/TowIHvuwaqI/AAAAAAAA2_c/f0Own6qqt0k/s2000/2011-09-18%2520-%252024c%2520-%2520Mark%2520Starting%2520Tyrolean-PaulKeller.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img height=\"280\" src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-rdvr1wUXBzU/TowIHvuwaqI/AAAAAAAA2_c/f0Own6qqt0k/s800/2011-09-18%2520-%252024c%2520-%2520Mark%2520Starting%2520Tyrolean-PaulKeller.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;/td&gt;\r\n&lt;/tr&gt;\r\n&lt;tr&gt;\r\n&lt;td&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;&lt;b&gt;Starting the Tyrolean Back to the Rim&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;/td&gt;\r\n&lt;/tr&gt;\r\n&lt;/tbody&gt;\r\n&lt;/table&gt;\r\n&lt;/td&gt;\r\n&lt;td&gt;\r\n&lt;table&gt;\r\n&lt;tbody&gt;\r\n&lt;tr&gt;\r\n&lt;td&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-0M5dxmMeNKg/TowIJizW2XI/AAAAAAAA2_w/X6RFdhHxP0o/s2000/2011-09-18%2520-%252024h%2520-%2520Mark%2520Starting%2520Tyrolean-PaulKeller.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img height=\"280\" src=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-0M5dxmMeNKg/TowIJizW2XI/AAAAAAAA2_w/X6RFdhHxP0o/s912/2011-09-18%2520-%252024h%2520-%2520Mark%2520Starting%2520Tyrolean-PaulKeller.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;/td&gt;\r\n&lt;/tr&gt;\r\n&lt;tr&gt;\r\n&lt;td&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;&lt;b&gt;Doing the Tyrolean Back to the Rim&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;/td&gt;\r\n&lt;/tr&gt;\r\n&lt;/tbody&gt;\r\n&lt;/table&gt;\r\n&lt;/td&gt;\r\n&lt;/tr&gt;\r\n&lt;/tbody&gt;\r\n&lt;/table&gt;\r\n&lt;table&gt;\r\n&lt;tbody&gt;\r\n&lt;tr&gt;\r\n&lt;td&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-EYJ90bSkLhE/TowIIDDrniI/AAAAAAAA2_g/okBY8IKekoo/s2000/2011-09-18%2520-%252024d%2520-%2520Mark%2520Starting%2520Tyrolean-PaulKeller.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-EYJ90bSkLhE/TowIIDDrniI/AAAAAAAA2_g/okBY8IKekoo/s720/2011-09-18%2520-%252024d%2520-%2520Mark%2520Starting%2520Tyrolean-PaulKeller.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\" width=\"400\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;/td&gt;\r\n&lt;/tr&gt;\r\n&lt;tr&gt;\r\n&lt;td&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;&lt;b&gt;Doing the Tyrolean Back to the Rim&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;/td&gt;\r\n&lt;/tr&gt;\r\n&lt;/tbody&gt;\r\n&lt;/table&gt;\r\n&lt;table&gt;\r\n&lt;tbody&gt;\r\n&lt;tr&gt;\r\n&lt;td&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-VKaAHV7IS2g/TowJYlHi61I/AAAAAAAA3Ac/RJ5Tiy95yDQ/s2000/2011-09-18%2520-%252024ee%2520-%2520Mark%2520Starting%2520Tyrolean-PaulKeller.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img height=\"400\" src=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-VKaAHV7IS2g/TowJYlHi61I/AAAAAAAA3Ac/RJ5Tiy95yDQ/s1024/2011-09-18%2520-%252024ee%2520-%2520Mark%2520Starting%2520Tyrolean-PaulKeller.jpg\" st'),(20,150,'/mountaineering/trip-reports/canada/cycling-and-scrambling-from-calgary-to-vancouver/part-v---crossing-the-coastal-range-to-vancouver','Part V - Crossing the Coastal Range to Vancouver','Part V - Crossing the Coastal Range to Vancouver','Trip_Report','content: &lt;div dir=\"ltr\"&gt;\r\n&lt;h1&gt;\r\n&lt;a name=\"TOC-Part-V---Crossing-the-Coastal-Range-to-Vancouver\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Part V - Crossing the Coastal Range to Vancouver&lt;/h1&gt;\r\n&lt;hr&gt;\r\n&lt;hr&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;a href=\"#Day17\"&gt;Day 17 &amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#147; Dying on the Duffy - Marble Canyon to Pemberton&lt;/a&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n-&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"#Day18\"&gt;Day 18 &amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#147; Running Out of Steam - Pemberton to Whistler&lt;/a&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n-&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"#Day19\"&gt;Day 19 &amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#147; Hiking on Mt.

The prize &amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#147; seeing Whistler, riding into Vancouver, and completing my trip. And if I failed? Then I would have a sad, long retreat as I biked to the nearest town with a Greyhound station, probably a full days&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153; ride away. \r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\nAlthough I would have loved to avoid The Duffy, there was no way around it to reach Whistler. Whistler only has two roads leading to the outside world &amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#147; Highway 99 (Sea to Sky Highway) to Vancouver, which was only completed in the 60&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;s, and the Duffy Lake Road. The Duffy Lake Road was created in the 1970s after it was realized that Whistler needed another road connection to the rest of British Columbia, as the rugged location of the Sea to Sky highway meant that it was regularly out of service due to avalanches and segments falling into the ocean in landslides.  \r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\nThere is a nice flat valley linking Lillooet with Pemberton, but this had already been filled with the Seton Lake Reservoir and a railroad. However, while a route for this backcountry access was being sought, a series of logging roads in the &lt;a href=\"http://www.summitpost.org/area/range/322175/lillooet-ranges.html\"&gt;Lillooet&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"http://www.summitpost.org/area/range/302233/cayoosh-range.html\"&gt;Cayoosh Mountains&lt;/a&gt; between Lillooet and Mt Curie grew together. So road planners just link together a route over the mountain range with the existing logging roads. As far as I know, the road was only paved in 1992. Beyond this and my research on Google Maps determining the elevation gain and road grades (many +10% slopes, none less than 5% for the first 1,500 ft), I had absolutely no information about the road or what to expect. \r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-M0YZVh4cklQ/ULXF5HD0jHI/AAAAAAABhPw/M-NOha4syqA/s2000/08%2520-%2520Marble%2520Canyon%2520to%2520Pemberton%2520Comparison%2520Duffy.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-M0YZVh4cklQ/ULXF5HD0jHI/AAAAAAABhPw/M-NOha4syqA/s800/08%2520-%2520Marble%2520Canyon%2520to%2520Pemberton%2520Comparison%2520Duffy.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Comparisons of the Duffy Lake Road to other cycling climbs&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\nThat was until yesterday when a local ranger at Marble Canyon eased my fears by saying the road had decent shoulders (so I could stop or walk by bike if things got desperate), somewhat regular cycling traffic, and that I could easily access the creek throughout the canyon to refill water. In light of this information, I traveled at half capacity with water. Since the pass looked to span the middle 1/3 of the Coastal Range, I also expected a lush, cool mountain pass. Between this information and expectations, and the fact that I had made it to here from Calgary without using my granny gear, I felt confident that I could make it over the pass, even with 80 lbs of gear. And once that was over, I only had a short ways on flat ground to reach the hostel in Pemberton.&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\nI had hoped to make it to Lillooet the day before, as it is the last town before the pass, making it an ideal starting point. But I was wearing down enough from the long distances and intensive heat that I fell short, spending the night 30 miles away in the very nice Marble Canyon Campground. I rose early and was on the road by 8 am. As I descended out of the Pavilion Range through the town of Pavilion, the landscape changed again from cool green forests to hot dry and rocky grasslands and arid mountains. I had two good humps to get over as I reached Fountain, and then a nice long downhill towards the surprisingly arid town of Lillooet. Annoyingly, I had to climb a steep hill and backtrack up the canyon several miles after leaving the highway to reach Lillooet, but I couldn&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;t pass up an opportunity to have a good last meal before the crux of the trip. \r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;table&gt;\r\n&lt;tbody&gt;\r\n&lt;tr&gt;\r\n&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-tb72lZh28Wc/ULXGUz_yNfI/AAAAAAABhT8/vj5fQdZ-8l0/s2000/2008-08-14%2520-%252001%2520-%2520Biking%2520to%2520Lillooete.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-tb72lZh28Wc/ULXGUz_yNfI/AAAAAAABhT8/vj5fQdZ-8l0/s400/2008-08-14%2520-%252001%2520-%2520Biking%2520to%2520Lillooete.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\r\n&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-1apc2Xc1SCQ/ULXGWLpZGtI/AAAAAAABhUE/5TZBrowU89g/s2000/2008-08-14%2520-%252002%2520-%2520Biking%2520to%2520Lillooete.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-1apc2Xc1SCQ/ULXGWLpZGtI/AAAAAAABhUE/5TZBrowU89g/s400/2008-08-14%2520-%252002%2520-%2520Biking%2520to%2520Lillooete.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\r\n&lt;/tr&gt;\r\n&lt;/tbody&gt;\r\n&lt;/table&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Approaching Fountain&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\nI had a large chicken teriyaki sandwich at Subway and a lot of sides to top off for the ride, chugging as much water as I could as I hung around the restaurant. I tried to procrastinate and delay the inevitable, but by 10:30 am I decided I had better get moving, so I headed out. By this time it had gotten very hot outside and my bike thermometer was already reading 95&lt;sup&gt;o&lt;/sup&gt; F! I learned later that despite appearing to be 1/3 of the way into the Coastal Range from the interior, Lillooete was actually one of the hottest towns in British Columbia! This was an added difficulty for the climb I had not expected.&amp;Acirc;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-zobtoXf81aE/ULXGY06IFOI/AAAAAAABhUU/AxWTIRYYBHg/s2000/2008-08-14%2520-%252004%2520-%2520Lillooete.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-zobtoXf81aE/ULXGY06IFOI/AAAAAAABhUU/AxWTIRYYBHg/s800/2008-08-14%2520-%252004%2520-%2520Lillooete.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Lillooet&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\nAfter I left town, it wasn&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;t long before I hit the start of the major hill climbing. I had a nice warm-up of a short 11% hill &amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#147; my steepest yet. Here I finally broke out my secret weapon and switched to the third chain ring Granny Gear on my bike. This was as easy as it was going to get. The hill didn&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;t last very long before flattening at a viewpoint of the Seton Lake Reservoir, the watery barrier that blocked an easy flat route to Pemberton. I enjoyed my last few minutes of relative comfort for the day here, looking at the flat reservoir winding away through the mountains, and then up at the Duffy Lake Road as it switch-backed up a headwall to enter the canyon above. And then I launched into my assault in full force.&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;table&gt;\r\n&lt;tbody&gt;\r\n&lt;tr&gt;\r\n&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-moUrldlJlZI/ULXGaKmnfXI/AAAAAAABhUc/rOKnJyy1kEE/s2000/2008-08-14%2520-%252013%2520-%2520Starting%2520the%2520Duffy.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-moUrldlJlZI/ULXGaKmnfXI/AAAAAAABhUc/rOKnJyy1kEE/s400/2008-08-14%2520-%252013%2520-%2520Starting%2520the%2520Duffy.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\r\n&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-viuysqiRq9k/ULXGdFC4BiI/AAAAAAABhUw/5ua6i8IzefQ/s2000/2008-08-14%2520-%252015%2520-%2520Reservoir.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-viuysqiRq9k/ULXGdFC4BiI/AAAAAAABhUw/5ua6i8IzefQ/s400/2008-08-14%2520-%252015%2520-%2520Reservoir.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\r\n&lt;/tr&gt;\r\n&lt;tr&gt;\r\n&lt;td&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Duffy Lake Pass&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;/td&gt;\r\n&lt;td&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Seton Lake, blocking the easy way to Pemberton&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;/td&gt;\r\n&lt;/tr&gt;\r\n&lt;/tbody&gt;\r\n&lt;/table&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\nI dropped into my lowest gear, and despite attempting to go as easily as I could, the sustained steepness of the road soon began to get to me. I had to concentrate extremely hard on every muscle contraction to push through pedal revolutions. Creeping uphill at a depressing 3 mph, I tried my best to NOT pay any attention to reaching the top &amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#147; I would get there when I got there. I began to take mini breaks every 5-10 minutes, and despite the intense pedaling an ensuing soreness and nausea, I didn&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;t stop for reason of fatigue. Instead, I stopped for the intense heat as temperatures were in the mid to high 90s and the road was NOT shaded here. I tried to ride slow mostly to keep from overheating, but despite my best efforts, nausea would creep in and my heart rate would rise into the high 180s. This was O.K., but as soon as I started to feel chills in my spine, arms, legs, or head, I immediately stopped and guzzled water to avoid the imminent onset of heat exhaustion.\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\nI think Connie was thinking more about the majority of the pass and not the first headwall, which is passed quickly in a car, when she said the road was shaded and water was accessible. Ascending on the steep canyon wall, there was absolutely no access to water. Even though the first climbing only lasts for about 5 miles, it is so steep that I was on it for well over an hour. Between time spent on the climb and the intense heat, I soon ran out of water, cursing Connie&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;s suggestion to carry less as I sucked the last few drops out of my camelback.\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\nAt one point I reached one of the steepest sections of the road (about 15% is my best estimate based on topos and the road grade signs) as it wound through another series of 180 degree switch backs up the mountainside. The shoulder narrowed, and as I was wary of riding too far out in the road, I hugged the side, a few inches away from a concrete k-rail. At my slow speed on the steep slope, I couldn&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;t help but wobble a bit, especially when the (fortunately) rare car passed (no R.V.s here!). \r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;div style=\"text-align:center\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/--jcRDi_w9cc/ULXGeouw23I/AAAAAAABhU4/fPGR_3kbcHY/s2000/2008-08-14%2520-%252016%2520-%2520Gravel%2520Section%2520past%2520accident.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/--jcRDi_w9cc/ULXGeouw23I/AAAAAAABhU4/fPGR_3kbcHY/s800/2008-08-14%2520-%252016%2520-%2520Gravel%2520Section%2520past%2520accident.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;\r\n&lt;div style=\"text-align:center\"&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Walking my bike on the unpaved section. My \'incident\' happened at the curve below&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\r\n&lt;/b&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\nAs I neared the second switchback, I grazed the k-rail with my front right pannier, and in one slow &amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#156;rrrrrrrip!&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#157; the concrete wall pried the entire pannier mount off my front wheel! Unbalanced, the front wheel swung outwards and I stood up on the road to avoid toppling over. &lt;b&gt;Crap!&lt;/b&gt; and a variety of other obscenities  poured forth. This was NOT what I needed right now. I walked my bike up to the switchback where there was more space on the outside of the road to inspect the damage. A critical piece holding my pannier to my bike was a very long screw that was perhaps close to 2&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#157; long. Fortunately the screw had bent and then snapped in the center as the pannier was pried off, breaking far away from the threads in my bike frame and pannier mount, and nothing else was broken. Unfortunately, out of all of the spare parts I brought, I had neglected to bring such long screws for the front pannier mount (I had replacement screws for every other part of my bike, though).\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\nIt would be impossible to continue riding with this breakdown, and although I didn&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;t have any way to reattach the pannier, in lack of any better ideas, I plopped down on the roadside and began untwisting the bent pieces of screws out of my bike with pliers.\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;div style=\"text-align:center\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-lax1o732iww/ULXGfuF8ZwI/AAAAAAABhVA/Ki6jLbPpONQ/s2000/2008-08-14%2520-%252017%2520-%2520Mountains%2520S%2520of%2520the%2520road.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-lax1o732iww/ULXGfuF8ZwI/AAAAAAABhVA/Ki6jLbPpONQ/s800/2008-08-14%2520-%252017%2520-%2520Mountains%2520S%2520of%2520the%2520road.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\r\n&lt;div style=\"text-align:center\"&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Mountains above the Duffy Lake road.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\nIn a second incredibly lucky break on my trip, it was only about 10 minutes before a van stopped on the pullout to see if I was all right. Riding in the van were Aniel and Mark, from Boulder, Colorado. They were physicists working at the university there, and Aniel was now moving to a position in Fairbanks, so Mark was driving Aniel up there, taking some detours along the way for a scenic road trip. Inside of their van, then, they just happened to have all types of spare parts for vehicle repair (their van was a piece of crap that had to be fixed several times already) and lab equipment. They might have some spare parts to fix my breakdown! After moving out of the way for a logging truck that was attempting to make the turn around the tight switchback, my saviors set to work helping me out.\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\nAniel and Mark also had gallons of extra water, and while Aniel tried various screws to find one long enough and the right diameter for my pannier, Mark filled up my camel back and two more liters of water bottles. And Aniel found a screw that worked! It was a little long, but barely short enough to fit in through the pannier mount and screw into the bike frame. Bizarrely, tearing off my front pannier was extremely fortunate for me, as it was quickly repaired and incidentally solved my serious water problem.\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\nWe said our farewells and parted ways. But I wasn&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;t on the move for long before I reached a short 100 yard section of road that was unpaved. The vehicles driving uphill had to slow down to gain traction in the soft soil, and even the cars had trouble driving up this section. There was no way I was going to even attempt to ride up that, so I dismounted and walked my bike uphill through it. Between the steep hill and my heavy bike, this was surprisingly tiring. Although my slow 3mph climbing speed on my bike was slow enough to tempt me to walk, it was apparent now that it was actually still faster and easier to ride my bike up these hills rather than walking it.\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\nShortly after I finished the dirt road section and resumed cycling, I came across a man lounging on the rear hatch of his pickup truck on a shady roadside pullout. He was really surprised to see me and my touring rig heading up the pass, and as I crawled by huffing and puffing, he said in astonishment, &amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#156;You&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;re a better man than I.&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#157; By the minute I was feeling crazier and crazier for attempting the pass loaded down like this.\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\nAfter what seemed like an eternity, I crested the hill and dropped down steeply on the other side. I crossed a 1-lane wooden bridge as the road crossed the canyon and resumed its ascent on the other side. The grade stayed high, but each hill was shorter and shorter, offering some short reprieve to rest up for the next climb. At the last steep hill, as I crawled over the crest and the valley below rolled away behind the crest off the road, I turned around to see a sign saying &amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#156;Trucks Gear Down. 13% for 2 km,&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#157; and this section didn&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;t even feel like the worst one!\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\nAt last I was over the worst of the climb, and I knew that I was going to make it. I was going slow enough that I didn&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;t know if I could make it to Pemberton that night, but at least I was going to finish the ride eventually. I had finally climbed high enough that the air had cooled and I was once again surrounded by thick pine forest. The rest of the climb was bittersweet. The road grades had eased up to manageable levels again, and I only had to net 2,000 ft more climbing over 40 miles to reach the pass. But the road was not very fully developed, and it rose and fell with every undulation in the terrain, sometimes climbing high up on the side of the canyon before dropping back down again to follow the river or cross to the other side. These undulations were hard on the morale, especially the ones where the hills dropped down so far that the road disappeared from sight and I couldn&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;t see where it resumed climbing again.\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;table&gt;\r\n&lt;tbody&gt;\r\n&lt;tr&gt;\r\n&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-WgRdlmOGhjk/ULXGlmWQ4II/AAAAAAABhVg/_snxwUnXsTU/s2000/2008-08-14%2520-%252021%2520-%2520View%2520along%2520the%2520Duffy.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-WgRdlmOGhjk/ULXGlmWQ4II/AAAAAAABhVg/_snxwUnXsTU/s400/2008-08-14%2520-%252021%2520-%2520View%2520along%2520the%2520Duffy.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\r\n&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-gk_HYrQB6q0/ULXGm-UjgaI/AAAAAAABhVo/yKIYL2IjAMI/s2000/2008-08-14%2520-%252022%2520-%2520Ups%2520and%2520Downs.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-gk_HYrQB6q0/ULXGm-UjgaI/AAAAAAABhVo/yKIYL2IjAMI/s400/2008-08-14%2520-%252022%2520-%2520Ups%2520and%2520Downs.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\r\n&lt;/tr&gt;\r\n&lt;tr&gt;\r\n&lt;td&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;Still climbing?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;/td&gt;\r\n&lt;td&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;Still have more to climb!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;/td&gt;\r\n&lt;/tr&gt;\r\n&lt;/tbody&gt;\r\n&lt;/table&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\nBut I was enjoying myself, admiring the views and making good progress once again. At least the road was very picturesque, offering occasional views over the forest, and every now and then crossing the canyon creek over old 1-lane wooden bridges. By this time there was more road traffic as I began to pass trailheads and picnic areas. Many of the car travelers honked their horns and cheered as they passed by, congratulating me for making it up here loaded up as I was.&amp;Acirc;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;table&gt;\r\n&lt;tbody&gt;\r\n&lt;tr&gt;\r\n&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-n0m77bW_-Dk/ULXGsHpNdrI/AAAAAAABhWI/LwRESaXA0rg/s2000/2008-08-14%2520-%252026%2520-%2520Wooden%2520Bridge.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-n0m77bW_-Dk/ULXGsHpNdrI/AAAAAAABhWI/LwRESaXA0rg/s400/2008-08-14%2520-%252026%2520-%2520Wooden%2520Bridge.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\r\n&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-F7_DUOo2Tsg/ULXGp7Wo1fI/AAAAAAABhV4/_OgfksGU_Yw/s2000/2008-08-14%2520-%252024%2520-%2520Wooden%2520Bridge.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-F7_DUOo2Tsg/ULXGp7Wo1fI/AAAAAAABhV4/_OgfksGU_Yw/s400/2008-08-14%2520-%252024%2520-%2520Wooden%2520Bridge.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\r\n&lt;/tr&gt;\r\n&lt;/tbody&gt;\r\n&lt;/table&gt;\r\n&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;The old wooden bridges on the \"Duffy\"&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;Foliage on the Duffy&lt;/b&gt;\r\n&lt;table&gt;\r\n&lt;tbody&gt;\r\n&lt;tr&gt;\r\n&lt;td&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-35_nojHDWTU/ULXGrPnsqyI/AAAAAAABhWA/r28ECzeYBkQ/s2000/2008-08-14%2520-%252025%2520-%2520Puffy%2520thing.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-35_nojHDWTU/ULXGrPnsqyI/AAAAAAABhWA/r28ECzeYBkQ/s400/2008-08-14%2520-%252025%2520-%2520Puffy%2520thing.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;/td&gt;\r\n&lt;td&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-g66o7AKJRr4/ULXGuCwXDWI/AAAAAAABhWY/bgfItMcQw8k/s2000/2008-08-14%2520-%252028%2520-%2520Cool%2520Flowers.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-g66o7AKJRr4/ULXGuCwXDWI/AAAAAAABhWY/bgfItMcQw8k/s400/2008-08-14%2520-%252028%2520-%2520Cool%2520Flowers.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;/td&gt;\r\n&lt;/tr&gt;\r\n&lt;tr&gt;\r\n&lt;td&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-C3mkCnXUniY/ULXGu8q_lPI/AAAAAAABhWk/tMclwpQqqbM/s2000/2008-08-14%2520-%252029%2520-%2520Cool%2520Flowers.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-C3mkCnXUniY/ULXGu8q_lPI/AAAAAAABhWk/tMclwpQqqbM/s400/2008-08-14%2520-%252029%2520-%2520Cool%2520Flowers.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;/td&gt;\r\n&lt;td&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-uJg6vLuS41c/ULXGvzUmitI/AAAAAAABhWs/iOBL-h2CUr4/s2000/2008-08-14%2520-%252030%2520-%2520Cool%2520Flowers.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-uJg6vLuS41c/ULXGvzUmitI/AAAAAAABhWs/iOBL-h2CUr4/s400/2008-08-14%2520-%252030%2520-%2520Cool%2520Flowers.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;/td&gt;\r\n&lt;/tr&gt;\r\n&lt;/tbody&gt;\r\n&lt;/table&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-nlnCnu6GzIY/ULXGoQANO7I/AAAAAAABhVw/cUovlx9rLLs/s2000/2008-08-14%2520-%252023%2520-%2520View%2520along%2520the%2520Duffy.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-nlnCnu6GzIY/ULXGoQANO7I/AAAAAAABhVw/cUovlx9rLLs/s400/2008-08-14%2520-%252023%2520-%2520View%2520along%2520the%2520Duffy.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\nOne highlight of the day was meeting the &lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;beer goddess&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt; (sorry, I have lost her name since then). I was cycling along on a straightaway when an SUV pulled up alongside of me and matched my speed. The window rolled down and inside was a kid and his young mother. She hailed me and I took out my headphones to see what was up. She just wanted to chat, curious about what I was doing, so as I rode along on the road we visited, occasionally taking breaks to let cars pass.\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-Id3P65nQAA8/ULXGtNbAI9I/AAAAAAABhWQ/cOtbsGqs5xg/s2000/2008-08-14%2520-%252027%2520-%2520Awesome%2520Beer%2520Lady.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-Id3P65nQAA8/ULXGtNbAI9I/AAAAAAABhWQ/cOtbsGqs5xg/s300/2008-08-14%2520-%252027%2520-%2520Awesome%2520Beer%2520Lady.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;Beer Goddess and her son&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\nFinally the &lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;beer goddess&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt; said she needed to get going on her way and tool off, but a few minutes later she came speeding back the other way, turned around, and pulled up alongside me again.\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\nWould I like a beer to celebrate my imminent completion of The Duffy?\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\n&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#156;Of course!&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#157; I said, &amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#156;Although I can&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;t drink it now. I&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;m so exhausted and dehydrated that I don&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;t want to get drunk before the descent into Pemberton.&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#157;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\nInsistent on giving me the beer, the &lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;beer goddess&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt; said she would find a pull-out where she could leave it for me to pick up, so she sped off to hide the beer. Then she sped back to report that she wanted to make sure I didn&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;t miss it, so she followed me a while longer and as she told me about things to do in and around Vancouver and how nice and accommodating everyone in the area was.

Tonight I was set on reaching the comfort of the Pemberton Hostel, so I picked up the pace.\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;Duffy Lake and Pass&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-aRCrdvRvQmg/ULXGyRLLqNI/AAAAAAABhXE/jeZKxA3LU4E/s2000/2008-08-14%2520-%252033%2520-%2520Duffy%2520Lake.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-aRCrdvRvQmg/ULXGyRLLqNI/AAAAAAABhXE/jeZKxA3LU4E/s800/2008-08-14%2520-%252033%2520-%2520Duffy%2520Lake.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;table&gt;\r\n&lt;tbody&gt;\r\n&lt;tr&gt;\r\n&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-sdWj0rmjqNw/ULXGxfZ0fnI/AAAAAAABhW8/eqM0Q9IpvqY/s2000/2008-08-14%2520-%252032%2520-%2520Duffy%2520Lake.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-sdWj0rmjqNw/ULXGxfZ0fnI/AAAAAAABhW8/eqM0Q9IpvqY/s400/2008-08-14%2520-%252032%2520-%2520Duffy%2520Lake.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\r\n&lt;td&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-dcsdbAam2as/ULXGzWyl5yI/AAAAAAABhXM/jOS7KbKFsac/s2000/2008-08-14%2520-%252035%2520-%2520Cool%2520Mtns.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-dcsdbAam2as/ULXGzWyl5yI/AAAAAAABhXM/jOS7KbKFsac/s400/2008-08-14%2520-%252035%2520-%2520Cool%2520Mtns.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;/td&gt;\r\n&lt;/tr&gt;\r\n&lt;tr&gt;\r\n&lt;td&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-iWj14xmQ9zM/ULXGz34ye3I/AAAAAAABhXU/KcMe9vdOPP0/s2000/2008-08-14%2520-%252036%2520-%2520Cool%2520Mtns.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-iWj14xmQ9zM/ULXGz34ye3I/AAAAAAABhXU/KcMe9vdOPP0/s400/2008-08-14%2520-%252036%2520-%2520Cool%2520Mtns.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;/td&gt;\r\n&lt;td&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-wL00paarI6M/ULXG2FEwmtI/AAAAAAABhXs/qdJOGDpjJzQ/s2000/2008-08-14%2520-%252039%2520-%2520Cool%2520Mtn.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-wL00paarI6M/ULXG2FEwmtI/AAAAAAABhXs/qdJOGDpjJzQ/s400/2008-08-14%2520-%252039%2520-%2520Cool%2520Mtn.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;/td&gt;\r\n&lt;/tr&gt;\r\n&lt;/tbody&gt;\r\n&lt;/table&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\nI was blown away by the beauty of Duffy Lake. The view came up all at once, with no warning &amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#147; a beautiful alpine lake lined with flowers, and rising in the distance, a rocky, ice-covered summit. I was officially in the Cascade Range. \r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;div style=\"text-align:center\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-1it9fouDZEs/ULXG1a3XI0I/AAAAAAABhXk/bRSOvgb6D7c/s2000/2008-08-14%2520-%252038%2520-%2520Racing%2520Downhill.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-1it9fouDZEs/ULXG1a3XI0I/AAAAAAABhXk/bRSOvgb6D7c/s800/2008-08-14%2520-%252038%2520-%2520Racing%2520Downhill.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\r\n&lt;div style=\"text-align:center\"&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Descending the Duffy&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\nThe road followed the lakeside with wonderful views the entire way, and then went through a couple more false summits before the final rise. It was getting dark &amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#147; maybe only another 15-20 minutes of visible light &amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#147; but the descent would be very fast, dropping 3,500 ft in about 8 miles. It was time to go for it! I pulled hard on the brakes as I passed a sign saying &amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#156;Caution. Extreme Grades Next 13 km. Brake Check.&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#157; The road really &lt;i&gt;dropped&lt;/i&gt; at this point, and my hands were staining under the effort to pull my brake levers, trying to keep my speed reasonable for the hairpin turns that I knew were coming.\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\nBefore I knew it I had descended from 4,200 ft to 750 ft above sea level just as it got dark. From here on the road was completely flat, and I raced to Pemberton in the fading light. Just as it seemed about to get pitch black, the sun came out from behind some thick clouds behind the horizon, and lit up the smooth, velvety clouds in the sky and creating one of the most impressive sunsets I have ever witnessed. The sky was an errie green-blue at the horizon, a silhouette of mountain peaks. Above this layer of color was a smooth sheet of clouds covering the sky and glowing fiery orange, gold, pink, and red as the sun set, fading into the blackness of the night sky above as one looked higher. I could hear the angels singing, so to speak, as this beacon of light shown above my destination for the night.\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;Mt Curie Sunset&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-Wr3eeu4WSqE/ULXG5IGJ11I/AAAAAAABhYU/QkSnnQTFjAM/s2000/2008-08-14%2520-%252044%2520-%2520Pemberton%2520Sunset.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-Wr3eeu4WSqE/ULXG5IGJ11I/AAAAAAABhYU/QkSnnQTFjAM/s800/2008-08-14%2520-%252044%2520-%2520Pemberton%2520Sunset.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;table&gt;\r\n&lt;tbody&gt;\r\n&lt;tr&gt;\r\n&lt;td&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-1aAELMt6ZjY/ULXG3eOLw2I/AAAAAAABhX8/hoz6WNH9Ylg/s2000/2008-08-14%2520-%252041%2520-%2520Pemberton%2520Sunset.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-1aAELMt6ZjY/ULXG3eOLw2I/AAAAAAABhX8/hoz6WNH9Ylg/s400/2008-08-14%2520-%252041%2520-%2520Pemberton%2520Sunset.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;/td&gt;\r\n&lt;td&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-PXDkaNU_wuk/ULXG4t0DenI/AAAAAAABhYM/NW5jyzg5pJw/s2000/2008-08-14%2520-%252043%2520-%2520Pemberton%2520Sunset.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-PXDkaNU_wuk/ULXG4t0DenI/AAAAAAABhYM/NW5jyzg5pJw/s400/2008-08-14%2520-%252043%2520-%2520Pemberton%2520Sunset.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;/td&gt;\r\n&lt;/tr&gt;\r\n&lt;/tbody&gt;\r\n&lt;/table&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\nI thought my day was over, but there was still more to come.  As it turned out, the directions I had printed out from Google Maps to the hostel were incorrect. As I rode along in the dark, I found the road it was supposed to be on, only to reach a dead end and fields beyond. Just as I came to this, realizing that there was no hostel here, I looked to me right to see the backlit silhouette of a woman, waving to me from her front porch.\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\n&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#156;Great,&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#157; I thought, &amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#156;maybe she can help give me directions to the hostel.&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#157;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\nI turned around and rode up to the house to explain my situation. The blonde woman was in her early 30s and &lt;i&gt;very&lt;/i&gt; outgoing, probably aided by the drink in her hand. I explained my problem and she said that that address was actually on the other side of the highway, but there was a good shortcut through the field at the end of the road. Great, I would just head over there. But just then the woman&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;s younger blonde sister, in her early 20s, and her perky friend popped up at the door, also very outgoing and mildly drunk.\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\n&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#156;What are you doing out here?  . . . Really?! Wow, that is sooooo cool (imagine some valley girl talk here) &amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#156;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\nI said I should get going to the hostel since I needed to get dinner and some sleep so I could press on tomorrow and one of the girls said &amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#156;oh, come on. Come to the bar with us! You can get food there!&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#157;  The older woman suggested we call the hostel to make sure there was room.\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\n&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#156;Yes, they have space, but the lady sounded crazzzy. I don&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;t think you should stay there &amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#147; she sounded really off and a little grouchy. You can stay here! Really!&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#157;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\n&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#156;Oh yes!&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#157; said the two younger girls. &amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#156;You should stay with us! It&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;s just the three of here, so we have space &amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#147; a hide-a-bed in the living room. You can get your food and some drinks at the bar with us and then come back here! Pleeeassse!&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#157;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;Ummmmmmmmm . . . . is this for real?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"http://media.beta.photobucket.com/user/Think_of_Me/media/ZOOTWALL_preview.png.html?filters%5Bterm%5D=zoot%20castle%20anthrax%20holy%20grail%20monty%20python&amp;amp;filters%5Bprimary%5D=images&amp;amp;o=1\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"http://i2.photobucket.com/albums/y27/Think_of_Me/ZOOTWALL_preview.png\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;\"Welcome to the Castle Anthrax.

Ultimately I gave in, as this was just too strange to pass up.\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\nWhat followed was a feast of food and alcohol as I ate several heaping plates of virtually free chicken wings, about 4 or 5 beers, and several shots with the girls and their friends at the bar. No, nothing else happened &amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#147; it was a sweet innocent night of R&amp;amp;R, mingling with locals in the bar. By the time we got back to the girls&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153; place, I was dead tired and fell right asleep.\r\n\r\n&lt;a name=\"Day18\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\r\n&lt;h2&gt;\r\n&lt;a name=\"TOC-Day-18-Running-Out-of-Steam---Pemberton-to-Whistler\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Day 18 &amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#147; Running Out of Steam - &lt;i&gt;Pemberton to Whistler&lt;/i&gt;\r\n&lt;/h2&gt;\r\n&lt;hr&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-Ap6Rwom3bis/ULXGFWWUQtI/AAAAAAABhRg/JTxbF9s_WNY/s2000/09%2520-%2520Pemberton-Whistler%2520-%2520Route%2520Map.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-Ap6Rwom3bis/ULXGFWWUQtI/AAAAAAABhRg/JTxbF9s_WNY/s800/09%2520-%2520Pemberton-Whistler%2520-%2520Route%2520Map.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-bLOWqKuEM8E/ULXGDqMH-uI/AAAAAAABhRQ/ZWYvmmGjPe4/s2000/09%2520-%2520Pemberton%2520to%2520Whistler%2520Elevation%2520Profile.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-bLOWqKuEM8E/ULXGDqMH-uI/AAAAAAABhRQ/ZWYvmmGjPe4/s800/09%2520-%2520Pemberton%2520to%2520Whistler%2520Elevation%2520Profile.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;u&gt;\r\nBy Bike:&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/b&gt;\r\n&lt;ul&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;Distance: 23.5 miles\r\n&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;Elevation Gain: 2,440 ft\r\n&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;/ul&gt;\r\n\r\nI slept soundly last night, utterly wasted from my ordeal on the Duffy. This morning I awoke with a mild headache from dehydration and last night&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;s drinking. Ugggg . . . I felt better after chugging water, but I was still completely exhausted and very sore, half-limping around the kitchen as I gathered my things. Today would normally be an easy day, cycling about 20 miles and gaining 2,500 ft to Whistler, where I planned to spend the next few days climbing out of the Lake Garibaldi area. I felt so sore and weak that I dreaded the thought of more hills, but excitement for hiking and scrambling in the Coastal Range drove me onward.\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\nIn an attempt to recover, I ate two full breakfasts at a restaurant in town, taking my time and starting out stuffed at around 11 am. As I cycled out of town, despite the ground being flat, it was slow and painful pushing the pedals &amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#147; my legs felt as if they were seizing up. Although I had made it over the Duffy, the +300 miles covered over the last 3 days had been too much, and my physical condition was definitely deteriorating - definitely a good time to wrap up the trip! About a mile out of town I heard a sudden &amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#156;whump!&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#157; behind me and my rear wheel locked up. Unable to peddle further, I stopped cold, turning around to see that my rear rack had just broken, dropping all of my gear onto the rear wheel. \r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;table align=\"right\" cellpadding=\"5%\"&gt;\r\n&lt;tbody&gt;\r\n&lt;tr&gt;\r\n&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-siutmnPWPmE/ULXFlB5mSDI/AAAAAAABhNA/HiTxZkaRXSA/s2000/2008-08-15%2520-%252002%2520-%2520Rack%2520Damage%2520Label.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-siutmnPWPmE/ULXFlB5mSDI/AAAAAAABhNA/HiTxZkaRXSA/s300/2008-08-15%2520-%252002%2520-%2520Rack%2520Damage%2520Label.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\r\n&lt;/tr&gt;\r\n&lt;tr&gt;\r\n&lt;td&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;Rack Damage&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;/td&gt;\r\n&lt;/tr&gt;\r\n&lt;/tbody&gt;\r\n&lt;/table&gt;\r\n\r\nFortunately, this wasn&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;t a repeat of the dreaded screw-shearing incident. This time the metal underwent a clean, brittle fracture. My best guess is all of the bumpy riding (especially on the Duffy) caused a fatigue fracture in the metal, since the fracture wasn&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;t initiated by any sudden shock to the system. Unable to move the bike with 60 lbs of gear on the rear, I filled up my Andanista pack with as much as I could, balanced the rest of my gear on the bicycle seat, and walked back into town.\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\nOnce again I had a breakdown that would have been impossible to fix on the road, and once again I got very lucky. I saw a bike show in Pemberton on my way out, so I walked back there, purchased a new rear rack (which barely had sufficient capacity for the weight) and replaced the broken one. I thought it was interesting to see that I had beaten up my broken rack so badly that the screw threads in the clevis head was stretched from the heavy weight that had been bearing on the screw. Repairs went straightforward, and I continued a long, uneventful slog up into Whistler.\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\nThe canyon wasn&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;t too scenic, and once again I was riding on the shoulder of a highway, with traffic screaming by. It turns out that British Columbia also has a bad habit of marring scenic views from the road by strategically stringing high voltage power lines across the views. I then hit major construction as I reached Whistler. Apparently Whistler is next in line to hold the Winter Olympics (I had no idea!) and I found out that the Whistler area and the entire highway into Vancouver was undergoing major construction in preparations for the Olympics.\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\nTonight I planned to stay in the Whistler Hostel, which is across Alta Lake from the town. Picturesque yes, but also fairly isolated. I cycled over 2 last painful humps, and as I coasted up to the garage for the hostel, took a spill as I caught my feet trying to take them out of the toe-clips. I was tired.\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\nAt the hostel I found that it was full! M.C., the desk guy there, was really great as although there weren&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;t any vacancies, it was late in the day and there was a private room who&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;s occupants still hadn&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;t arrived. He thought it a safe assumption that they weren&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;t going to show, so he gave me the room for the night.\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\nAs I checked the weather that night, I was disappointed to see that the earlier forecasts for clear weather in the area had been replaced by a week of stormy weather starting in 2-3 days. Not good for mountain climbing, and I didn&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;t want to be caught in the rain when cycling along the Sea-to-Sky Highway, which was now one long construction zone. I would have to nix my plans to scramble up the Black Tusk and other peaks in the Lake Garibaldi area.\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\nI decided that I would have a casual day around town tomorrow to recover, and then head into Vancouver early to beat the rain.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n&lt;h2&gt;\r\n&lt;a name=\"TOC-Day-19-Hiking-on-Mt.-Whistler---Rest-Day\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Day 19 &amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#147; Hiking on Mt.

I took my time enjoying breakfast and admiring the nice view of Alta Lake and Whistler Peak rising above.  I wasn&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;t in any hurry to get moving, and I was still unsure what to do with the remainder of my trip. I was too tired to do much today, and the imminent rainy weather put a stop to all of my plans for hiking and scrambling in the Coastal Range, leaving me in a downer mood.  Also, I needed to figure out how I was going to get into Vancouver.\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\nAs I worked my way across Western Canada, I learned more about the Sea-to-Sky highway from locals, and the news wasn&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;t good for me, especially after my close call crossing Roger&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;s Pass. First, the entire length of the highway from Whistler to Vancouver was essentially one long construction zone in preparation for the upcoming Winter Olympics. Second, the road before the construction had very tight turns and bad shoulders. Apparently enough cyclists are hit by drivers rushing between Whistler and Vancouver that some people call the highway the &amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#156;Sea-to-Die Highway&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#157;. On top of that, the forecast was for rain in 2 days, which could possibly break while I am en route to Vancouver.\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\nUpon hearing my debate on what to do, one of the guests in the hostel strongly warned me not to do it. He was driving a van for hire and was already taking some clients into the city today. I could play it safe and join him. Still, he did have a conflict of interest since I would be paying for the ride. Also, it seemed a real shame to have come all this way only to stop short of reaching Vancouver, or even the West Coast. \r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\nM.C. helped me out here, suggesting that I could at least cycle to Squamish, and if the weather got bad or construction was too bad, I could then bus the last stretch along the coast. As to my reservations about the highway, a lot of the judgments I had heard were second-hand and casual observations from drivers and not cyclists. Yes, it could be dangerous, but was it really any worse than many of the miles I had already cycled? Although most cyclists in the area were mountain bikers, M.C. knew of a bike shop in Squamish rid employees that were into road cycling, and a call there confirmed that yes, the road was a little tight, but from the point of view of one guy who cycled it regularly, it was perfectly safe in good weather if you were careful and highly visible (e.g. my tall orange flag would help a lot). In the end I decided to go for it, and if the weather deteriorated early, then I would take a bus from Squamish as a backup.\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;div style=\"text-align:center\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-Vr-8b-UB6sc/ULXG_9pqs0I/AAAAAAABhZM/B-dAinebT5o/s2000/2008-08-16%2520-%252010%2520-%2520Overlord%2520Mtn.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-Vr-8b-UB6sc/ULXG_9pqs0I/AAAAAAABhZM/B-dAinebT5o/s800/2008-08-16%2520-%252010%2520-%2520Overlord%2520Mtn.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\r\n&lt;div style=\"text-align:center\"&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Overlord Mtn&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\nSome more problems to deal with were where I would stay the next few days. All of the hostels in Vancouver were full for the weekend (doh!) but some persistent internet searching eventually turned up a vacancy in the Gastown district downtown. Also, tonight there would be no room available at the hostel, but M.C. was fine with me sleeping discretely behind the employee cabin in my bivvy sack as long as I didn&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;t get caught by the manager.\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\nM.C. was also very generous in giving me suggestions of what to do in town that wasn&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;t too taxing, since I wanted to get out but wasn&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;t sure how much I could do. He gave me some maps and said at the very least I should take the gondola to the summit of Whistler Mountain to hang around. The summit had excellent views of the area, including the peaks I had wanted to climb. I read up in some guidebooks at the hostel, M.C. lent me a trail map for the area, and I took off to salvage the day.\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\nThe ride into town as only 4 miles, but it felt much longer. I really hoped I recuperated soon, since I had 80 miles to cover the next day. Whistler was bustling with activity when I rode it. There was a BMX tournament going on and the area was packed with spectators and sponsors &amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#147; quite the zoo! I enjoyed watching some of the acrobatics before taking the gondola up.\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\nI really felt like I was cheating taking the gondola to a summit, and riding up in a crowded car with tourists really felt strange after hiking and cycling alone for the past few weeks. But I had no choice but to tolerate the crowds and enjoy the mountains in spite of them. One benefit of taking the gondola was that it gave great views of the Whistler ski resort. For summer the ski runs had been converted to mountain biking runs, with tight twisting tracks winding through the trees, and various obstacles set up for aerial tricks. Even the ski lifts had been modified to carry up mountain bikes! It was really entertaining watching the occasional mountain biking come flying out of the trees, take a jump, and then disappear back into the woods below.\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;div style=\"text-align:center\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-pOlE2_OaDjI/ULXHC_Q3T1I/AAAAAAABhZk/L7W81tUl_4Y/s2000/2008-08-16%2520-%252017%2520-%2520Whistler.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-pOlE2_OaDjI/ULXHC_Q3T1I/AAAAAAABhZk/L7W81tUl_4Y/s800/2008-08-16%2520-%252017%2520-%2520Whistler.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\r\n&lt;div style=\"text-align:center\"&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Whistler seen from Whistler Pk&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\nI arrived on the summit without any real plan of what to do. I figured I would just see what felt good. In a desire to escape the crowds, I hike hard and fast the remaining few hundred feet to the summit. As I had experience during my time in the Canadian Rockies, even though I was wasted for cycling, and in general physically I felt kind of &amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#152;blah&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;, my legs where plenty fresh and strong for hiking and scrambling. I lounged for a while on the summit enjoying the panoramic views, and then decided to take the most remote trail I could find to get away from the crowds.\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;The Musical Bumps Trail&lt;/b&gt;\r\n&lt;table style=\"text-align:center\"&gt;\r\n&lt;tbody&gt;\r\n&lt;tr&gt;\r\n&lt;td&gt;\r\n&lt;div style=\"text-align:center\"&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-YE35MFn-nYw/ULXHFzoWJ5I/AAAAAAABhZ8/9nOBuvk7siU/s2000/2008-08-16%2520-%252021%2520-%2520Mtn%2520Flowers.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-YE35MFn-nYw/ULXHFzoWJ5I/AAAAAAABhZ8/9nOBuvk7siU/s400/2008-08-16%2520-%252021%2520-%2520Mtn%2520Flowers.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;/div&gt;\r\n&lt;/td&gt;\r\n&lt;td&gt;\r\n&lt;div style=\"text-align:center\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-zH9hlBZUukM/ULXHIY0cBdI/AAAAAAABhaM/Q9J5FpX5Dg0/s2000/2008-08-16%2520-%252025%2520-%2520Trail%2520over%2520Cheakamus%2520Lake.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-zH9hlBZUukM/ULXHIY0cBdI/AAAAAAABhaM/Q9J5FpX5Dg0/s400/2008-08-16%2520-%252025%2520-%2520Trail%2520over%2520Cheakamus%2520Lake.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\r\n&lt;div style=\"text-align:center\"&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Musical Bumps trail traversing above Cheakammus Lake&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;/td&gt;\r\n&lt;/tr&gt;\r\n&lt;tr&gt;\r\n&lt;td&gt;\r\n&lt;div style=\"text-align:center\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-kT2CFstWCFM/ULXHEHwj8TI/AAAAAAABhZs/-1USXXrtc4g/s2000/2008-08-16%2520-%252019%2520-%2520Castle%2520Mtn.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-kT2CFstWCFM/ULXHEHwj8TI/AAAAAAABhZs/-1USXXrtc4g/s400/2008-08-16%2520-%252019%2520-%2520Castle%2520Mtn.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\r\n&lt;div style=\"text-align:center\"&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Castle Mountain&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;/td&gt;\r\n&lt;td&gt;\r\n&lt;div style=\"text-align:center\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-suRSCGvQMFg/ULXG68-IOLI/AAAAAAABhYk/-M9KFs8Lgxo/s2000/2008-08-16%2520-%252005%2520-%2520The%2520Black%2520Tusk.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-suRSCGvQMFg/ULXG68-IOLI/AAAAAAABhYk/-M9KFs8Lgxo/s400/2008-08-16%2520-%252005%2520-%2520The%2520Black%2520Tusk.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\r\n&lt;div style=\"text-align:center\"&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Black Tusk&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\r\n&lt;/td&gt;\r\n&lt;/tr&gt;\r\n&lt;/tbody&gt;\r\n&lt;/table&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;\r\nThe Whistler area felt like one gigantic amusement park, with disclaimers galore and everything nicely packaged for a controlled environment of fun - even the trails were well signed, and rated according to a color-coded difficulty scheme like ski runs. According to the map, I was taking the black line, which was an &amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#152;alpine&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#152; trail rated &amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#152;most difficult,&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153; like a black diamond ski run. I was used to such ratings for skiing as \r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;div style=\"text-align:center\"&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;/div&gt;\r\n&lt;div style=\"text-align:center\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-sCJ4pTEtKf8/ULXHBKV54OI/AAAAAAABhZU/flLBGDNpQeA/s2000/2008-08-16%2520-%252012%2520-%2520Castle%2520Mtn.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-sCJ4pTEtKf8/ULXHBKV54OI/AAAAAAABhZU/flLBGDNpQeA/s800/2008-08-16%2520-%252012%2520-%2520Castle%2520Mtn.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;\r\n&lt;div style=\"text-align:center\"&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Castle Mtn&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\r\n&lt;/b&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\nI grew up skiing in resorts, but seeing trails signed and mapped as such seemed very strange. I decided to link this trail with a route called &amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#156;Musical Bumps&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#157; that followed the network of trails over Piccolo and Flute Summit. Just as I had wanted, the trails on this route were just long and rugged enough to deter most of the tourists from coming this way. Soon I was in a more natural and serene environment again. The route was just perfect for my rest day. Not too hard, and surrounded by blooming wildflowers. The views south to rugged Mt Garabaldi, the Black Tusk, and Castle Mountain rising out of the glaciers were incredible. Cheakamus Lake spread out below, its colors a uniform and unreal sheen of deep blue-green. \r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;div style=\"text-align:center\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-MKwba-T6y9k/ULXHG2xqJlI/AAAAAAABhaE/lXKaq6v-IwM/s2000/2008-08-16%2520-%252024%2520-%2520Cheakamus%2520Lake.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-MKwba-T6y9k/ULXHG2xqJlI/AAAAAAABhaE/lXKaq6v-IwM/s800/2008-08-16%2520-%252024%2520-%2520Cheakamus%2520Lake.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;\r\n&lt;div style=\"text-align:center\"&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Cheakammus Lake&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\r\n&lt;/b&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\nBefore long I made it to Flute Summit, and then took loop back, this time following a network of trails on the east side of the ridge back to the gondola. I grabbed another full dinner in town, cycled back to the hostel just in time to catch the last of the alpenglow on Whistler Mountain fading away. I set up camp between the lake and employee cabins and went to sleep early, as I planned to sneak out early the next day.\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;div style=\"text-align:center\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-rjHK_7W6xoc/ULXHKG9ecgI/AAAAAAABhac/f3O0nddz6lQ/s2000/2008-08-16%2520-%252032%2520-%2520Whistler%2520Pk%2520at%2520Sunset.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-rjHK_7W6xoc/ULXHKG9ecgI/AAAAAAABhac/f3O0nddz6lQ/s800/2008-08-16%2520-%252032%2520-%2520Whistler%2520Pk%2520at%2520Sunset.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;\r\n&lt;div style=\"text-align:center\"&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Whistler Peak at sunset&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\r\n&lt;/b&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;a name=\"Day20\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\r\n&lt;h2&gt;\r\n&lt;a name=\"TOC-Day-20-Sea-to--Die-Highway---Whistler-to-Vancouver\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Day 20 &amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#147; Sea-to-&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#152;Die&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153; Highway - &lt;i&gt;Whistler to Vancouver&lt;/i&gt;\r\n&lt;/h2&gt;\r\n&lt;hr&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-h1c968cSAkI/ULXF_9N4RTI/AAAAAAABhQ4/wDcxh3QdTZk/s2000/10%2520-%2520Whistler-Vancouver%2520-%2520Route%2520Map.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-h1c968cSAkI/ULXF_9N4RTI/AAAAAAABhQ4/wDcxh3QdTZk/s800/10%2520-%2520Whistler-Vancouver%2520-%2520Route%2520Map.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-1Kr-SNSdqNc/ULXGAoSmXtI/AAAAAAABhRA/bT-CvbIIXR8/s2000/10%2520-%2520Whistler%2520to%2520Vancouver%2520Route%2520Profile.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-1Kr-SNSdqNc/ULXGAoSmXtI/AAAAAAABhRA/bT-CvbIIXR8/s800/10%2520-%2520Whistler%2520to%2520Vancouver%2520Route%2520Profile.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;u&gt;By Bike:&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/b&gt;\r\n&lt;ul&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;Distance: 82 miles\r\n&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;Elevation Gain: 4,830 ft\r\n&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;/ul&gt;\r\n\r\nToday I hoped to beat the approaching rainstorms and cycle the last leg of my cycling tour, from Whistler to Vancouver via the Sea-to-Sky Highway. In my direction, the highway descends 2,000 ft from Whistler through the mountains, reaching Squamish and the Pacific Ocean.&amp;Acirc;&amp;nbsp;\r\n&lt;div&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;div&gt;\r\n&lt;div style=\"text-align:center\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-QRigO2k1zws/ULXHcd875RI/AAAAAAABhc0/LTGSOsyaG6Q/s2000/2008-08-17%2520-%252032%2520-%2520Howe%2520Sound.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-QRigO2k1zws/ULXHcd875RI/AAAAAAABhc0/LTGSOsyaG6Q/s800/2008-08-17%2520-%252032%2520-%2520Howe%2520Sound.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\r\n&lt;div style=\"text-align:center\"&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Sea to Sky Highway seen from Horseshoe Bay&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\nFrom sea level, the highway straddles the steep mountainsides as it travels along the Howe Sound from Squamish to North Vancouver, crossing various seaside settlements along the way. Finally, the highway crosses the Lions Gate suspension bridge, passing through Stanley Park and right through downtown Vancouver. Today&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;s ride would take me from the mountains to the coast to a miniature Manhattan &amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#147; quite the variety for 80 miles!\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\nTo give a sense of how rugged the terrain is that the highway passes through, until the 1950s the coastal settlements were only accessibly via ferry. The highway didn&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;t reach Whistler until the 1960s, creating Whistler&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;s first physical link with the outside world. The cliffside above the how sound is steep and unstable enough that the road is regularly shut down from landslide damage. In fact, at the start of my trip a landslide had wiped out a stretch of the highway, which had since been rebuilt before I made it to Whistler.\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;div style=\"text-align:center\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-MIOhzMpkxnc/ULXHKzsv-9I/AAAAAAABhak/xXmm-nK0qCE/s2000/2008-08-17%2520-%252001%2520-%2520Morning%2520on%2520Alta%2520Lake.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-MIOhzMpkxnc/ULXHKzsv-9I/AAAAAAABhak/xXmm-nK0qCE/s800/2008-08-17%2520-%252001%2520-%2520Morning%2520on%2520Alta%2520Lake.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\r\n&lt;div style=\"text-align:center\"&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Alta Lake&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\nI woke in time to watch the sun rise of the still waters of Alta Lake, and then quietly gathered my gear that was stored inside the hostel and was on the road by 7am. Although I was still really sore and tired from the previous day&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;s wear and tear, once I got moving on my bicycle I gradually loosened up, feeling better as I moved on. There was a light rain falling as I left Whistler, which cleared up as I lost elevation. \r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;div style=\"text-align:center\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-bsHu1wn1wo8/ULXHNVQ47pI/AAAAAAABha8/ZZf60ZybGUc/s2000/2008-08-17%2520-%252004%2520-%2520Coastal%2520Range.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-bsHu1wn1wo8/ULXHNVQ47pI/AAAAAAABha8/ZZf60ZybGUc/s800/2008-08-17%2520-%252004%2520-%2520Coastal%2520Range.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\r\n&lt;div style=\"text-align:center\"&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Coastal Range West of Whistler&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\nAbout halfway to Squamish I hit road construction. Although it was slightly more stressful, the traffic along the highway was never '),(21,151,'/mountaineering/trip-reports/canada/cycling-and-scrambling-from-calgary-to-vancouver/epilogue','Epilogue','Epilogue','Trip_Report','content: &lt;div dir=\"ltr\"&gt;\r\n&lt;h1&gt;\r\n&lt;a name=\"TOC-Epilogue\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Epilogue&lt;/h1&gt;\r\n\r\nSo in the end, despite the mishaps along the way and nixing some plans at the end, my trip was a resounding success. My idea of combing climbing with cycling worked perfectly, and I found that it is entirely feasible to alternate cycling days with climbing days, one being a rest from the other. I also got to experience the joy of climbing peaks completely by manpower alone, including the approach! \r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\nExperiencing the countryside is quite a different experience at 10-15 mph then in a car. You have a much fuller experience of the terrain you pass through. For example, I had no idea how smelly the highway gets from diesel or that logging trucks are nature&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;s air freshener, spreading pine freshness wherever they go. And as it was my first cycling tour, I learned a lot along the way as far as how to do things better next time, because there definitely will be a next time. One thing to count on is Murphey&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;s Law &amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#147; I cycled over 700 miles and never got a single flat, yet I had several major breakdowns despite a pre-trip checkup that would have been impossible to fix on the road.\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\nI made it to Vancouver the day before the rains started, but rain didn&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;t stop me from getting out and enjoying the city. It is an excellent city to spend a rainy day in, especially Stanley Park. The pain in my right leg finally eased up and didn&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;t slow down my wandering at all, although the numbness in my hands lasted another 6 weeks (I&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;ve always had this problem riding, which has since gone away, I think through better riding form).\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\nI also had one last little adventure in town as I arranged departure plans of taking a Greyhound to Seattle to see a friend before jetting down to L.A. for a job interview and back to Berkeley to begin my last semester of graduate school coursework. I needed to get another bike box to pack my bicycle in for transport on the bus (and shipping in Seattle), so I biked with my loaded touring rig to a bike shop in Yale Town to pick one up. The problem was the bus station was several miles away next to China Town. \r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\nNow, how to get my loaded bicycle and the bike box over there? I lashed the 3.5\'X4.5&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;X1&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153; cardboard box diagonally across my back with used bicycle tire tubes and cycled along False Creek. Quite the sight since the box looked larger than I was. As I pulled in to the bus station, by bike fully loaded, with the huge box slung across my back, I rode up to a guy waiting out front. Feeling playful, I happily proclaimed: &amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#156;See, you really can take everything with you!&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#157;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a

Canada. While the emphasis was to be on the Bugaboos, the bad weather forecast for the area got us to decide to take a longer approach and swing by the classic Mt Gimli, in the Valhalla Range of British Columbia. The South Ridge was a super alpine classic that is well known in Canada, but we were fortunate to have it to ourselves. Originally rated III, 5.8, many guidebooks have increased the rating to 5.10 for the big roof crux. However, I still feel like the route is 5.9- or 5.9+ at the most generous, with the real crux being on P1! The campsite is beautiful, and while a car-to-car is easy to do, I highly recommend spending a night up there! The mountain goats are VERY friendly, too.&amp;Acirc;&amp;nbsp;\r\n\r\n&lt;hr&gt;\r\n&lt;hr&gt;\r\n&lt;h2&gt;\r\n&lt;a name=\"TOC-July-27-2013---The-Approach\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;July 27, 2013 - The Approach&lt;/h2&gt;\r\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;span style=\"border-collapse:collapse\"&gt;As the dust settled and we emerged from our transport vessel, curious natives approached us one by one, to greet us and inquire as to how we could have made it here in one piece. With the looks we got, and the repetitious approach, license plate inspection, greet, and inquiry that each hiker did, one at a time during the hour we spent packing, I felt a bit as if we were aliens who had just arrived from outer space.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\r\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;span style=\"border-collapse:collapse\"&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\r\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;span style=\"border-collapse:collapse\"&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-jQNQV0F83mI/Uhbpr9bdP-I/AAAAAAACfBs/PV9-obZAtNU/s1600/2013-07-26%2520-%2520003%2520-%2520Gimli%2520-%2520IMG_1898.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-jQNQV0F83mI/Uhbpr9bdP-I/AAAAAAACfBs/PV9-obZAtNU/s800/2013-07-26%2520-%2520003%2520-%2520Gimli%2520-%2520IMG_1898.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Signs of travel.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&amp;Acirc;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\r\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;span style=\"border-collapse:collapse\"&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\r\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;span style=\"border-collapse:collapse\"&gt;&amp;Acirc;&amp;nbsp;Of course we weren\'t. Just two Utahns eager to climb. The poor weather forecast for the Bugaboos got me and Alec to change our plans, and stop by Gimli Peak in the Valhalla Range on our way to our main objective on our long trip out from Salt Lake City. The final drive was reputed to be a rough dirt road, that was maybe passable in a Subaru. We didn\'t have a Subaru, nor 4WD, but no one said that was required. However, due to cut funding for Provincial Parks in British Columbia, the road has gotten into much worse shape since the travel information had been written. Fortunately, we were driving Alec\'s car, and he has had some wild times driving it through a lot of rugged desert country. We nearly bottomed out twice, but barely made it to the trailhead thanks to Alec\'s bold and skillful driving. Everyone else at the trailhead was in a truck, SUV, or some other high clearance or 4WD vehicle, so naturally they ventured over to investigate this unexpected vehicle and where it was from!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\r\n&lt;div&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-IeJ2B5t3wuM/Uhbtjaq8pWI/AAAAAAACfCE/CP3nef325UE/s1600/2013-07-27%252520-%252520005%252520-%252520Gimli%252520-%252520IMG_1902.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-IeJ2B5t3wuM/Uhbtjaq8pWI/AAAAAAACfCE/CP3nef325UE/s800/2013-07-27%252520-%252520005%252520-%252520Gimli%252520-%252520IMG_1902.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;The three summit of Mt Prestley towering above the dirt road on the way to Gimli. The dirt road is fine here but gets very bad near the end.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\nThe trailhead was surprisingly crowded for such an out-of-the way place, with German tourists, a large group of French Canadians from Quebec, and a variety of other travelers. Fortunately most of the crowd was either coming out, or only doing the class 3 scramble up Gimli. There was one other party vying for our route, but in the end they joined their friends on the class 3 and we had this classic line all to ourselves!&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-mixWfg7gGAc/Uhbty9ZMeaI/AAAAAAACfCY/yU3XJEILWdg/s1600/2013-07-27%252520-%252520006%252520-%252520Gimli%252520-%252520IMG_1906.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-mixWfg7gGAc/Uhbty9ZMeaI/AAAAAAACfCY/yU3XJEILWdg/s800/2013-07-27%252520-%252520006%252520-%252520Gimli%252520-%252520IMG_1906.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Alec and his car ready to go. The wire mesh is to keep rubber-eating porcupines from getting in and eating the tires! I think our mesh extends high enough to keep bears out, too. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;div&gt;I was attracted to this route after first seeing &lt;a href=\"http://www.stephabegg.com/home/tripreports/britishcolumbia/gimli\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;Steph Abegg\'s TR on her website&lt;/a&gt;, and later seeing &lt;a href=\"http://www.ericandlucie.com/Gimli/Gimli.htm\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;Eric &amp;amp; Lucie\'s account on their website&lt;/a&gt;. Its inclusion in lists such as &lt;a href=\"http://lamountaineers.org/NAC/browserf/other/climlist/clindex.htm\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;North American Classic Climbs&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Beckeys-Favorite-North-American-Climbs/dp/0980122716/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;amp;ie=UTF8&amp;amp;qid=1376800047&amp;amp;sr=1-1&amp;amp;keywords=fred+beckey%27s+100+favorite+north+american+climbs\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;Fred Beckey\'s 100 Favorite North American Climbs&lt;/a&gt; further reinforced for me the idea that this place was well worth visiting, even though it was out of the way of most other international climbing destinations in BC, and few other climbing friends of mine had heard of it (Alec included). I am very glad that we made this detour! The scenery was beautiful, the campsite was wonderful, mountain goats plentiful and friendly, and the climbing was excellent. Although it can be climbed car-to-car reasonable enough, the bivy at the base is so nice that I\'d say it would be a shame to do it this way unless you are pressed for time. There is even a toilet and food storage lockers, so there is no need to worry about packing in or out extra gear like a bear canister or wag bags. We hiked in the evening we arrived, then did the climb, descended, and drove to Revelstoke the following day.&lt;/div&gt;\r\n&lt;div&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;/div&gt;\r\n&lt;div&gt;The South Ridge was originally rated 5.8, but has since been re-rated in some sources to 5.10, with the big roof seeming to be the most commonly considered crux of the route. I felt like a section on P1 was harder, and the topo in Beckey\'s book shows this lower crux at a comparable rating. The lower crux was more committing and physical, but straightforward on the moves, while the upper crux is intimidating and requires some thinking, but it can be well protected and is only a couple of moves, although height can play a big role in how hard those moves are. Still, compared to climbs I have done in Yosemite, the High Sierra, and Southern Utah, I\'d say 5.10 is a generous rating for the route. It really is more like 5.9- to 5.9+, so solid 5.9 leaders shouldn\'t be discouraged from getting on this one.&lt;/div&gt;\r\n&lt;div&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;/div&gt;\r\n&lt;div&gt;The route itself is surprisingly steep for being mostly 5.7, and it is like this due to all of the horizontal dike bands. It reminds me of an alpine version of some of the climbing classics at Lover\'s Leap.&lt;/div&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-bgQo7L1NkvQ/Uhbt0k9JMbI/AAAAAAACfCg/_drPlwkmF8o/s1600/2013-07-27%252520-%252520007%252520-%252520Gimli%252520-%252520IMG_1905.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-bgQo7L1NkvQ/Uhbt0k9JMbI/AAAAAAACfCg/_drPlwkmF8o/s800/2013-07-27%252520-%252520007%252520-%252520Gimli%252520-%252520IMG_1905.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Gimli Peak seen from the trailhead.

The terrain was just right for making the pace and exertion like that of a good aerobic workout, similar to some of the bike rides I like to do.&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-csqnVkird44/Uhbt9fYay_I/AAAAAAACfDQ/4d2a8neIQ9Y/s1600/2013-07-27%252520-%252520010%252520-%252520Gimli%252520-%252520IMG_1909.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-csqnVkird44/Uhbt9fYay_I/AAAAAAACfDQ/4d2a8neIQ9Y/s800/2013-07-27%252520-%252520010%252520-%252520Gimli%252520-%252520IMG_1909.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Nearing the campsites.

After being denied Bugaboo Spire &lt;a href=\"http://www.markpthomas.com/mountaineering/trip-reports/canada/crescent-tower-lion-s-way\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;the day prior&lt;/a&gt; from weather that was much different than forecast, Alec and I moved camp back down to the Kain Hut to regain morale. The forecast for Aug 3 was again 40% chance of thunderstorms, and it looked the same or worse for the next week, so this was our last chance to climb the NE Ridge of Bugaboo Spire before returning home.&amp;Acirc;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;span style=\"background-color:transparent;line-height:1.25;font-size:10pt\"&gt;Another alpine start left us at the base of the route just before sunrise, with clear skies and nice alpenglow. The dirty chute we took to the col was the crux climbing of the day, and we belayed one pitch. The route was fun and went quickly, taking us 5 hrs to climb the 10 official pitches. We chose to climb the north summit rather than take the bypass that most people do, and then descended the Kain Route, running into Allister, the hut caretaker, again! (We had run into him on the rainy day climb of &lt;a href=\"http://www.markpthomas.com/mountaineering/trip-reports/canada/crescent-tower-lion-s-way\"&gt;Lion\'s Way&lt;/a&gt; the day before). The weather looked threatening for a while when we were high on the spire, but ultimately the skies cleared up into a fine day for the descent back to the hut &amp;amp; car . . . rain and lightning started once we started driving out from the Bugs . . .&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\r\n&lt;div&gt;\r\n&lt;div&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;/div&gt;\r\n&lt;div&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;/div&gt;\r\n&lt;div&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-NjfB56fpF6M/UndODI3qiiI/AAAAAAAC1Sk/-_oEUD-yImc/s1600/2013-08-03%2520-%2520013%2520-%2520Bugaboo%2520Spire%2520NE%2520Ridge%2520-%2520IMG_2325%2520-%2520annotated%2520close.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-NjfB56fpF6M/UndODI3qiiI/AAAAAAAC1Sk/-_oEUD-yImc/s800/2013-08-03%2520-%2520013%2520-%2520Bugaboo%2520Spire%2520NE%2520Ridge%2520-%2520IMG_2325%2520-%2520annotated%2520close.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Bugaboo Spire and its spectacular NE Ridge seen from the col.

Starting during the earliest glow of daylight, it was hard to see the chutes too distinctly, besides them looking mostly improbably, but possibly class 4 with some spooky sections. There were two options we could see, but as the snow had refrozen and we had left our crampons at camp, we opted for the chute with the lower entry. I suspect this was not the way to go.

The crux is only a move or two until you get your feet over the little roof, and then it is very easy. However, I think I went off route higher up and made it more like 5.8+ to 5.9 as our topo made it look like I stayed in the crack system all the way to the ledges above. This way leads one through progressively thinning finger cracks with liebacking and stemming, and at the thinnest part, one must then traverse on thin 5.6-5.7 face moves to the right of the crack and up a body length above thin gear before reaching a rest stance! I believe one should actually climb the 5.6 chimney to the side of this and traverse over if they wanted to take the \'proper way\'.&amp;Acirc;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;\r\n&lt;div&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;/div&gt;\r\n&lt;div&gt;Although apart from shrinking my ego a bit by getting worked more than expected on the pitch, my variation was plenty good to do.&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-P3csNNcPpTU/Uht6ig6CwlI/AAAAAAACeWg/cF8deA4CRYA/s1600/2013-08-03%252520-%252520017%252520-%252520Bugaboo%252520Spire%252520NE%252520Ridge%252520-%252520IMG_2329.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-P3csNNcPpTU/Uht6ig6CwlI/AAAAAAACeWg/cF8deA4CRYA/s800/2013-08-03%252520-%252520017%252520-%252520Bugaboo%252520Spire%252520NE%252520Ridge%252520-%252520IMG_2329.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Looking down from the top of the first pitch.

Normally I am one to prefer chimneys, but the topo and other beta indicated that they would be easy and unmemorable. I came across a photo on SummitPost of some climbers doing a \'5.9\' crack to the side, and this had me sold on the idea! This was one of the best pitches of the route, although not as hard as advertised if you only stay on the line for the first pitch. If done this way, you have a little more than half a pitch of 5.7 thin-solid hands on fun double cracks and then a single crack.

It was like endless cl. 4 mantels in a wide slot. The remaining 5.7 crux is burly, but short. Unfortunately, for how our belays worked out, I ran out of rope&amp;Acirc;&amp;nbsp;just barely&amp;Acirc;&amp;nbsp;past the crux, so I had to endure an awkward hanging belay in the shade. Once you reach the final large ledge before the headwall that you pass on the right for the 5.7 section, I recommend you belay there in the sun if there is any doubt of making it back to the ridge crest!&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-NW71e91s2-Y/Uht8WcUu7iI/AAAAAAACelQ/RDlMfFGYp0I/s1600/2013-08-03%252520-%252520047%252520-%252520Bugaboo%252520Spire%252520NE%252520Ridge%252520-%252520IMG_2362.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-NW71e91s2-Y/Uht8WcUu7iI/AAAAAAACelQ/RDlMfFGYp0I/s800/2013-08-03%252520-%252520047%252520-%252520Bugaboo%252520Spire%252520NE%252520Ridge%252520-%252520IMG_2362.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Following Alec as we simul-climbed the remainder of the route (cl. 4-5). P9-P10&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\nBefore we knew it, we were atop the route, and had the reportedly long traverse of the spire ridge ahead of us before we could begin descending. Clouds were starting to build, and Alec was getting a bit nervous, but I couldn\'t resist tagging the summit if we were so close! Things still looked OK anyways.&lt;/div&gt;\r\n&lt;div&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;/div&gt;\r\n&lt;div&gt;I think the topos are wrong on the next part, though, if you are doing anything more than traversing to the descent route.&amp;Acirc;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;\r\n&lt;div&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;/div&gt;\r\n&lt;div&gt;First, the closer highpoint you come to is NOT the north summit. We climbed atop it, and it was obviously shorter than a summit farther along the ridge. I kept climbing back up to the ridge crest, and it seemed quite obvious to me that the northern high point is just barely across a gap from the south summit, and NOT on the northern edge of the spire ridge.&lt;/div&gt;\r\n&lt;div&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;/div&gt;\r\n&lt;div&gt;Second, topos showed that to climb the north summit, instead of doing the short rappel to the cl. 4-5 ledge system that cuts across the eastern side of the spire, one should wrap around to the western side of the spire. DO NOT do this. This way is needlessly more difficult, doesn\'t take you anywhere that you can\'t reach from the \'bypass route\', and it is far less secure. Being on the windward side and rarely climbed, this whole section was covered in wet moss &amp;amp; lichen.&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-Tf95qCvW9t8/Uht8aDu726I/AAAAAAACelo/zGTlX4ahM7U/s1600/2013-08-03%252520-%252520048%252520-%252520Bugaboo%252520Spire%252520NE%252520Ridge%252520-%252520IMG_2363.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-Tf95qCvW9t8/Uht8aDu726I/AAAAAAACelo/zGTlX4ahM7U/s800/2013-08-03%252520-%252520048%252520-%252520Bugaboo%252520Spire%252520NE%252520Ridge%252520-%252520IMG_2363.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Looking back on the wet mossy and gritty terrain as we traversed to the summit on the west side of the summit ridge.

It paled in comparison to the quality of the NE Ridge, but the position, exposure, and solid rock made it a fine alpine ridge scramble. Also, after experience many ridge traverses in the Sierra, I\'d say there is nothing special about this traverse being long or tricky, as far as ridge traverses go. The descent, however, is quite complex, and would be very difficult in the dark or bad weather if you hadn\'t climbed the Kain Route before. We hadn\'t, but we had good conditions by which to navigate, as well a the steady stream of climbers ascending that route.&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;h2&gt;\r\n&lt;a name=\"TOC-Descent-down-the-South-Ridge-Kain-Route-\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Descent down the South Ridge (Kain Route)&lt;/h2&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-MpN8PjAyG-0/Undbswa-VYI/AAAAAAAC1S8/EdMGy9GfbIE/s1600/2013-07-30%2520-%2520053%2520-%2520Pigeon%2520Tower%2520-%2520IMG_2106%2520-%2520annotated.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-MpN8PjAyG-0/Undbswa-VYI/AAAAAAAC1S8/EdMGy9GfbIE/s800/2013-07-30%2520-%2520053%2520-%2520Pigeon%2520Tower%2520-%2520IMG_2106%2520-%2520annotated.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&amp;Acirc;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Bugaboo Spire\'s South Ridge (Kain Route) seen from the West Ridge of Pigeon Spire. (July 30, 2013)&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;&amp;Acirc;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\nFred Beckey lists this route as one of his \'100 Favorite\' climbs, and I would agree that it deserves more attention, and it gets far more trash talk of loose rock than it deserves. The lower section that is cl. 2 does have looser rock, but it is nothing bad compared to most alpine terrain out there. As you get higher on the ridge, the rock improves, and the spectacular views continue to get better and better. The upper third of the route is spectacularly exposed, which can be belayed or short-roped for comfort, but it is easy enough to do as a frightfully exposed scramble on solid rock. Some of the knife edges are incredibly narrow. The final crux roped pitch over the The Gendarme looks really fun as well. The color and texture of the rock on this other section was truly unique and memorable as well, and I liked it far more than the upper section of the NE Ridge.&lt;/div&gt;\r\n&lt;div&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;/div&gt;\r\n&lt;div&gt;In a nutshell, the Kain Route is more of a highly exposed scrambling route with a few pitches of roped climbing at the top, rather than a sustained technical rock climb like the NE Ridge. However, this makes it a good introductory climb to the range, good to do to be familiar with the descent, and as the commitment only grows gradually as you get higher, it is a good climb to do on an unstable weather day.&amp;Acirc;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;\r\n&lt;div&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;/div&gt;\r\n&lt;div&gt;Unfortunately, we used the rappels rather than downclimbing the entire route, so I can\'t consider myself having properly climbed the route. Next time I go back to the Bugs, I\'ll have this one short-listed to do as a second priority climb!&amp;Acirc;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-7x-rIgBwFAA/Uht9LJILfTI/AAAAAAACesQ/CCDXIMNxsbA/s1600/2013-08-03%252520-%252520060b%252520-%252520Bugaboo%252520Spire%252520NE%252520Ridge%252520-%252520IMG_0405%252520-%252520Alec.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-7x-rIgBwFAA/Uht9LJILfTI/AAAAAAACesQ/CCDXIMNxsbA/s800/2013-08-03%252520-%252520060b%252520-%252520Bugaboo%252520Spire%252520NE%252520Ridge%252520-%252520IMG_0405%252520-%252520Alec.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Me at the base of the first rappel down from the V-Notch.

The&amp;Acirc;&amp;nbsp;the famous Beckey-Chouinard Route on South Howser Tower (V, 5.10, 19 pitches)&amp;Acirc;&amp;nbsp;was our main objective, and while ideally we woud have warmed up on something easier like Bugaboo Spire, we had a perfect multi-day weather window that we couldn\'t afford to miss.&amp;Acirc;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;\r\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\r\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;span style=\"border-collapse:collapse\"&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\r\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;span style=\"border-collapse:collapse\"&gt;We stopped and stayed at the hut the first day hiking in, as a heavy rain and sleet storm began just as we reached the Kain Hut. The second day we set up camp at Applebee Campground and traveled over to climb the classic &lt;a href=\"http://www.markpthomas.com/mountaineering/trip-reports/canada/pigeon-spire-w-ridge\"&gt;West Ridge of Pigeon Spire&lt;/a&gt; on our way to setting up our bivy near South Howser Tower. We decided to bivy rather than a camp-to-camp push as Alec was wary of how much energy he\'d have for such a long push, and I was wary of how well my damaged knee could take such a large day (this year I have found that breaking up approaches &amp;amp; climbs helps a lot).&amp;Acirc;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\r\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;span style=\"border-collapse:collapse\"&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\r\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;span style=\"border-collapse:collapse\"&gt;It took us about 2-3 hrs to descend to the toe of the ridge&amp;Acirc;&amp;nbsp;and scramble the first 1,000 ft to the base of the first roped pitch. From there we had many pitches of climbing consistently at 5.8-5.9! The only other people we saw were a guide and client who passed us, but otherwise we had this spectacular route to ourselves on this fine sunny day. It took us 12:45 hrs from the first roped pitch to the summit. We summitted with just enough time to do the 10 rappels for the descent before dark over 2:25 hrs, and reached our bivy just before we needed to turn on our headlamps. 19 hrs of fun!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\r\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;span style=\"border-collapse:collapse\"&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\r\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;span style=\"border-collapse:collapse\"&gt;The timing was perfect as that night it rained on us, and the weather stayed off &amp;amp; on rainy for the next few days.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\r\n&lt;div&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;/div&gt;\r\n&lt;div&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-io9YIcY0xJM/UnXs9W71i6I/AAAAAAAC1Rk/pTF_N-P-5lg/s1600/IMG_4484%2520-%2520annotated.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-io9YIcY0xJM/UnXs9W71i6I/AAAAAAAC1Rk/pTF_N-P-5lg/s800/IMG_4484%2520-%2520annotated.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Annotation of the route on an aerial photo taken by Steph Abegg on a flight with John Scurlock on September 24, 2011&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-MlwbNxDRUUM/UnXtE-AlL7I/AAAAAAAC1Rs/amT7KGqaSig/s1600/IMG_4595%2520-%2520annotated.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-MlwbNxDRUUM/UnXtE-AlL7I/AAAAAAAC1Rs/amT7KGqaSig/s800/IMG_4595%2520-%2520annotated.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Annotation of the route on an aerial photo taken by Steph Abegg on a flight with John Scurlock on September 24, 2011&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;&amp;Acirc;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-MwTDhR-bOj8/Ul9Od6YZS6I/AAAAAAACz6M/vU2K1lDX-I0/s1600/Bugaboos%2520Region%2520ZOOM%252020%2520-%2520Maps%2520Howser.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-MwTDhR-bOj8/Ul9Od6YZS6I/AAAAAAACz6M/vU2K1lDX-I0/s800/Bugaboos%2520Region%2520ZOOM%252020%2520-%2520Maps%2520Howser.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Map of the Howser Towers and areas accessed from Bugaboo-Snowpatch Col&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;&amp;Acirc;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\nThis is a big route and requires an early start. We left our bivy at about 3:30am. In the dark we had to be careful to descend into East Creek through the right chute, and scramble up at the right spot to gain the ridge, but it all fell together easily enough with careful routefinding. We downclimbed some loose cl. 2-3 boulders from the col, then down a 25-30 degree snow slope for a short bit before things leveled off. Then it was mostly a gradual downhill stroll until we could identify a slope leading up to the ridge crest. From here the scrambling was mostly cl. 2 with occasional cl. 3 bits through large boulders, with maybe one cl. 4-5 part (I was lazy with routefinding). Our timing was just about perfect as we got to the base of the route at first light. By the time we were roped up and ready to go, the rock was barely warm enough for reasonably comfortable climbing.&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-ynVGsV4NQU8/Uht5YYqp1jI/AAAAAAACeLw/B49HjmubO9A/s1600/2013-07-31%252520-%252520005%252520-%252520Beckey-Chouinard%252520-%252520IMG_2144.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-ynVGsV4NQU8/Uht5YYqp1jI/AAAAAAACeLw/B49HjmubO9A/s800/2013-07-31%252520-%252520005%252520-%252520Beckey-Chouinard%252520-%252520IMG_2144.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Alec ready to climb the B-C!&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-H27FRiLV1w8/Uht5mgIVjGI/AAAAAAACeNw/LaUy4pOfMXo/s1600/2013-07-31%252520-%252520009%252520-%252520Beckey-Chouinard%252520-%252520IMG_2149.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-H27FRiLV1w8/Uht5mgIVjGI/AAAAAAACeNw/LaUy4pOfMXo/s800/2013-07-31%252520-%252520009%252520-%252520Beckey-Chouinard%252520-%252520IMG_2149.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&amp;Acirc;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Sunrise at last illuminating peaks to the SW.

I recommend simul-climbing the first two pitches.

We were surprised, as we never saw their lights following us on the glacier, and we thought we were moving very fast. Oddly, the leader only had a small daypack on, smaller than either of our packs, and the follower wasn\'t carrying anything! Because of this, and the extreme efficiency of the leader in setting up anchors and belaying, we assumed it must be a guide and client, which proved to be the case.&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-1V2vgkCjDWM/Uht6Yp4xURI/AAAAAAACeVI/smoXRu_V1js/s1600/2013-07-31%252520-%252520017%252520-%252520Beckey-Chouinard%252520-%252520IMG_2158.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-1V2vgkCjDWM/Uht6Yp4xURI/AAAAAAACeVI/smoXRu_V1js/s800/2013-07-31%252520-%252520017%252520-%252520Beckey-Chouinard%252520-%252520IMG_2158.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Following up P5 (5.8).

I was looking forward to climbing without that bulky pack, and I was even more eager to climb the Great Dihedral! It looks so nice and lived up to its reputation as a fantastic series of sustained pitches. Getting into it was a tad tricky, with a number of ways to go on broken terrain below. Then I climbed a thin crack before traversing right on a slab to gain the corner. I think Alec ended P5 a bit short, which left me at a small but OK alternate belay shortly above where I gained the corner in the dihedral.&amp;Acirc;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-AlNkj_w9giU/Uht6dlvbmEI/AAAAAAACeVw/SnXBP6l0jl0/s1600/2013-07-31%252520-%252520018%252520-%252520Beckey-Chouinard%252520-%252520IMG_2161.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-AlNkj_w9giU/Uht6dlvbmEI/AAAAAAACeVw/SnXBP6l0jl0/s800/2013-07-31%252520-%252520018%252520-%252520Beckey-Chouinard%252520-%252520IMG_2161.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Leading P6, climbing a little 5.7 tier to enter the Great Dihedral.

I led nearly the entire thing as one long pitch. Lots of leapfrogging cams! Especially #3 C4s. It reminded me of an easier version of Mithral Dihedral.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\nIn an attempt to get the dihedral done in as few pitches as possible, I mostly climbed out the full 60m available to us, rather than stopping at the alcove belay. The alcove belay is VERY comfy, BTW, and while doable, my partially hanging belay just beneath the final lieback was awkward. The alcove belay is just beyond the large roofs in the photo above.&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-GgQ-ZIHSP-s/Uht6mIoW_cI/AAAAAAACeXA/cD3wnQ_gMyc/s1600/2013-07-31%252520-%252520020%252520-%252520Beckey-Chouinard%252520-%252520IMG_2163.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-GgQ-ZIHSP-s/Uht6mIoW_cI/AAAAAAACeXA/cD3wnQ_gMyc/s800/2013-07-31%252520-%252520020%252520-%252520Beckey-Chouinard%252520-%252520IMG_2163.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Beginning the first real pitch of the Great Dihedral.

What also kept it interesting wast that one was constantly surmounting little steps and roofs, with easier terrain in between where rests could be had. Because the crack was so consistently at a #2-#3 camalot size, I did a lot of leapfrogging as I went to keep it chill without running out of gear.&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-5-6I6N30CBM/Uht6qbL4F9I/AAAAAAACeXg/9_mGUMzmPQY/s1600/2013-07-31%252520-%252520021%252520-%252520Beckey-Chouinard%252520-%252520IMG_2164.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-5-6I6N30CBM/Uht6qbL4F9I/AAAAAAACeXg/9_mGUMzmPQY/s800/2013-07-31%252520-%252520021%252520-%252520Beckey-Chouinard%252520-%252520IMG_2164.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Never ending corner on the Great Dihedral.

I found it very easy, while the upper 5.8 OW and chimney pitches seemed MUCH harder.&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-W20xkmo8cls/Uht7odGnTuI/AAAAAAACeek/VcfCgu3-Hi8/s1600/2013-07-31%252520-%252520030%252520-%252520Beckey-Chouinard%252520-%252520IMG_2175.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-W20xkmo8cls/Uht7odGnTuI/AAAAAAACeek/VcfCgu3-Hi8/s800/2013-07-31%252520-%252520030%252520-%252520Beckey-Chouinard%252520-%252520IMG_2175.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;The second part of P11.

I\'m still not sure how one should climb in to it. There are two options, both of which require climbing a ways off of the belay without any pro:&amp;Acirc;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;\r\n&lt;div&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;/div&gt;\r\n&lt;div&gt;(1) Climb up to the first ledge above the belay (5.7?) and do a long traverse on a ledge to the right, where the wide crack from below continues. Plug in a #4 Camalot, plug in a leg, and resume climbing up!&lt;/div&gt;\r\n&lt;div&gt;(2) Climb higher, to the second ledge, and traverse a thinner sloping friction ledge into the chimney system about 8-10 ft higher, before first pro. This option was probably easier, technically, but seriously runout!&lt;/div&gt;\r\n&lt;div&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;/div&gt;\r\n&lt;div&gt;I took option 1 and found it to be the crux of the wide on the route. #4 camalot forever, in an irregular crack, so I had to take it out for each movement. Rests were tough, and I couldn\'t quite plug myself all the way in, but it was also hard to unplug myself with finesse. Very strange, awkward, and tiring climbing. I was very happy once I reached the chimney were I could rest and leave some pro behind me!&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-09N_RXG1OXY/Uht8DuF6ixI/AAAAAAACeig/t7eMmerZiME/s1600/2013-07-31%252520-%252520036%252520-%252520Beckey-Chouinard%252520-%252520IMG_2181.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-09N_RXG1OXY/Uht8DuF6ixI/AAAAAAACeig/t7eMmerZiME/s800/2013-07-31%252520-%252520036%252520-%252520Beckey-Chouinard%252520-%252520IMG_2181.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Looking down after the first OW (P12).

It reminded me of P2 on Reed\'s Direct in that it has a lean to it, and you are climbing a bunch of half-diamond-shaped holes. Except on this one, the holes were large enough to slot a leg into, and the pinches were too narrow to slide the leg through, so I had to do a lot of coming out, sliding in, coming out, over and over to move up. I also had to take the #4 camalot out for each resetting. Eventually the hairline crack on my left opened up for an occasional thin nut or C3 to leave as a backup! Sometimes I could stem it or some face features, especially higher up where I was getting tired and needed more of a break from the wide crack.&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\nThis long endurance-fest ends with another tricky roof-chimney combo, and then a very nice belay ledge in the sun.&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-HKslSz9Z7q8/Uht8WEu-6rI/AAAAAAACelI/j22bweegJT4/s1600/2013-07-31%252520-%252520040%252520-%252520Beckey-Chouinard%252520-%252520IMG_2185.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-HKslSz9Z7q8/Uht8WEu-6rI/AAAAAAACelI/j22bweegJT4/s800/2013-07-31%252520-%252520040%252520-%252520Beckey-Chouinard%252520-%252520IMG_2185.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Looking up P15-P16 This was a nice break from all of the tough wide below!

Could I be off route. Looking to my left, things looked familiar, and I realized that I was already at the 5.10 face traverse! It turns out the topo we had been using had assumed climbers would be breaking up the wide pitches into shorter ones, and by still doing close to 60m pitches, I had inadvertently linked a number of them. Unfortunately that meant that I led some of the pitches that were to be Alec\'s. Sorry!&lt;/div&gt;\r\n&lt;div&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;/div&gt;\r\n&lt;div&gt;This final crux section involves either a C0 tension traverse with a 5.9 move to turn the corner, or a thin face traverse, once again with the crux being turning the corner, at 5.10a/5.10+/whatever. Some people thought this part was easy, and each topo had a different rating. I\'d call it more towards 5.10+, but then again, I suck at face climbing. While the pitons seemed pretty good, this traverse is still a bit dicey as the leader would take a large pendulum back into the corner if they fell at the crux, which is a ways out. It isn\'t so bad for the follower if the leader takes car to flip the rope and not place pro for a while on the easier terrain in the gully.&amp;Acirc;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-hnxzuA6b0vg/Uht8qnujYEI/AAAAAAACen8/RrpMd64_Egc/s1600/2013-07-31%252520-%252520046%252520-%252520Beckey-Chouinard%252520-%252520IMG_2193.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-hnxzuA6b0vg/Uht8qnujYEI/AAAAAAACen8/RrpMd64_Egc/s800/2013-07-31%252520-%252520046%252520-%252520Beckey-Chouinard%252520-%252520IMG_2193.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Alec traversing out on the crux 5.10 face traverse of P18.

I was so tired that I didn\'t even close up my bivy sack, and I slept right through the rain that ended our first weather window for climbing in the Bugaboos . . .&lt;/div&gt;\r\n&lt;div&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-DOQAxuZ8gkw/UnXs0gWAmxI/AAAAAAAC1RU/vEycA_l7YM0/s1600/Bugaboos_S_20120515_039%2520-%2520annotated%2520close.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-DOQAxuZ8gkw/UnXs0gWAmxI/AAAAAAAC1RU/vEycA_l7YM0/s800/Bugaboos_S_20120515_039%2520-%2520annotated%2520close.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&amp;Acirc;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Annotation of the route on an aerial photo taken by Steph Abegg on a flight with John Scurlock on May 15, 2012&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-jmW-OvLzlpU/UnXs4aRxsmI/AAAAAAAC1Rc/L9HWK6Fw-MM/s1600/Bugaboos_S_20120515_039%2520-%2520annotated%2520full.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-jmW-OvLzlpU/UnXs4aRxsmI/AAAAAAAC1Rc/L9HWK6Fw-MM/s800/Bugaboos_S_20120515_039%2520-%2520annotated%2520full.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&amp;Acirc;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Annotation of the route on an aerial photo taken by Steph Abegg on a flight with John Scurlock on May 15, 2012&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;hr&gt;\r\n&lt;hr&gt;\r\n&lt;h2&gt;\r\n&lt;a name=\"TOC-1\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;/h2&gt;\r\n&lt;h2&gt;\r\n&lt;a name=\"TOC-Links:\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Links:&lt;/h2&gt;\r\n&lt;ul&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://picasaweb.google.com/105894936663116565516/20130731BugaboosSHowserTowerViaBeckeyChouinardWAlecLaLonde?authuser=0&amp;amp;feat=directlink\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;Picasa Album&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://www.supertopo.com/tr/South-Howser-Tower-Beckey-Chouinard/t12222n.html\"&gt;SuperTopo TR&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;/ul&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;h2&gt;\r\n&lt;a name=\"TOC-Rack:\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Rack:&lt;/h2&gt;\r\n&lt;ul&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;2 x 0.4\"-3\" (#0 C3 to #3 C4)&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;1 x #4 C4&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;12-14 alpine slings&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;/ul&gt;\r\n&lt;h2&gt;\r\n&lt;a name=\"TOC-Notes:\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Notes:&lt;/h2&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;u&gt;Bivying:&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/b&gt;\r\n&lt;/div&gt;\r\n&lt;div&gt;Bivying near Howser is in the gray area of being OK by the provincial parks, so check with the Kain Hut attendant to be up to date on what locations, if any, are considered OK, and in what manner. It has been banned outright off and on in the past.&lt;/div&gt;\r\n&lt;div&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;/div&gt;\r\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;u&gt;Pack Strategy:&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\r\n&lt;div&gt;This is an important and tricky thing to work out, as the route is so long, and has a lot of wide, that carrying packs is difficult. However, because it is so long and exposed, with need to travel on glaciate terrain and to be prepared for wind and potential bad weather, it is risky to travel too light as well. See the Glacier Travel logistics for what we chose to do with that extra gear.&lt;/div&gt;\r\n&lt;div&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;/div&gt;\r\n&lt;div&gt;For us, what we tried and seemed to work well was bringing 2 packs: a moderate-sized camelback for the leader, and a larger pack (compressed Andanista Wild Things) for the follower. The leader carried a 3-liter camelback, a light jacket, and a small amount of food. The follower carried 1-2 liters of water to refill, both pair of boots, the glacier travel gear, and the bulkier jackets, in addition to some of the day\'s food, follower\'s light jacket, and first aid kit.&lt;/div&gt;\r\n&lt;div&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;/div&gt;\r\n&lt;div&gt;Alec only needed to trail the pack for a couple of sections on the wide climbing above the big sandy ledge, and no hauling was needed. As a follower, he was able to stay farther out and stem more on the wide sections. I was able to wear the follower pack on all of the pitches that I followed, with the toughest parts being pulling the 5.9+ lower roof crux, and the 5.10 face traverse near the end.&lt;/div&gt;\r\n&lt;div&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;/div&gt;\r\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;u&gt;Approach/Descent Glacier Travel Logistics:&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\r\n&lt;div&gt;The descent to the base of the route is more serious than the glacier walk-off after the climb. We didn\'t find the routefindig hard or crevasses worrisome - in the conditions of the terrain (well-trodden path) and snow (not quite freezing) that we traveled in, we could have gotten by leaving our crampons behind and traveling unroped as we never traveled near any crevasses, and the angles rarely got all that steep (note, that nighttime freezing or lack of a path would have made crampons much more useful). Having one ax for the follower might be a good idea for insurance, though.&lt;/div&gt;\r\n&lt;div&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;/div&gt;\r\n&lt;div&gt;With our 60m doubles, we could easily reach completely flat snow on the last rappel, and you could get pretty close even with a single 60m. There is nothing nearby to slide into if you had to slide the last little bit. From there it is an easy, low-angle walk back to the col. There are a couple of small crevasses that are easy to avoid with proper routefinding, and it was no worse than the walk in from Applebee campground.&lt;/div&gt;\r\n&lt;div&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;/div&gt;\r\n&lt;div&gt;So in short, for our conditions, bringing 1 pair of crampons and 2 axes was overkill. We could have done just fine with one axe.&lt;/div&gt;\r\n&lt;div&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;span style=\"border-collapse:collapse\"&gt;\r\n&lt;table border=\"1\" bordercolor=\"#888\" cellspacing=\"0\" style=\"border-collapse:collapse;border-color:rgb(136,136,136);border-width:1px\"&gt;\r\n&lt;tbody&gt;\r\n&lt;tr&gt;\r\n&lt;td&gt;&amp;Acirc;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/td&gt;\r\n&lt;td&gt;&amp;Acirc;&amp;nbsp;Time (of day)&lt;/td&gt;\r\n&lt;td&gt;&amp;Acirc;&amp;nbsp;Time (length)&lt;/td&gt;\r\n&lt;td&gt;&amp;Acirc;&amp;nbsp;Notes&amp;Acirc;&amp;nbsp; &amp;Acirc;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/td&gt;\r\n&lt;td&gt;&amp;Acirc;&amp;nbsp;Leader&lt;/td&gt;\r\n&lt;td&gt;&amp;Acirc;&amp;nbsp;Rating&lt;/td&gt;\r\n&lt;/tr&gt;\r\n&lt;tr&gt;\r\n&lt;td style=\"width:119px;height:30px\"&gt;&amp;Acirc;&amp;nbsp;Left Pigeon Spire Col&lt;/td&gt;\r\n&lt;td style=\"width:142px;height:30px\"&gt;&amp;Acirc;&amp;nbsp;3:30 am&lt;/td&gt;\r\n&lt;td style=\"width:60px\"&gt;&amp;Acirc;&amp;nbsp;2:20 hrs&lt;/td&gt;\r\n&lt;td style=\"width:165px;height:30px\"&gt;&amp;Acirc;&amp;nbsp;Approach &amp;amp; P1 scramble. cl. 2-3 easy boulders.&lt;/td&gt;\r\n&lt;td style=\"width:83px;height:30px\"&gt;&amp;Acirc;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/td&gt;\r\n&lt;td style=\"width:94px;height:30px\"&gt;&amp;Acirc;&amp;nbsp;Easy Glacier&lt;/td&gt;\r\n&lt;/tr&gt;\r\n&lt;tr&gt;\r\n&lt;td style=\"width:119px;height:30px\"&gt;&amp;Acirc;&amp;nbsp;Base of P2&lt;/td&gt;\r\n&lt;td style=\"width:142px;height:30px\"&gt;&amp;Acirc;&amp;nbsp;5:50 am&lt;/td&gt;\r\n&lt;td style=\"width:60px\"&gt;&amp;Acirc;&amp;nbsp;30 min&lt;/td&gt;\r\n&lt;td style=\"width:165px;height:30px\"&gt;&amp;Acirc;&amp;nbsp;Bathroom break.

According to Ed Hartouni\'s quote from the Roper Guide, it is an acronym that stands for \"Right Of Reed Pinnacle\". The route caught my eye one day while browsing the Reid guide. According to the topo, 6 moderate pitches of mostly crack climbing would take one up the center of the cliff, just short of the top, making the route one of the longest at Reed Pinnacle. \r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\nVenturing up this route, I wasn\'t disappointed. Although it was a little dirty, the route offers burly, old-school 5.7 chimney and offwidth climbing that is probably more appropriate for 5.8 leaders accustomed to wide techniques. The views are nice, and the final pitch was great (left variation) - I\'d say 4-5 stars on the Taco rating. Overall I\'d give the route 3 stars.\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\nI first attempted to climb the route in January, choosing to try out the first 3 pitches of Flatus as a more direct start instead of climbing the easier and dirtier first 2 pitches of the standard route. This start was a great route - clean rock with sustained and burly 5.9 climbing and interesting moves. The route also lived up to its name, as each pitch seemed capable of making a climber blow out some &lt;a href=\"http://www.thefreedictionary.com/flatus\"&gt;flatus&lt;/a&gt;.\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\nUnfortunately my partner was new to wide climbing, and was utterly spent after the 3 pitches. \r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-kJ9Vbqz3lPQ/TxpnIUwJ_oI/AAAAAAAA7FM/Aq9xCHbLdSE/s2000/2012-01-15%2520-%252021%2520-%2520Flatus%2520-%2520Hubert%2520Finishing%2520P3.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-kJ9Vbqz3lPQ/TxpnIUwJ_oI/AAAAAAAA7FM/Aq9xCHbLdSE/s600/2012-01-15%2520-%252021%2520-%2520Flatus%2520-%2520Hubert%2520Finishing%2520P3.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Hubert escaping the 5.7 chimney on P3 of Flatus&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\nI returned another weekend with my friend Jared Wood, a partner more accustomed to wide climbing.

It is harder than it looks. Instead, take the dirt and root-filled corner to your right. No pro is available, but the climbing is easy enough. The crux of this pitch was keeping dirt out of my eyes. \r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-n1Yz79fIJFM/Ty_tkcnoSVI/AAAAAAAA8JY/aaAbgmOEasU/s2000/2012-02-04%2520-%252007%2520-%2520The%2520Rorp%2520-%2520P1%2520Decision%2520Go%2520Right.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-n1Yz79fIJFM/Ty_tkcnoSVI/AAAAAAAA8JY/aaAbgmOEasU/s600/2012-02-04%2520-%252007%2520-%2520The%2520Rorp%2520-%2520P1%2520Decision%2520Go%2520Right.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\nThe topo indicates belaying above the corner, but if you\'re careful with drag, you can link both pitches. At the very least I recommend continuing up the gully to the right to the sling anchors atop P2 of Stone Groove for a sunnier belay with better views. Don\'t take the more inviting cracks to the left or directly above unless you want to go off  route.\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-Cws9gSkeurA/TxpnE8DpZuI/AAAAAAAA7AI/dpcJvIEnJGc/s2000/2012-01-15%2520-%252012%2520-%2520Flatus%2520-%2520P1%25262%2520of%2520the%2520Rorp.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-Cws9gSkeurA/TxpnE8DpZuI/AAAAAAAA7AI/dpcJvIEnJGc/s600/2012-01-15%2520-%252012%2520-%2520Flatus%2520-%2520P1%25262%2520of%2520the%2520Rorp.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Gully on P2.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\n\r\nI had to stop at the top of P2 of Stone Groove as I had left my #5 C4 with Jared and it was obvious that I would need it to protect the next section.\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-GNb_dtCn5sE/Ty_tlhWp_gI/AAAAAAAA8JY/3CkIVfxVwYg/s2000/2012-02-04%2520-%252009%2520-%2520The%2520Rorp%2520-%2520P2%2520OW.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-GNb_dtCn5sE/Ty_tlhWp_gI/AAAAAAAA8JY/3CkIVfxVwYg/s600/2012-02-04%2520-%252009%2520-%2520The%2520Rorp%2520-%2520P2%2520OW.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;h2&gt;\r\n&lt;a name=\"TOC-Pitch-2-5.5-\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Pitch 2 (5.5?)&lt;/h2&gt;\r\nI actually thought this was one of the harder pitches of the climb, even though the topo only showed it as a 5.5 crack.

I placed a #4 to start and stemmed the lower section. I climbed the upper part as an off-width, arm-barring and stacking hands as I pumped up with my feet and leapfrogged my #5 with me. Since I had 2 #5s, I left one, which made the pro pretty chill. Keep in mind that if you only bring one, the pitch might feel a little runout, and it will be one of only 3 pieces placed (1 #4, 1 #5, and 1 #2 to protect the exit). There are some nice rapp bolts to belay from at the top.\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-lQqMROFeivA/TxpnKoc0-eI/AAAAAAAA7B0/jvlWGhMVwuw/s2000/2012-01-15%2520-%252026%2520-%2520P2%2520of%2520The%2520Rorp.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-lQqMROFeivA/TxpnKoc0-eI/AAAAAAAA7B0/jvlWGhMVwuw/s600/2012-01-15%2520-%252026%2520-%2520P2%2520of%2520The%2520Rorp.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Upper part of P2 seen while rappelling on an earlier foray up to the big ledge.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;h2&gt;\r\n&lt;a name=\"TOC-Pitch-3-5.6-\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Pitch 3 (5.6)&lt;/h2&gt;\r\nPitch 3 is where the route really begins.

To skip P1 and P2 Climb the first 3 short pitches of Flatus (excellent 5.9). Apparently there is a 5.8 bolted face variation that bypasses the P3 5.7 chimney, but I found the chimney pretty funand secure (1 piece of pro in crack near chockstones). You still have to walk a little bit to get to the P3 start, which is accessed by walking right and then back left up a cl. 3 step with a fixed line.\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-Nvl3ed43iqg/Txpm-l3LaII/AAAAAAAA6-o/01smPLsBQl0/s2000/2012-01-15%2520-%252001%2520-%2520Flatus%2520-%2520P1.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-Nvl3ed43iqg/Txpm-l3LaII/AAAAAAAA6-o/01smPLsBQl0/s600/2012-01-15%2520-%252001%2520-%2520Flatus%2520-%2520P1.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Pitch 1 (5.9 for direct-left variation)&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-9nCr63PDi8M/TxpnBPYyY9I/AAAAAAAA6_I/nYEzgOoApcg/s2000/2012-01-15%2520-%252005%2520-%2520Flatus%2520-%2520P2%2520%2526%2520Hubert.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-9nCr63PDi8M/TxpnBPYyY9I/AAAAAAAA6_I/nYEzgOoApcg/s600/2012-01-15%2520-%252005%2520-%2520Flatus%2520-%2520P2%2520%2526%2520Hubert.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Pitch 2 (5.9 route crux)&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-OautMfXWDoM/TxpnFcAVD-I/AAAAAAAA7AM/B6X9sIbM1Xw/s2000/2012-01-15%2520-%252013%2520-%2520Flatus%2520-%2520P3%25205_7%2520chimney.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-OautMfXWDoM/TxpnFcAVD-I/AAAAAAAA7AM/B6X9sIbM1Xw/s600/2012-01-15%2520-%252013%2520-%2520Flatus%2520-%2520P3%25205_7%2520chimney.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Pitch 3 (5.7)&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\n2.

I pulled my small fleece blanket a little higher on me and readjusted my head on the reclined drivers seat. I had made an 8hr drive from Salt Lake City, UT to Aspen, CO by myself in order to meet up with some other SPers from across the intermountain west to climb Capitol Peak, reportedly one of Colorado&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;s most difficult 14ers based on the class 4 rating of its knife-edge ridge.

Having just come from Boulder, Colorado, he had told me how similar the two ridges were.  When I saw Scott Patterson&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;s call for partners, I jumped at the chance to climb the peak. The message board thread had received a lot of interest, and ultimately, we had a posse composed of yours truly from Salt Lake City, UT, Scott Patterson from Craig, CO, Brad Snider from Aurora, CO, Casey McCoy from Albuquerque, NM, Joel Schenk from Minnesota, and Kevin Donovan from Fort Worth, TX &amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#147; truly a diverse group from all over the intermountain west.  \r\n&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;\r\nI had arrived in Aspen the night before and failed to make contact with Joel and Casey, with whom I had hoped to share a campsite, so I drove around for a while before wandering my way out to the trailhead and going to sleep ca. 3am. Someone else was already camping at the trailhead, and I assumed that the person in the tent must be someone from our group. Finally my watch alarm went off at 6am &amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#147; time to get up and head into town to meet the others. But this mysterious tent wasn&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;t stirring, and I was curious as to who it could be. I went back to sleep, waiting for them to get up first.  \r\n&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;\r\nFinally I saw some signs of life and walked over to check it out &amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#147; it was Casey. Apparently he had the same idea I did for free camping. We admired the gorgeous view we had of Capitol Peak, far up the canyon, and headed down to Old Snowmass to meet the others.  \r\n&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;table&gt;\r\n&lt;tbody&gt;\r\n&lt;tr&gt;\r\n&lt;td&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-MIro0JraPqg/TjD-ULau_kI/AAAAAAAAhDI/YqLitXs5Azo/s2000/5-21-05-1%2520Capitol%2520Creek%2520TH.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-MIro0JraPqg/TjD-ULau_kI/AAAAAAAAhDI/YqLitXs5Azo/s240/5-21-05-1%2520Capitol%2520Creek%2520TH.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Capitol Pk seen from the trailhead.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;/td&gt;\r\n&lt;td&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-LFjeosPM-uc/TjD-kYgGYjI/AAAAAAAAhD0/P4hv2BDTW2A/s2000/5-21-05-12%2520Motherload%2520Cornice.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-LFjeosPM-uc/TjD-kYgGYjI/AAAAAAAAhD0/P4hv2BDTW2A/s240/5-21-05-12%2520Motherload%2520Cornice.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;The mother of all cornices&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;/td&gt;\r\n&lt;td&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-vpjX_yDSI2U/TjD-lxn2mhI/AAAAAAAAhD4/PtS2fjqB_DA/s2000/5-21-05-13%2520Pt%252012%252C754.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-vpjX_yDSI2U/TjD-lxn2mhI/AAAAAAAAhD4/PtS2fjqB_DA/s240/5-21-05-13%2520Pt%252012%252C754.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Pt. 12754\'&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;/td&gt;\r\n&lt;/tr&gt;\r\n&lt;/tbody&gt;\r\n&lt;/table&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;\r\nShortly after 7am we pulled up to Harleywood Caf&amp;Atilde;&amp;copy;. We were the last to arrive, and after some brief introductions and breakfast, I offered to lead the others to the trailhead. Joel was riding a motorcycle and said he would head up before us, and then hitch a ride where the road got rough. After the convoy finally got moving, I noticed that Joel had been a bit slower to get out, and was actually bringing up the rear! After several horribly dusty miles we reached a pullout where he left his ride.  \r\n&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;\r\nWe headed out from the trailhead following the irrigation ditch approach variation. Granted its longer, but the other way lost 400 ft. Although it was shown as mostly a cross-country route in Gerry Roach&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;s &amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#156;Colorado&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;s Fourteeners&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#157; guidebook, this way actually had a fairly distinct trail that took us high on the bench overlooking Capitol Creek.  The pace of the group was slow and easy, as we had all day to reach camp at Capitol Lake. Still, my hyperactive urgings wouldn&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;t go away, and as soon as Kevin suggested I bring up the lead, I was off. I kept trying to slow down, and stopped often, but I was still often far ahead of the group. Finally, I began to feel guilty about my anti-social behavior, and insisted on following someone else for the remainder of the approach as a method of restraint.  \r\n&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;table&gt;\r\n&lt;tbody&gt;\r\n&lt;tr&gt;\r\n&lt;td&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-meiCsJ-Dj3s/TjD-tJyF1GI/AAAAAAAAhEI/c96KSxzqzUY/s2000/5-21-05-15%2520Capitol%2520Pk%2520%2526%2520Pt%252012%252C754.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-meiCsJ-Dj3s/TjD-tJyF1GI/AAAAAAAAhEI/c96KSxzqzUY/s240/5-21-05-15%2520Capitol%2520Pk%2520%2526%2520Pt%252012%252C754.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Capitol Pk &amp;amp; Pt. 12,754\'&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;/td&gt;\r\n&lt;td&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-oRJkNurmCrA/TjD-ZwVFBnI/AAAAAAAAhDY/lg_KJ5T2M-w/s2000/5-21-05-5%2520Capitol%2520Pk%2520%2526%25201st%2520Headwall.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-oRJkNurmCrA/TjD-ZwVFBnI/AAAAAAAAhDY/lg_KJ5T2M-w/s240/5-21-05-5%2520Capitol%2520Pk%2520%2526%25201st%2520Headwall.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Approaching Capitol Pk&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;/td&gt;\r\n&lt;td&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-xK2-oZ5qB7M/TjD-nG4XP3I/AAAAAAAAhD8/Mf4H93hoVh0/s2000/5-21-05-14%2520Capitol%2520Pk%2520%2526%2520East%2520Ridge%2520-%2520Label.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-xK2-oZ5qB7M/TjD-nG4XP3I/AAAAAAAAhD8/Mf4H93hoVh0/s240/5-21-05-14%2520Capitol%2520Pk%2520%2526%2520East%2520Ridge%2520-%2520Label.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;K2 &amp;amp; Capitol Pk&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;/td&gt;\r\n&lt;/tr&gt;\r\n&lt;/tbody&gt;\r\n&lt;/table&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;\r\nFinally the trail dropped down to a meadow to rejoin the main trail. After a precarious but non-eventful log crossing over the overflowing stream, we continued on our way. At about 9,300 ft there was enough snow that we donned our snowshoes and picked our way through the open forest. By this time Brad was mostly leading, and as he hiked faster than everyone else, I ended up hiking ahead with him. Pulling out my pocket topo map for reference, I kept us along the edge of the tree line below Mt Daley to avoid any unnecessary elevation loss. Occasionally we had glimpses of the 13er above, and the craggy spires on its lower slopes made for some interesting scenery.  \r\n&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;\r\n  At one point we reached a large clearing that allowed us to see Capitol Pk and the craggy summits on the west side of the canyon &amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#147; they were incredible! While we had suffered some rain and snow earlier, blue sky was coming out again, so while the others hiked ahead, Joel and I got out our cameras. One feature that got everyone&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;s attention was a massive cornice spanning the col between pt. 12,878 and another rise &amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#147; from our distance the thing was just enormous! It must have been some quarter-mile long and over 40 feet thick.  \r\n&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;table&gt;\r\n&lt;tbody&gt;\r\n&lt;tr&gt;\r\n&lt;td&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-mVMTY6NwHro/TjD-zTS3ZXI/AAAAAAAAhEY/rr1_xfP25Aw/s2000/5-21-05-19%2520Mt%2520Daley.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-mVMTY6NwHro/TjD-zTS3ZXI/AAAAAAAAhEY/rr1_xfP25Aw/s240/5-21-05-19%2520Mt%2520Daley.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Approaching below Mt Daly&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;/td&gt;\r\n&lt;td&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-ugFodd_dPLw/TjD-3wUqkZI/AAAAAAAAhEk/uNlG1SqN85I/s2000/5-21-05-22%2520Stud%2520Shot%2520-%2520KevinDovan-ScottPatterson-JoelSchenk.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-ugFodd_dPLw/TjD-3wUqkZI/AAAAAAAAhEk/uNlG1SqN85I/s240/5-21-05-22%2520Stud%2520Shot%2520-%2520KevinDovan-ScottPatterson-JoelSchenk.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;The team at camp.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;/td&gt;\r\n&lt;td&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-sRE68zZhXcs/UOEwqZjaU8I/AAAAAAABneI/sfPZUswj4Sc/s2000/107642.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-sRE68zZhXcs/UOEwqZjaU8I/AAAAAAABneI/sfPZUswj4Sc/s240/107642.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;The team at camp.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;/td&gt;\r\n&lt;/tr&gt;\r\n&lt;/tbody&gt;\r\n&lt;/table&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;\r\nAs we neared the first main headwall, we crossed a huge avalanche debris field. The blocks of snow were so large that it was like scrambling over talus &amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#147; the scene almost appearing like our party was crossing a miniature icefall. Beyond this was a steep 200 ft wall of snow that we had to climb. By the time I reached it Kevin and Casey were halfway up, but had stopped. Once I caught up to them I discovered that they had lost the lower part of a pole in the snow. After waiting a few minutes, I kick-stepped around them and finished breaking trail to the top.   \r\n&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;table&gt;\r\n&lt;tbody&gt;\r\n&lt;tr&gt;\r\n&lt;td&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-0vxWYlZPmk8/TjD_Bv4ipzI/AAAAAAAAhE8/HFGUaBKrywc/s2000/5-21-05-26%2520Capitol%2520Relief%2520-%2520Labels.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-0vxWYlZPmk8/TjD_Bv4ipzI/AAAAAAAAhE8/HFGUaBKrywc/s240/5-21-05-26%2520Capitol%2520Relief%2520-%2520Labels.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Various routes on Capitol Peak&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;/td&gt;\r\n&lt;td&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-EBBs47wk9gQ/TjD-_0Y3lJI/AAAAAAAAhE0/1fKtvNnOXU4/s2000/5-21-05-25%2520K2%2520%2526%2520East%2520Ridge.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-EBBs47wk9gQ/TjD-_0Y3lJI/AAAAAAAAhE0/1fKtvNnOXU4/s240/5-21-05-25%2520K2%2520%2526%2520East%2520Ridge.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;K2 &amp;amp; the East Ridge (cl.4)&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;/td&gt;\r\n&lt;td&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-O3U45LJCPLg/TjD_IE9PcdI/AAAAAAAAhFQ/wIcz1ss_1oM/s2000/5-21-05-30%2520Sunset%2520Pt%252012%252C754.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-O3U45LJCPLg/TjD_IE9PcdI/AAAAAAAAhFQ/wIcz1ss_1oM/s240/5-21-05-30%2520Sunset%2520Pt%252012%252C754.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Pt. 12,754\' seen from camp&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;/td&gt;\r\n&lt;/tr&gt;\r\n&lt;/tbody&gt;\r\n&lt;/table&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;\r\nThe snow was steep, perhaps reaching 45&lt;sup&gt;o&lt;/sup&gt; near the top, and it was just solid enough that an ice axe would have been nice, but the distance was short and soon I was on top.   After another break we continued across another picturesque clearing, up another easier headwall to the left of a rounded knoll, and soon we were at Capitol Lake. Scott picked out a spot to bivi out in the open on some bare boulders while the rest of us dug out our tent platforms. The ancient moraine holding back Capitol Lake provided a nice windbreak for the camp, while still allowing us a front-seat view of the massive north face of Capitol Peak as the sun set &amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#147; truly one of the best campsites I&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;ve had in the mountains.  \r\n&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;\r\nThat night I realized that I hadn&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;t brought enough fuel, and my stove kicked out early. As the lake was still frozen over, this left us with a possible fuel shortage for melting enough water to comfortable stay here until Monday, so we began discussing heading out the next day after summitting.  \r\n&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;\r\n&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-70vJR3sCwxw/TjD_EsgkL9I/AAAAAAAAhFE/qVEBE1aIDaA/s2000/5-21-05-27%2520Capitol%2520Sunset.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-70vJR3sCwxw/TjD_EsgkL9I/AAAAAAAAhFE/qVEBE1aIDaA/s800/5-21-05-27%2520Capitol%2520Sunset.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;h2&gt;\r\n&lt;a name=\"TOC-Alpine-Start\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Alpine Start&lt;/h2&gt;\r\n&lt;h2&gt;\r\n&lt;a name=\"TOC-Sunday-May-29th\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Sunday, May 29th&lt;/h2&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;\r\nAt 4am I was out of my bivi sack and rearing to get moving. Headlamps on, packs on, crampons on &amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#147; we were ready to go. The temperatures had gotten below freezing the night before, so the snow was just hard enough for some quality cramponing.   \r\n&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;\r\n&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-AM7ASCrbWGc/TjD_MN5PNdI/AAAAAAAAhFg/vwanAI3eDnk/s2000/5-22-05-34%2520Sunrise%2520on%2520K2%2520Ridge.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-AM7ASCrbWGc/TjD_MN5PNdI/AAAAAAAAhFg/vwanAI3eDnk/s800/5-22-05-34%2520Sunrise%2520on%2520K2%2520Ridge.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Sunrise on K2\'s East Ridge&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;\r\nThe game plan was to head up the 900 ft east-facing slope above camp to the K2-Daley saddle, reaching it just at sunrise, ca. 5:30am. From there we would drop down toward Moon Lake and meet up with the Snowmass approach route, which would put us on to K2, a high point at the end of Capitol&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;s NE ridge, by circling around to the east. From there we would climb the NE ridge, and possibly set up a fixed line over the knife-edge if things looked too dicey with the snow cover.  \r\n&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;\r\nAs expected, the slope was nice and hard, and we made fast progress. I worked on my pacing, and managed to hike non-stop until the top (apart from a quick stop for a photo). There I found a nice windbreak in the rocks and enjoyed the sunrise as the others caught up, Casey about 5 minutes behind and the others another 15 minutes later.  \r\n&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;\r\n&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-HlxT30MIR90/UOH8ycmKv_I/AAAAAAABnf4/_ad9d7YGq3I/s2000/108595.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-HlxT30MIR90/UOH8ycmKv_I/AAAAAAABnf4/_ad9d7YGq3I/s500/108595.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Joel climbing above camp&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/--EB9G-fAxrg/TjD_OvXHYPI/AAAAAAAAhFo/xwg1i6gYHPY/s2000/5-22-05-36%2520Traversing%2520%2526%2520Mt%2520Daley.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/--EB9G-fAxrg/TjD_OvXHYPI/AAAAAAAAhFo/xwg1i6gYHPY/s500/5-22-05-36%2520Traversing%2520%2526%2520Mt%2520Daley.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;The SP crew traversing the slopes below K2&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;\r\nFrom the saddle we could look up the class 4 approach variation, which heads up the north ridge of K2. I had wanted to climb up via this variation and then descend the easier one, but so far the others were dubious about taking a more difficult variation to the top. From the saddle it looked slower than the easier traverse, so off we went.  \r\n&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;\r\nThe snow was steep where we traversed around. While the normal route follows a trail down into the cirque before re-ascending, Scott didn\'t want to lose the elevation, so we were traversing high. I was concerned about this as we would be more likely to be cliffed out by following so close to the base of the cliffs composing K2&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;s north ridge. Also, the terrain was steeper, and traversing steep slopes is a pain. As I continued to break trail, the slope got steeper (perhaps around 35&lt;sup&gt;o&lt;/sup&gt;), and over the next rise I could see some rocks. From this distance I couldn&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;t tell if we could make it through them, but things didn&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;t look good.  \r\n&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;\r\nLooking up the slope I saw a break in the rocks &amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#147; an easy way to gain the class 4 ridge? I shouted my concerns to the others, and mentioned that the class 4 ridge looked pretty doable from where I was. I didn&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;t want to lead everyone up there without some discussion, and after Scott and Casey agreed to check it out, I started up.     \r\n&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;\r\n&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;h2&gt;\r\n&lt;a name=\"TOC-Wombat-Direct\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Wombat Direct&lt;/h2&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;\r\nA body-width moat had formed around the base of the rocks, so I crossed on a snow bridge and kick-stepped up the slope. The incline increased to about 45&lt;sup&gt;o&lt;/sup&gt;-50&lt;sup&gt;o&lt;/sup&gt;, and the snow still had a good hard layer on top, although at first I accidentally kicked through this to more unstable snow. Once I reached the rocks I could see that although the scrambling would be steep, it would be up a series of reasonably large ledges.  I hooked a rock with my axe, carefully stepped across snow by the rock, and started scrambling.  The others seemed to be enjoying the excitement of this detour as well, and Kevin declared this route the &amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#152;Wombat Direct&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;.  \r\n&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;table&gt;\r\n&lt;tbody&gt;\r\n&lt;tr&gt;\r\n&lt;td&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-KtxmJbDi1sM/TjD_QE7MaeI/AAAAAAAAhFs/s0l9L7NTVPo/s2000/5-22-05-37%2520Looking%2520Down%2520Wombat%2520Direct.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-KtxmJbDi1sM/TjD_QE7MaeI/AAAAAAAAhFs/s0l9L7NTVPo/s240/5-22-05-37%2520Looking%2520Down%2520Wombat%2520Direct.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Looking down the \'Wombat Direct\'&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;/td&gt;\r\n&lt;td&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-rn-8KLc4bYs/TjD_R3j84dI/AAAAAAAAhFw/66VTdV54UhE/s2000/5-22-05-38%2520Mt%2520Daley%2520from%252012%252C800ft.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-rn-8KLc4bYs/TjD_R3j84dI/AAAAAAAAhFw/66VTdV54UhE/s240/5-22-05-38%2520Mt%2520Daley%2520from%252012%252C800ft.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Mt Daly&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;/td&gt;\r\n&lt;td&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-EuCGAQfF554/TjD_TpG44LI/AAAAAAAAhF0/8RsAf_B6TSU/s2000/5-22-05-39%2520Casey%2520on%2520K2%2520Ridge.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-EuCGAQfF554/TjD_TpG44LI/AAAAAAAAhF0/8RsAf_B6TSU/s240/5-22-05-39%2520Casey%2520on%2520K2%2520Ridge.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;On the ridge&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;/td&gt;\r\n&lt;/tr&gt;\r\n&lt;/tbody&gt;\r\n&lt;/table&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-J-o3puizZN4/TjD_U85cA6I/AAAAAAAAhF4/MU1ZvsNRbo0/s2000/5-22-05-40%2520Final%2520Wall.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-J-o3puizZN4/TjD_U85cA6I/AAAAAAAAhF4/MU1ZvsNRbo0/s240/5-22-05-40%2520Final%2520Wall.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;The final headwall&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;\r\nWhile the axe and crampons made things a little awkward, the climbing was still plenty easy, although I began to find the occasional loose rock. I warned the others and led the way to the ridge crest, where I stowed my crampons and axe. As I enjoyed a snack break, Casey and Kevin scouted a little further ahead and shouted back that the route wasn&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;t doable. All they could see was 5th class terrain with lethal exposure along a pinnacle-lined ridge. I was rather surprised as I knew that we were on route according to Roach&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;s guide, and my impression was that CO 4th class tended to be easier than the CA 4th class to which I was accustomed.  \r\n&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;\r\nI scrambled up the ridge to have a look, and it didn&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;t look good. The ridge narrowed, dropped off, and arose as several pinnacles. Rocky ribs stuck out from the ridge, and it looked like they might drop off on the backside. The limit of my view was blocked by a large headwall that looked quite formidable. This just didn&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;t seem right, so while Casey scrambled a little further along the ridge to make his final evaluation, I looked around for an easier way &amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#147; bingo. There was a break in the rock rib, so I walked along some class 2 talus, that just happened to be leveled about the width of a sidewalk. At the opening I could see down a moderate class 3 chimney that was some 7 feet high, and then a large class 2 bowl that could be used to easily bypass the pinnacles. This was definitely the way. Still, I wasn&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;t sure about the next headwall. I could pick out possible routes, but the steepness of the rock would dictate whether it was class 4 or 5. I would need to get closer. \r\n&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;\r\nFurther reconnaissance would take more time, and we had already spent a good deal of time getting up the ridge, so I shouted my discoveries back to the others to see what they thought. It was a no go. They didn&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;t feel comfortable with the loose rock and exposure, and were worried about the extra time it could take. Kevin was a little P.O&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;d about why we had come up this way, as it was obviously not the main route (oops! I guess I hadn&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;t expressed my intentions clearly enough when leading!).  Since not everyone was used to loose rock, or scrambling with such exposure, I agreed that it would be safest to just reverse course and continue with our earlier traversing.   \r\n&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;\r\nBy the time we made it back to the snow we had spent almost 2 hrs on the ridge. Clearly this group was too large and inexperienced for the conditions of the ridge, so in retrospect Kevin&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;s desire to backtrack was a good idea &amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#147; even though I found a doable route, we would have continued to climb slower than I would have expected, and we might have come to another impasse where someone would have felt too uncomfortable to continue on.    \r\n&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;h2&gt;\r\n&lt;a name=\"TOC-Turning-Back\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Turning Back&lt;/h2&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;\r\nI continued to break trail, but by now the snow had noticeably softened. I was now sinking up to my ankles in wet snow. A few minutes later I heard that Casey and Joel had turned around.  This was unfortunate, but I still felt like we could make the summit &amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#147; it was still only about 8am. About 5 minutes later Kevin shouted out misgivings about our pressing on, so we stopped to discuss the situation.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-6PxRrPyR_D8/UOH_bHBClYI/AAAAAAABnhA/1HCVwY4oej8/s2000/107432.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-6PxRrPyR_D8/UOH_bHBClYI/AAAAAAABnhA/1HCVwY4oej8/s800/107432.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;At our high point before turning back&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;\r\nKevin had several concerns. One was that we had lost a lot of time on the K2 ridge. Another was that the snow had softened much more than expected. This meant that if we pressed on, then by the time we came back this way, the snow would be so soft that walking would be miserable (the others were already having a hard time with footing in the loose snow, although I hadn&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;t). I said that I was more than ready to suffer through this to reach the summit, as long as others were still willing to do the same, but I didn&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;t want to pressure anyone into continuing on if they didn&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;t want to.   \r\n&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;\r\nKevin also pointed out that since the snow was getting softer than expected, the snow stability could lessen enough to be dangerous. We looked at the headwall ahead of us that we had planned to climb in order to shortcut the normal route, which circumvented the buttress &amp;amp; plateau ahead. This headwall to gain the plateau was probably about 50&lt;sup&gt;oo&lt;/sup&gt; steep and had a large crack at the base of the convex slope at the top. Considering how much the snow had softened over the last 2 hours, would we really want to be descending that slope during the afternoon? \r\n&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;\r\nThis argument had me convinced that it could be foolish to push on ahead, so I threw in my vote to turn back and we all turned around. Any misgivings that we may have had about turning around vanished once Scott saw part of a cornice we had passed earlier calve off and start a small wet sluff. We climbed straight up to the ridge to finish the traverse above the cornices, and beat Casey and Joel back to the saddle. \r\n&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;table&gt;\r\n&lt;tbody&gt;\r\n&lt;tr&gt;\r\n&lt;td&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-kSta9EKf9Jc/TjD_XEvZXrI/AAAAAAAAhF8/yN-2OHd4jW0/s2000/5-22-05-41%2520Light%2520Beam.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-kSta9EKf9Jc/TjD_XEvZXrI/AAAAAAAAhF8/yN-2OHd4jW0/s240/5-22-05-41%2520Light%2520Beam.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Beam of light&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;/td&gt;\r\n&lt;td&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-1TafWPji-xw/TjD_YrQlsNI/AAAAAAAAhGA/F8qALSTdUKM/s2000/5-22-05-42%2520Mt%2520Clark.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-1TafWPji-xw/TjD_YrQlsNI/AAAAAAAAhGA/F8qALSTdUKM/s240/5-22-05-42%2520Mt%2520Clark.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Mt Clark&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;/td&gt;\r\n&lt;td&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-6fMMK79xLWU/UOH_93UOzFI/AAAAAAABnhQ/oMQckUGLqUM/s2000/107564.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-6fMMK79xLWU/UOH_93UOzFI/AAAAAAABnhQ/oMQckUGLqUM/s240/107564.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Joel retreating from the soft snow&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;/td&gt;\r\n&lt;td&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-nfhMpWD_2eI/UOIAHd96I-I/AAAAAAABnhc/ZzvQm1u_zUA/s2000/107565.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-nfhMpWD_2eI/UOIAHd96I-I/AAAAAAABnhc/ZzvQm1u_zUA/s240/107565.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Kevin burning a hole through his pants on glissade&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;/td&gt;\r\n&lt;/tr&gt;\r\n&lt;/tbody&gt;\r\n&lt;/table&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;\r\nFrom the saddle we had a fun glissade back to camp. Kevin tore his pants, I rode further than everyone ahead of me by rowing with my ice axe as I slowed down (cheater! they all yelled), but Scott won the contest for longest distance &amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#147; if he hadn&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;t braked, he would have hit the rocks! Joel walked down behind us after declaring that he didn&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;t know how to self arrest (?!). Then we packed up camp and hurried down the canyon, eager for a late lunch at a Nepalese restaurant that Scott highly recommended.  \r\n&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;\r\nThe hike down was relaxed and non-eventful (apart from a few lessons of the don&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;ts in glissading, resulting in some &amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#152;snow rash&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153; on climbers who shall go unnamed). As we hiked out, Kevin entertained us by sharing with us an experience of his on a mountaineering course he took on Mt Adams. He was climbing as part of a 3-man roped team, and the other client in the group, a Floridian, was having trouble with the altitude. Kevin jokingly prodded the climber on, and after the climber complained, Kevin loudly retorted: \r\n&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;h1&gt;\r\n&lt;a name=\"TOC-Summit-or-Plummet-\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#156;Summit or Plummet!&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#157;&lt;/h1&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;\r\nThe guide laughed so hard that he almost fell over on the steep slope! We all had a good laugh - this was a nice story to lighten the &amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#152;blah&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153; mood of our defeat that day. Luckily, while we didn&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;t summit, we also didn&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;t plummet. We had had a safe trip and had seen some gorgeous scenery, and I would say that this trip certainly ranks as one of my more enjoyable outings in the mountains. \r\n&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;\r\nThanks again everyone, for helping to make this such a great trip!&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;hr&gt;\r\n&lt;hr&gt;\r\n&lt;h2&gt;\r\n&lt;a name=\"TOC-Links\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Links&lt;/h2&gt;\r\n&lt;ul&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://picasaweb.google.com/105894936663116565516/20050529CapitolPk?authuser=0&amp;amp;feat=directlink\"&gt;Picasa Album&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://www.summitpost.org/summit-or-plummet-an-sp-attempt-on-capitol-pk/170130\"&gt;SummitPost TR&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;/ul&gt;\r\n&lt;/div&gt; \r\n'),(29,174,'/mountaineering/trip-reports/colorado/mt-elbert-ne-ridge','Mt Elbert (NE Ridge)','Mt Elbert (NE Ridge)','Trip_Report','content: &lt;div dir=\"ltr\"&gt;\r\n&lt;h1&gt;\r\n&lt;a name=\"TOC-Mt-Elbert-NE-Ridge-\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Mt Elbert (NE Ridge)&lt;/h1&gt;\r\n&lt;hr&gt;\r\n&lt;hr&gt;\r\n&lt;h2&gt;\r\n&lt;a name=\"TOC-August-28-2009\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;August 28, 2009&lt;/h2&gt;\r\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class=\"sites-embed-align-center-wrapping-off\"&gt;&lt;div class=\"sites-embed-border-off sites-embed\" style=\"width:800px;\"&gt;&lt;div class=\"sites-embed-content sites-embed-type-picasa\"&gt;&lt;embed type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" src=\"//picasaweb.google.com/s/c/bin/slideshow.swf\" width=\"800\" height=\"533\" wmode=\"transparent\" pluginspage=\"//www.macromedia.com/go/getflashplayer\" flashvars=\"host=picasaweb.google.com&amp;amp;captions=1&amp;amp;RGB=0x000000&amp;amp;feed=http%3A%2F%2Fpicasaweb.google.com%2Fdata%2Ffeed%2Fapi%2Fuser%2F105894936663116565516%2Falbum%2F20090828MtElbertViaNERidge%3Fkind%3Dphoto%26alt%3Drss%26\"&gt;&lt;/embed&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\r\n&lt;div&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;/div&gt;\r\n&lt;div&gt;I hadn\'t exercised at all for the past 3 months and had gained 15 lbs while working in Qatar.

A big snowstorm passed through the day before and dumped a lot of extremely light snow in the Rockies (a few inches to a few feet deep on top of the rock). This snow made the loose rock on the route very problematic and dangerous.

Fortunately, like saving the star player for the final inning, while I led the earlier wide pitches that Nic was not happy to lead, Nic finished off by leading the face &amp;amp; rotten pitches I was not happy to lead. All in all, 21 hours car-to-car, so it was either that long, or we were that slow. Either way, we had fun.\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\nOr in a more refined way to put it . . .&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\nYPB, a Yosemite Classic, or Classic Yosemite? I\'d say neither, and both. In a way it is classic, but it is NOT a Type I Fun sort of classic that people are accustomed to in Yosemite. There are some brushy sections, and a lot of the rock is loose or exfoliating. It also lacks the elegance of many of the lines in Yosemite, making the routefinding very difficult and the route much more reminiscent of an alpine climb (I have never climbed such an indirect \'direct\' variation). However, there are some stellar pitches, the views from the route are wonderful, and it is a good looong rock climb. The approach is also not to be underestimated involves a lot of hiking, cross-country travel, and scrambling or simul-climbing just to reach the base of the first pitch, nearly 2,000 ft above the Valley floor. However, it is Classic Yosemite in that it has lots of burly wide climbing, stout face climbing, some incredible hand cracks, and huge exposure at the end.&amp;Acirc;&amp;nbsp;&lt;div&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\nI would like to give special thank to Clint Cummins for helping me figure out this route when I was attempting to match the Reid topo to the terrain from recon photos I had taken. Without such help we surely would have gotten even more lost and spent more time climbing in the dark!&amp;Acirc;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;\r\n&lt;div&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\nStandard Wombat Warning applies to this trip report.

Looking around online, including the SuperTopo forums, I became more interested in the route, but information on the route was still vague. So heading in to this climb, there was still a lot of mystery surrounding the route.&amp;Acirc;&amp;nbsp;\r\n&lt;div&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-km3ofoP2Vcw/UJoiBj0kTRI/AAAAAAABco0/ztosi_tPS1E/s2000/2012-04-22%2520-%2520058%2520-%2520Yosemite%2520Falls%2520Right%2520-%2520annotated.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-km3ofoP2Vcw/UJoiBj0kTRI/AAAAAAABco0/ztosi_tPS1E/s600/2012-04-22%2520-%2520058%2520-%2520Yosemite%2520Falls%2520Right%2520-%2520annotated.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Yosemite Point Buttress area from Pharoahs Beard Area.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"http://lh3.ggpht.com/-XRWFVF7whgw/UIj-QNo-OuI/AAAAAAABcGU/98oIH6lRCps/s2000/2012-09-16%252520-%25252012a%252520-%252520Yosemite%252520Point%252520Buttress%252520%252526%252520Lost%252520Arrow%252520Spire%252520from%252520P2%252520of%252520SS%252520-%252520annotated.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"http://lh3.ggpht.com/-XRWFVF7whgw/UIj-QNo-OuI/AAAAAAABcGU/98oIH6lRCps/s640/2012-09-16%252520-%25252012a%252520-%252520Yosemite%252520Point%252520Buttress%252520%252526%252520Lost%252520Arrow%252520Spire%252520from%252520P2%252520of%252520SS%252520-%252520annotated.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Yosemite Point Buttress and Lost Arrow Spire seen from Steck-Salathe.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"http://lh3.ggpht.com/-sMp-4SnUI8Y/UIj-MkVE2QI/AAAAAAABcF8/fozxPrLQVp8/s2000/2012-03-03%252520-%25252011%252520-%252520YPB%252520Beta%252520Shot%252520-%252520annotated.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"http://lh3.ggpht.com/-sMp-4SnUI8Y/UIj-MkVE2QI/AAAAAAABcF8/fozxPrLQVp8/s640/2012-03-03%252520-%25252011%252520-%252520YPB%252520Beta%252520Shot%252520-%252520annotated.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Yosemite Point Buttress from the top of Lena\'s Lieback&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"http://lh4.ggpht.com/-_BfQnirvYy4/UIj-OaiGl8I/AAAAAAABcGE/awhDzLPajrQ/s2000/2012-03-04%252520-%25252002%252520-%252520Yosemite%252520Pt%252520Buttress%252520Close%252520-%252520annotated.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"http://lh4.ggpht.com/-_BfQnirvYy4/UIj-OaiGl8I/AAAAAAABcGE/awhDzLPajrQ/s640/2012-03-04%252520-%25252002%252520-%252520Yosemite%252520Pt%252520Buttress%252520Close%252520-%252520annotated.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Lost Arrow Spire and Yosemite Point Buttress&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\nNic Risser and I were fired up and ready to go for the route in May of 2012. A few days before our climb, I received an urgent e-mail from my friend Val, asking if I had already or was about to climb YPB, and if I handn\'t, to e-mail her right away. Hmm, that\'s strange. I had never even told Val about the climb . . . Also, Val was working with the NPS for determining closures for raptor nesting, so I already knew what this must be about. I was tempted to pretend to not see the e-mail until the next week, but gave in to my conscience and responded.\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\nVal had done a Google search for YPB, and my recon photos for figuring out the route had come up! She had also seen raptors flying right around The Pedestal. The route was slated to be closed that weekend, and we were asked to not go up, even before the closure, as the birds had been sighted. Sigh . . . I had already just lost Arch &amp;amp; Cookie just as I felt ready to venture there, and now this one! So Nic and I waited for Fall . . .\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"http://lh3.ggpht.com/-Md1M2B8jF9A/UIj_vMieLWI/AAAAAAABcQk/SGz16caDB24/s2000/YPB%252520E%252520Side.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"http://lh3.ggpht.com/-Md1M2B8jF9A/UIj_vMieLWI/AAAAAAABcQk/SGz16caDB24/s1200/YPB%252520E%252520Side.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Yosemite Point Buttress as I think the Reid guide shows, seen from the East (image from www.xRez.com).&amp;Acirc;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;i&gt;(We completely missed the last half of P13 and all of P14, so the &amp;Acirc;&amp;nbsp;lines for those sections are my best guess.

We soloed most of it, but as we had never done the climb before and it was dark, we somehow got off route near the top. We belayed the final pitch, which had a piton and some bolts (? The SuperTopo topo doesn\'t show any!), so despite the holdup we were glad to have gotten the rope out. I wasn\'t feeling too hot with the Pop Tart I ate for breakfast, so my stomache jettisoned it and the pre-climb water chug at the base of this mystery pitch.

It starts as a left-side in chimney that pinches you out of the crack and then allows you back inside of more of a squeeze/OW deal. The crack pitches tight again near the top, where I found it best to lieback a bit, turn right side in, and climb the upper part as an OW. Bring your #5 and/or #6 C4 for this. The wide climbing is sustained for about 30m. This pitch should have gone fast, except I had some clusters with my trailed pack getting caught in pro, and I had issue switching sides as the trailed pack held my legs in and I had neglected to flip my gear sling or readjust my rack &lt;i&gt;before&lt;/i&gt;&amp;Acirc;&amp;nbsp;I switched side.

The rock gets mungy and gritty here, and I did some stemming between the rotten corner and a thin crack on the face before the chimney resumed.&amp;Acirc;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;\r\n&lt;div&gt;&amp;Acirc;&amp;nbsp;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"http://lh6.ggpht.com/-0_Na76gXMis/UIj_DaQM19I/AAAAAAABcLc/E223TSEse74/s2000/2012-10-20%252520-%25252036%252520-%252520P5%252520chimney-OW.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"http://lh6.ggpht.com/-0_Na76gXMis/UIj_DaQM19I/AAAAAAABcLc/E223TSEse74/s640/2012-10-20%252520-%25252036%252520-%252520P5%252520chimney-OW.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;P5 chimney-OW. I linked this with P4, and it ended with a large traverse and downclimb. Massive rope drag!&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\nAt a nice ledge with slings, it was tempting to continue straight up a nice looking 5.8-5.9? OW, but the topo had me looking for a traverse right. I clipped the slings, traversed about 20\' over on a ledge, and found thin 5.7 face climbing. This part was trickier to figure out and more runout for the follower than expected. I found an OK cam placement and downclimbed thin 5.7 face for about 20\'. I attempted to get in a &amp;Acirc;&amp;nbsp;small C3 cam in the only possible pro placement, but rope drag popped this out, so the follower has no pro for this entire section after cleaning the first piece. From there I traverse about 15\' right, and then about 10\' back up and right to intersect a corner to set up a belay, hopefully with better fall potential for Nic than if I downclimbed straight down to a ledge below.&amp;Acirc;&amp;nbsp;&amp;Acirc;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;\r\n&lt;div&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\nRope drag for the face climbing was horrendous. I suspect it would have been better to not link P4 &amp;amp; P5, but climb P4 to the start of the traverse.&amp;Acirc;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;\r\n&lt;div&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"http://lh5.ggpht.com/-F9oZatTKrCQ/UIj_EUD3syI/AAAAAAABcLk/Fvk1h9sIbPQ/s2000/2012-10-20%252520-%25252037%252520-%252520P5%2525205_7%252520downclimb%252520%252526%252520traverse.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"http://lh5.ggpht.com/-F9oZatTKrCQ/UIj_EUD3syI/AAAAAAABcLk/Fvk1h9sIbPQ/s640/2012-10-20%252520-%25252037%252520-%252520P5%2525205_7%252520downclimb%252520%252526%252520traverse.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Looking back on the P5 5.7 traverse and downclimb. There really isn\'t any pro for a ways.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\nThe ledge below had a large tree with slings. I suspect we should have gone there and began the P6 traverse from there.&amp;Acirc;&amp;nbsp;&amp;Acirc;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;\r\n&lt;div&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\nNow, this is where it seems a lot of people get lost, and I think we were off-route a bit too. Perhaps Clint can clarify here where we should have gone versus where we wandered, but if I understand where we were aiming for, then I think I worked it out (as shown in the xRez annotated images at the beginning of the report). I\'m uncertain here as what we ultimately did really didn\'t match the topo in any way.&amp;Acirc;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;\r\n&lt;div&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\nBasically, after the 5.7 traverse right and downclimb at the end of P5, end P5 at the ledge with a large tree. DO NOT ascend the crack above, but instead traverse farther right around the arete, reaching a smaller ledge and a piton in a small crack. From here, climb up a shallow gully and climb over and up beyond several corner systems, taking the easiest line, until you are in the last corner next to the white granite wall. From here climb straight up until rope drag or rope length stops you. There are many belay options.&amp;Acirc;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;\r\n&lt;div&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;/div&gt;\r\n&lt;div&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\nWhat we did, in contrast, was we had ended P5 in the crack, and intuition would say to keep climbing up the crack, as although it looked hard, it was clean, protectable, and looked like fun 5.8-5.10. Instead, I climbed partway up until I could take the next crack branching to the right, cutting through the arete (thinking this was the \"hand traverse\" I had noted on a leaning crack on P6 in the Reid Topo). This was harder than it looked! After rounding the corner and seeing sparse face climbing and a good ledge below, I downclimbed, found the piton, saw the ledge ending about there, so I climbed back up to what looked like a better way to get into the next corner system, and picked my way up and across perhaps two more corner systems before I started climbing straight up again. This wandering cost us some time, and the drag was bad.&amp;Acirc;&amp;nbsp;&amp;Acirc;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;\r\n&lt;div&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"http://lh3.ggpht.com/-pBstwKxI4jk/UIj_FgxceDI/AAAAAAABcLs/-FCO8_E5nfo/s2000/2012-10-20%252520-%25252038%252520-%252520Looking%252520down%252520on%252520P6%252520traverse.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"http://lh3.ggpht.com/-pBstwKxI4jk/UIj_FgxceDI/AAAAAAABcLs/-FCO8_E5nfo/s640/2012-10-20%252520-%25252038%252520-%252520Looking%252520down%252520on%252520P6%252520traverse.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Looking down from P6 on the continuing traverse.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"http://lh4.ggpht.com/-hif5XPgBknw/UIj_GlXhn8I/AAAAAAABcL0/hAQIt99V4Xg/s2000/2012-10-20%252520-%25252039%252520-%252520P6%252520More%252520Traversing.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"http://lh4.ggpht.com/-hif5XPgBknw/UIj_GlXhn8I/AAAAAAABcL0/hAQIt99V4Xg/s640/2012-10-20%252520-%25252039%252520-%252520P6%252520More%252520Traversing.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;P6 traversing around more corners. 5.6-5.7.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"http://lh5.ggpht.com/-msneyTUyCGQ/UIj_H_o5ECI/AAAAAAABcL8/Dt4HPvXTBYA/s2000/2012-10-20%252520-%25252040%252520-%252520Looking%252520down%252520P6.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"http://lh5.ggpht.com/-msneyTUyCGQ/UIj_H_o5ECI/AAAAAAABcL8/Dt4HPvXTBYA/s640/2012-10-20%252520-%25252040%252520-%252520Looking%252520down%252520P6.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Looking down P6.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\nRope drag stopped me somewhere near the end of 60m. Nic climbed up to me, and by now I was really dragging. So much wide climbing while hauling a pack had left me worked! Nic was feeling energetic since he had only led P1, so now he led the way. Based off the the xRez photo, we believed we were just short of the large ledge traverse left with the (former) pine tree landmark that used to be visible from the Valley (reports were that rockfall decapitated the tree some years ago). We were maybe 50\' lower than the underside of a hanging flake on the great white granite wall to our right, which formed a small roof and had bushes on top (visible in the XRez photo). We saw what looked like a large ledge up and to the left, with a large dead pine tree trunk.

He continued up to another set of ledges and traversed along. From up there he saw that he should have continued traversing on the ledge, so he downclimbed as he traversed to intersect the route.&amp;Acirc;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;\r\n&lt;div&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"http://lh5.ggpht.com/-p9xsKceH6jM/UIj_Kz9hV9I/AAAAAAABcMM/EGR5EuZMFJ8/s2000/2012-10-20%252520-%25252042%252520-%252520P7%252520Old%252520Big%252520Tree%252520landmark.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"http://lh5.ggpht.com/-p9xsKceH6jM/UIj_Kz9hV9I/AAAAAAABcMM/EGR5EuZMFJ8/s640/2012-10-20%252520-%25252042%252520-%252520P7%252520Old%252520Big%252520Tree%252520landmark.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;P7 old Big Tree landmark.

It is about 40\' and line with decomposing granite. Although the rock was unpleasant, the chimney was not. Nic made short work leading this, and neither of us needed to trail our packs (as we had on P2, P3, P4, &amp;amp; P5). The chimney is easy and has a lot of features and a nice jam crack inside.&amp;Acirc;&amp;nbsp;&amp;Acirc;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;\r\n&lt;div&gt;&amp;Acirc;&amp;nbsp;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"http://lh4.ggpht.com/-UjzRpXC3I2g/UIj_OOSrnHI/AAAAAAABcMk/thk_LMD4Bak/s2000/2012-10-20%252520-%25252045%252520-%252520P8%252520Easy%252520Chimney.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"http://lh4.ggpht.com/-UjzRpXC3I2g/UIj_OOSrnHI/AAAAAAABcMk/thk_LMD4Bak/s640/2012-10-20%252520-%25252045%252520-%252520P8%252520Easy%252520Chimney.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;P8 easy chimney.

The rock is as rotten as the Rotten Chimney pitch, though.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\nAtop this chimney the route turns a corner on the left, ending up on a ledge back on the south side of the formation (pitches 3-8 were all on the east side). From here you turn back right and ascend another easy chimney. This one is wide, mostly stemming, and you tunnel behind a large chockstone. The Reid guide shows P8 ending atop this chimney after it slants left, but Nic stopped short, on a ledge to the right of the chimney just after the chockstone. The next bit was all unprotectable squeeze and he didn\'t quite feel up for leading it. This wasn\'t a problem, though, as he was nearly out of rope anyways.&amp;Acirc;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;\r\n&lt;div&gt;&amp;Acirc;&amp;nbsp;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"http://lh3.ggpht.com/-WBWlwH2xT4Y/UIj_PVl1koI/AAAAAAABcMs/EwOqcrPtiMY/s2000/2012-10-20%252520-%25252046%252520-%252520P8%252520chockstone%252520chimney.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"http://lh3.ggpht.com/-WBWlwH2xT4Y/UIj_PVl1koI/AAAAAAABcMs/EwOqcrPtiMY/s640/2012-10-20%252520-%25252046%252520-%252520P8%252520chockstone%252520chimney.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;P8 chimney with a chockstone tunnel through. Wee. This chimney was also pretty easy to climb with a pack on.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\nI linked the remained of what Reid calls P8 to reach P9. Since this was nearly a full rope length, I think someone is cheating when they numbered these pitches. This is another pack-trailing pitch.&amp;Acirc;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;\r\n&lt;div&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"http://lh5.ggpht.com/-DMRh5Z93m9w/UIj_QmYa_HI/AAAAAAABcM0/uY7ILA8OX9g/s2000/2012-10-20%252520-%25252047%252520-%252520P9%252520OW-Squeeze.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"http://lh5.ggpht.com/-DMRh5Z93m9w/UIj_QmYa_HI/AAAAAAABcM0/uY7ILA8OX9g/s640/2012-10-20%252520-%25252047%252520-%252520P9%252520OW-Squeeze.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;P9 OW-squeeze. There is no pro in this apart from a thin crack out on the face about halfway up. Fortunately it is secure.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\nI made quick work of the squeeze and began traversing left (west) all the way around the formation to reach the base of the P10 Rotten Chimney, which is formed between the main wall and The Pedestal leaning against it. This traverse is pretty long, maybe 100\', and you down climb maybe 40\'. It is mostly unprotectable and has some of the worst granite I have ever climbed. You could rip off granite chunks with your hands, willy nilly, and the face was nothing but ball bearings of gritty granite. You could never rub enough off to get smooth surface. The ledges were covered in sand and chunks of granite grit and scree. At least it was no harder than low 5th. This had me wary of what the Rotten Chimney would be like.&amp;Acirc;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;\r\n&lt;div&gt;&amp;Acirc;&amp;nbsp;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\nI turned the last corner, going farther over and down than expected, then walked partway up the chute until I could make a small, 2-piece anchor in the wall on my right. I had read reports of there being no secure anchor here, but mine seemed all right, albeit not the best positioned.&amp;Acirc;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;\r\n&lt;div&gt;&amp;Acirc;&amp;nbsp;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"http://lh6.ggpht.com/-TyDDfKSTtC8/UIj_UOjNfXI/AAAAAAABcNM/MVyH-aFCSPc/s2000/2012-10-20%252520-%25252049%252520-%252520Sentinel%252520Rock%252520from%252520base%252520of%252520P10.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"http://lh6.ggpht.com/-TyDDfKSTtC8/UIj_UOjNfXI/AAAAAAABcNM/MVyH-aFCSPc/s640/2012-10-20%252520-%25252049%252520-%252520Sentinel%252520Rock%252520from%252520base%252520of%252520P10.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Sentinel Rock from the base of P10.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\nBy this point it was apparent that we might have trouble ahead. The sun was close to setting, and we still had 5 more pitches to climb to reach the top! As soon as Nic reached me I took off, trailing the pack for the last time. The rotten chimney is a left-side in back-to-foot chimney and there is no pro until you reach the chockstones atop the first step. Still, this was only about 10\' up and not too hard - maybe 5.6-5.7, but the rock on the foot side of the chimney is covered in exfoliating flakes. Still not too bad, as with care you could find clear spaces to smear your feet, or if lacking that, scrape away the granite flakes with your toe to make a good foot placement.&amp;Acirc;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;\r\n&lt;div&gt;&amp;Acirc;&amp;nbsp;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"http://lh5.ggpht.com/-_BWMH2AFn8M/UIj_ScLvIOI/AAAAAAABcM8/goUvCVwp-WQ/s2000/2012-10-20%252520-%25252050%252520-%252520P10%252520Rotten%252520Chimney.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"http://lh5.ggpht.com/-_BWMH2AFn8M/UIj_ScLvIOI/AAAAAAABcM8/goUvCVwp-WQ/s640/2012-10-20%252520-%25252050%252520-%252520P10%252520Rotten%252520Chimney.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;P10 Rotten Chimney.

I just stopped caring about kicking down rocks of all sizes at this point. This part was more like 4th to low 5th, though. I took an early exit, which was a mistake. There is a rope-eating notch between the boulders and even with a directional, rope drag was awful, and I had to set up the belay specifically to work with the directional to keep the rope out of the crack. We then had to move the belay down and onto the giant chockstone to properly belay P11.&amp;Acirc;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;\r\n&lt;div&gt;&amp;Acirc;&amp;nbsp;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"http://lh4.ggpht.com/-YUG1Q3fY-6g/UIj_VSFKHvI/AAAAAAABcNc/m1O8GQv3Nco/s2000/2012-10-20%25640-%25252052%252520-%252520P10%252520Rotten%252520Chimney%252520Tunnel%252520Through%252520-%252520annotated.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"http://lh4.ggpht.com/-YUG1Q3fY-6g/UIj_VSFKHvI/AAAAAAABcNc/m1O8GQv3Nco/s640/2012-10-20%252520-%25252052%252520-%252520P10%252520Rotten%252520Chimney%252520Tunnel%252520Through%252520-%252520annotated.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;P10 Rotten chimney tunnel through.

He would lead the last 4 pitches to the rim. Pitch 11 starts hard right off the deck at solid 5.9 as you step off the Pedestal above exposure. Nick had to climb about 10 ft off the ledge before he could get in his first piece, an OK #2 Camalot in a shallow flare, and continued up to the first of many ancient pitons. The first piton is high and to the right, with some long tat on it. From there he worked down and left to another piton, then high to step around the corner to access the 5.9 lieback. Following this section the face climbing definitely felt like 5.9+ to me, and you\'d definitely take some good swings if you fell. If the pitons held it would be all right, but I don\'t know if I\'d want to test those pitons!&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"http://lh5.ggpht.com/-PAGxKAcUqFY/UIj_aBiA7sI/AAAAAAABcOM/b6V9XCJmZQg/s2000/2012-10-20%252520-%25252055%252520-%252520Nic%252520Leading%252520P11%252520Traverse%252520at%252520night.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"http://lh5.ggpht.com/-PAGxKAcUqFY/UIj_aBiA7sI/AAAAAAABcOM/b6V9XCJmZQg/s640/2012-10-20%252520-%25252055%252520-%252520Nic%252520Leading%252520P11%252520Traverse%252520at%252520night.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Nic leading the P11 5.9 traverse at night.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\nI watched Nic\'s headlamp recede into darkness as he rounded the corner and made steady progress up the pitch.

Pitons were still the only protection for the next little bit, but gradually the crack widened to accept gear. Higher up there were still a couple more pitons and even a bolt out on the face to the left. The \'lieback\' was sustained 5.9 for maybe the next 50 ft or so before it gradually eased off to 5.8 as it turned more vertical. Although there were a few slightly mungy parts, the pitch was very high quality. A \"lieback\" is the best way to describe it, but it really was strange, requiring a lot of mixed techniques. Jams, crimps, stems, scums, smears, none of the moves were repetitive and it felt more like a face climb than a crack climb.&amp;Acirc;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;\r\n&lt;div&gt;&amp;Acirc;&amp;nbsp;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"http://lh4.ggpht.com/-qjPrY6pYpa8/UIj_gk99n3I/AAAAAAABcO0/o1k6drNKoRs/s2000/2012-10-20%252520-%25252060%252520-%252520P11%252520Old%252520Angle%252520Piton.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"http://lh4.ggpht.com/-qjPrY6pYpa8/UIj_gk99n3I/AAAAAAABcO0/o1k6drNKoRs/s640/2012-10-20%252520-%25252060%252520-%252520P11%252520Old%252520Angle%252520Piton.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;P11 old angle piton.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\nI had been worried about the P11 &amp;amp; P12 belays as one of the few reports I could find on the route said the P11 belay was poor and exposed, and the P12 belay was a hanging belay on pins. We didn\'t find anything like this. The P11 belay was off of a good piton and solid gear, at a nice ledge.\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\nHowever, as best as we could follow the topo and get a good belay, P12 started off at 5.10R before reaching the wonderful hand crack. Nic had to downclimb about 20 ft before doing a very difficult friction traverse around the corner into a wild, wide stem. From there he zipped up the crack about 30 ft before placing his first piece so that I had proper protection to follow the entry. Thanks!&amp;Acirc;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;\r\n&lt;div&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;i&gt;(Looking at some other climbers\' photos, it appears you could end P11 early and belay in the bombay chimney beneath the stem. The climb up to the crack looks tricky but probably not nearly as difficult as the face traverse. However, the belay might have been more marginal. I wonder if that is the better way though . . .)&lt;/i&gt;&amp;Acirc;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;\r\n&lt;div&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"http://lh4.ggpht.com/-IaLyfyRIW0s/UIj_hQiGyhI/AAAAAAABcO8/uvNClT2ebZ4/s2000/2012-10-20%252520-%25252061%252520-%252520Nic%252520Leading%252520P2%252520crack.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"http://lh4.ggpht.com/-IaLyfyRIW0s/UIj_hQiGyhI/AAAAAAABcO8/uvNClT2ebZ4/s640/2012-10-20%252520-%25252061%252520-%252520Nic%252520Leading%252520P2%252520crack.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Nic leading P12 crack. Such a sweet crack!&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\nOnce Nic was in the crack with gear, he took off and made short work with the rest of the pitch, only slowing down at the very awkward roof-corner crux at the end. The Reid guide shows the P12 belay here, but with the 60m rope Nic was able to go up a ways further on easy ground to a nice, large ledge and a small gear anchor. I think we made the anchor at the optional belay between P12 &amp;Acirc;&amp;nbsp;&amp;amp; P13 in the Reid guide.&amp;Acirc;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;\r\n&lt;div&gt;&amp;Acirc;&amp;nbsp;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\nWhen I followed, I was slow on the face traverse - it was very hard and intimidating to follow. Props to Nic on the great lead! Once I was in the crack, I had a lot of fun. Pitch 12 and Pitch 3 are definitely my favorite pitches of the climb. Pitch 12 had about 150 ft of sustained 5.8-5.9 hand to fist crack climbing.&amp;Acirc;&amp;nbsp;&amp;Acirc;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;\r\n&lt;div&gt;&amp;Acirc;&amp;nbsp;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"http://lh3.ggpht.com/-TEthu4d4PyA/UIj_jkZM6iI/AAAAAAABcPM/RLPC44vPeDk/s2000/2012-10-20%252520-%25252062%252520-%252520Following%252520P12%252520Hand%252520Crack.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"http://lh3.ggpht.com/-TEthu4d4PyA/UIj_jkZM6iI/AAAAAAABcPM/RLPC44vPeDk/s640/2012-10-20%252520-%25252062%252520-%252520Following%252520P12%252520Hand%252520Crack.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;P12 crack. Such a sweet crack!&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\nThe final 30 ft before the roof crux was the best, with tight hands (Red Camalot) in a laser cut crack that leaned about 50-60 degrees, requiring an interesting sequence of movements with one foot flagging on the face, one foot in the crack, and your arms twisted around to be jammed in the crack. It was a nice endurance workout.&amp;Acirc;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;\r\n&lt;div&gt;&amp;Acirc;&amp;nbsp;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\nThe roof-corner was mungy and felt more like a bouldering problem to surmount. It was protected nicely by two pitons high and left. After the roof I made quick work getting up to Nic. During the time we were climbing pitches 11 &amp;amp; 12, we heard shouts from the Valley floor. It sounded like someone was shouting my name. Since we knew friends down there who were aware of our plans, we figured our lights high up on the wall were rather conspicuous, so as we climbed on we occasionally shouted and yodeled back.&amp;Acirc;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;\r\n&lt;div&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\nThese last two pitches were definitely 5 star pitches. Despite the darkness and fatigue, we were having a blast. Still, we had the last two pitches left, which we had heard were quit bad . . .\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;h2&gt;\r\n&lt;a name=\"TOC-Exit-Pitches\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Exit Pitches&lt;/h2&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-Lud38VifxVA/ULnbNZM4hmI/AAAAAAABj1s/dV3eTTGs4Zo/s2000/YPB%2520E%2520Side%2520-%2520top%2520close.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-Lud38VifxVA/ULnbNZM4hmI/AAAAAAABj1s/dV3eTTGs4Zo/s640/YPB%2520E%2520Side%2520-%2520top%2520close.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;My best deduction of where we went vs. where the Reid topo says to go&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-Tt_lT0_nM10/ULnb-5XDK3I/AAAAAAABj1o/Y1eo4uNqYCs/s2000/YPB%2520S%2520Side%2520-%2520close.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-Tt_lT0_nM10/ULnb-5XDK3I/AAAAAAABj1o/Y1eo4uNqYCs/s640/YPB%2520S%2520Side%2520-%2520close.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;My best deduction of where we went vs. where the Reid topo says to go&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\nI would call Yosemite Point Buttress, \'Direct\', a 3-4 star climb if it weren\'t for the last two pitches. These last two pitches were frightening and really sucked. Perhaps some of this was due to us getting off route in the dark, though. Once again, I\'d like to give major props to Nic for leading these!\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\nNic led off left on a large that pinched down to an extremely exposed, but easy traverse. Class 4, but no pro and very rotten rock. Basically P13 is low 5th, but is somewhat runout due to the rock being too rotten for pro. It also breaks off in your hands, so take care with what you grab. It was quite interesting to break off large chunks of rock and never hear the impact as they sailed off into the darkness. There was also a lot of dirt and sand mixed that blew into your face - I was still finding bits of P13-14 lodged in my nose and ears for the next few days and several rounds of showering.&amp;Acirc;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;\r\n&lt;div&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\nI suspect after the first traverse left (about 50 ft or so) and short climb up, Nic should have hung a hard right and traversed back that way, but it was hard to tell in the dark with our headlamps. Nic went more straight up and left, and found himself on a 5.10a finger crack at one point. Following this pitch, I followed up a detached flake. After breaking off the edges from some hand jams and stepping on the edge of the flake (resulting in some flailing to catch myself from falling), I really didn\'t like climbing right up the 4\' wide flake as the entire thing vibrated. I was waiting for the entire thing to break off once I was fully bear hugging it. At last the terrain eased and I traversed up a slot and ledge system to the right, reaching Nic at a nice belay at a large pine tree.&amp;Acirc;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;\r\n&lt;div&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\nThe ants here were active and did a good amount of biting as I belayed Nic up the final pitch. He saw a nice long ledge system traversing right and gradually up at class 4, but he wanted off the route NOW! Like an angry beast, he attacked the final 15 ft headwall directly. He made grunting noises on this part even louder than the wide pitches below. I could tell he was struggling to take an unnecessary, direct finish.

The right set of double cracks would be nicer for the most part, except for the large moving chockstone!\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"http://lh4.ggpht.com/-6z-WafNfX98/T7XoLLFWEbI/AAAAAAABGB4/9JUhjAqbewY/s2000/2012-04-28%252520-%25252032%252520-%252520Castleton%252520Tower%252520-%252520P2%252520Steep%252520Climbing.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"http://lh4.ggpht.com/-6z-WafNfX98/T7XoLLFWEbI/AAAAAAABGB4/9JUhjAqbewY/s640/2012-04-28%252520-%25252032%252520-%252520Castleton%252520Tower%252520-%252520P2%252520Steep%252520Climbing.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;P2, starting up the left crack before a steep leaning stem to get into the center crack.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"http://lh3.ggpht.com/-QbUwbLl79rs/T7XoMrSzFaI/AAAAAAABGB8/BufXpYePKeY/s2000/2012-04-28%252520-%25252033%252520-%252520Castleton%252520Tower%252520-%252520P2%252520calcuite%252520horror%252520show.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"http://lh3.ggpht.com/-QbUwbLl79rs/T7XoMrSzFaI/AAAAAAABGB8/BufXpYePKeY/s640/2012-04-28%252520-%25252033%252520-%252520Castleton%252520Tower%252520-%252520P2%252520calcuite%252520horror%252520show.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;P2 calcite horror show.

At first all that we could hear was muffled talking, but as I climbed higher the grunting, pounding and muffled cursing emanating from the rock grew more distinct. Every now and then I looked deep into the crack to see if I could see the climbers, but the crack still pinched off deep inside.\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"http://lh6.ggpht.com/-HL1VE1-Q1JE/T7XoQdmXccI/AAAAAAABGCU/XK_Yj4_Q0Lo/s2000/2012-04-28%252520-%25252039%252520-%252520Castleton%252520Tower%252520-%252520P3%252520OW%252520Crux%252520at%252520Second%252520Bolt.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"http://lh6.ggpht.com/-HL1VE1-Q1JE/T7XoQdmXccI/AAAAAAABGCU/XK_Yj4_Q0Lo/s640/2012-04-28%252520-%25252039%252520-%252520Castleton%252520Tower%252520-%252520P3%252520OW%252520Crux%252520at%252520Second%252520Bolt.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;P3 5.9+ OW crux, protected by this bolt. I found the best way around this crux was to do some wide &amp;amp; delicate stemming on the calcite around the OW, especially on the left wall.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\nI launched into the offwidth crux. It was a nasty crux, as the crack gradually pinches down, and the opens up again, all the while lined with slick calcite. I clipped the last bolt and squirmed about a body length higher before I got stuck. I couldn\'t fit my hips through the pinch, the opening above was too wide for a strong chickenwing, and the crack below was too wide for foot stacking, and too slick to push up with my legs.\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\n\"Mooo! Moo!\"\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\nWas that me moaning is despair? Or was that noise in my head? In a way yes to both, but also as I struggled, I could hear the cows mooing in the pasture far below, which seemed to be a bizarre backdrop to desert tower climbing.\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;i&gt;(The North Chimney party later said that while they could hear me through the rock as well, all they could hear was heavy breathing and no cursing, grunting, or moaning, so I guess I kept better composure than I thought.)&lt;/i&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"http://lh5.ggpht.com/-OLBjqJgF6Kg/T7XoQ608BwI/AAAAAAABGCY/F4cfCvoSt6o/s2000/2012-04-28%252520-%25252040%252520-%252520Castleton%252520Tower%252520-%252520P3%252520OW%252520at%252520Crux.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"http://lh5.ggpht.com/-OLBjqJgF6Kg/T7XoQ608BwI/AAAAAAABGCY/F4cfCvoSt6o/s640/2012-04-28%252520-%25252040%252520-%252520Castleton%252520Tower%252520-%252520P3%252520OW%252520at%252520Crux.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Inside the P3 OW crux. The next body length here was tricky and mostly required climbing outside the crack.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\nEventually I realized that I would have to move my hips outside the crack to get around the constriction. The problem was that I had lousy footing and no way to lock off my arms in the crack, so the move leaning out of the crack would be very precarious. I remembered seeing some face features and decided it would be a better option to climb around this constriction rather than through it, so I slithered a short ways back down the crack to try out the bypass idea.\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"http://lh6.ggpht.com/-5dQeZb7BErU/T7XoRUN7TNI/AAAAAAABGCc/3wP7wltHgfM/s2000/2012-04-28%252520-%25252041%252520-%252520Castleton%252520Tower%252520-%252520Steep%252520View%252520Down%252520at%252520P3%252520OW%252520at%252520Crux.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"http://lh6.ggpht.com/-5dQeZb7BErU/T7XoRUN7TNI/AAAAAAABGCc/3wP7wltHgfM/s640/2012-04-28%252520-%25252041%252520-%252520Castleton%252520Tower%252520-%252520Steep%252520View%252520Down%252520at%252520P3%252520OW%252520at%252520Crux.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Looking down from the P3 OW crux.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\nIt worked!

After this, I had another unexpected free section that was hard enough to reach that I had to disconnect from an aid ladder to finish to the top.

Although Dirk missed out on this bizarre adventure, I made it up to him during some long belays later in the trip :-)\r\n&lt;div&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;hr&gt;\r\n&lt;hr&gt;\r\n\r\nSo I was quite surprised to find out how difficult it is to climb over bulges on aid, and even that overhanging techniques don\'t really work. After getting pretty smooth at overhanging bolt ladders, and after playing around on Happy Turk, I think I have an idea of how one approaches these differently, and have put together some quick diagrams below showing my thoughts. I\'m happy to get any feedback from the aid masters out there in terms of illustrating these techniques, or if there are better ways to overcome these obstacles!\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\nIn the diagrams below, the red arrows indicate reactions against the climber (e.g. aid ladder on the feet, bolt on the pulling hand). The green arrow indicates the tendency of the body to move that the climber needs to overcome, blue arrow is roughly the center of mass of the climber. Red limbs are those pressing and yellow limbs are those pulling.\r\n\r\n&lt;h2&gt;\r\n&lt;a name=\"TOC-Aid-Climbing-an-Overhang\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Aid Climbing an Overhang&lt;/h2&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-Rkx_fhIzvas/UMgg5ChtVdI/AAAAAAABnJc/el9StU6IYUE/s2000/2012-11-10%2520-%252013iiz%2520-%2520Bolts%2520Overhang%25200.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-Rkx_fhIzvas/UMgg5ChtVdI/AAAAAAABnJc/el9StU6IYUE/s512/2012-11-10%2520-%252013iiz%2520-%2520Bolts%2520Overhang%25200.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;1 - Unstable position, so the climber will swing.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-T-_4IqKU5z8/UMgg_1X7C9I/AAAAAAABnJg/TYpn1AlZxCM/s2000/2012-11-10%2520-%252013iiz%2520-%2520Bolts%2520Overhang%25201.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-T-_4IqKU5z8/UMgg_1X7C9I/AAAAAAABnJg/TYpn1AlZxCM/s512/2012-11-10%2520-%252013iiz%2520-%2520Bolts%2520Overhang%25201.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;2 - Stable position.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-vk0cfBEzDOo/UMghATldZCI/AAAAAAABnJk/9aoDLhElgxA/s2000/2012-11-10%2520-%252013iiz%2520-%2520Bolts%2520Overhang%25202.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-vk0cfBEzDOo/UMghATldZCI/AAAAAAABnJk/9aoDLhElgxA/s512/2012-11-10%2520-%252013iiz%2520-%2520Bolts%2520Overhang%25202.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;3 - Right leg is levering off the wall, or possibly pressing if there are features.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-aUJKRy_z8h0/UMghLQEs42I/AAAAAAABnJo/swhmzyODYmI/s2000/2012-11-10%2520-%252013iiz%2520-%2520Bolts%2520Overhang%25203.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-aUJKRy_z8h0/UMghLQEs42I/AAAAAAABnJo/swhmzyODYmI/s512/2012-11-10%2520-%252013iiz%2520-%2520Bolts%2520Overhang%25203.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;4 - Pulling up on bolt while standing in the aider, levering the right leg on the wall to help resist the tendency to overturn.

Dirk solidly led the semi-runout Lizard Rock, which was literally a few minutes\' walk from our campsite. We then headed over to Arches in hopes of climbing Dark Angel with the remainder of the day. It has a long approach compared to most other climbs in the park, but the hike is on a well-maintained trail and is a very scenic and a nostalgic one for me. We had just enough time to climb the spire and make it back to the TH before dark.\r\n\r\n\r\n&lt;hr&gt;\r\n&lt;hr&gt;\r\n&lt;h2&gt;\r\n&lt;a name=\"TOC-Lizard-Rock-Entry-Lizards-5.9--PG13-\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Lizard Rock, \"Entry Lizards\" (5.9- PG13)&lt;/h2&gt;\r\n\r\nAfter a long and stressful day learning more about what aid climbing is like in the Fishers, we had a night of surprisingly hard rain (considering the forecast didn\'t call for any!). At one point we awoke to a loud rumble as part of a cliff above us broke off. I guess it was a good thing that we called it quits in the Fishers yesterday! Still, things seemed to be drying out well in the morning, and we couldn\'t bear to leave without indulging in one last temptation, a quick tick of climbing Lizard Rock. It is only about a 3 minute walk from our campsite, so it was a nice way to start the day. The standard routes on it are rated \'R\' in our various guidebooks, and the rock was potentially weaker, but Dirk being ever the adventurer was game to check it out and give leading it a go. I was happy to just follow along for a casual last day of my desert trip.&lt;/div&gt;\r\n&lt;div&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"http://lh4.ggpht.com/-TW-T_AhqhzI/ULF-jbqll_I/AAAAAAABjK8/vJMRQT6Pypg/s2000/2012-11-18%252520-%25252002%252520-%252520Lizard%252520Rock%252520-%252520from%252520the%252520East.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"http://lh4.ggpht.com/-TW-T_AhqhzI/ULF-jbqll_I/AAAAAAABjK8/vJMRQT6Pypg/s800/2012-11-18%252520-%25252002%252520-%252520Lizard%252520Rock%252520-%252520from%252520the%252520East.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Lizard Rock&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\nDirk chose to do a combination of routes that starts with Entry Fee (5.7 R) and finishes on 5.8+ to 5.9- terrain on Leapin Lizards (5.10a R).

I took this photo in the late 1990s in B&amp;amp;W with a film SLR when I was still in high school and before I had ever done any rock climbing. During all of the times in my childhood that I had hiked out here, I had no idea one could climb atop that thing!&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\r\n&lt;div&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;/div&gt;\r\n\r\n\r\nLizard Head went very quickly, and we still had a full day left to climb before driving back to Salt Lake City that night. The skies still looked like there was a potential for rain, so we decided to do something non-committing and nice to visit even if the rock seemed too wet to climb. So we drove into Arches to hike out to Dark Angel and maybe climb the West Face.&amp;Acirc;&amp;nbsp;I was a bit wary about the route as one of the guidebooks that was as recent as the 90s reported the 5.9 fingers to be sandy, the bolts to be of poor enough quality that you wouldn\'t want to take a free-climbing fall on them, and a sandy runout 5.4 finish.&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-TN9VqkhHSF8/UO5fKEzXItI/AAAAAAABoKQ/1TW_kgGrDJM/s2000/2012-11-18%2520-%252030%2520-%2520Dark%2520Angel%2520-%2520West%2520Face%2520-%2520annotated.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-TN9VqkhHSF8/UO5fKEzXItI/AAAAAAABoKQ/1TW_kgGrDJM/s800/2012-11-18%2520-%252030%2520-%2520Dark%2520Angel%2520-%2520West%2520Face%2520-%2520annotated.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\nWe had a nice hike out, and were happy to note that the rainy night we had in the Fishers had not extended as far west as Arches, as everything was very dry. One memorable part of this climb is the trail to Double Arch is one of the more popular trails in Arches, but Dark Angel, about 4 miles in at the end of the trail, is the only feature that attracts the occasional climber. So here we were speeding down the trail with our ropes and climbing gear, passing families, foreign tourists, and groups of school kids. We certainly got a few looks as we hiked in!&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"http://lh4.ggpht.com/-P2OtallL7N0/ULF--f65TxI/AAAAAAABjMk/-tK9bBxu7WA/s2000/2012-11-18%252520-%25252025%252520-%252520Dark%252520Angel.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"http://lh4.ggpht.com/-P2OtallL7N0/ULF--f65TxI/AAAAAAABjMk/-tK9bBxu7WA/s800/2012-11-18%252520-%25252025%252520-%252520Dark%252520Angel.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Dark Angel from Double Arch&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"http://lh4.ggpht.com/-4wW_5Iz5aOo/ULF_AVsR_DI/AAAAAAABjMs/9YleUpYDaVk/s2000/2012-11-18%252520-%25252026a%252520-%252520Dark%252520Angel%252520-%252520End%252520of%252520Trail%252520-%252520by%252520Dirk%252520Summers.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"http://lh4.ggpht.com/-4wW_5Iz5aOo/ULF_AVsR_DI/AAAAAAABjMs/9YleUpYDaVk/s800/2012-11-18%252520-%25252026a%252520-%252520Dark%252520Angel%252520-%252520End%252520of%252520Trail%252520-%252520by%252520Dirk%252520Summers.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Always doing 110%, we went beyond the end of the trail.

Fortunately it is well protected, but suffers from similar problems to the awkward 5.7 finish of P1. On this one you end up humping the rock corners as you slide up, a cheval, on the left edge while yarding on a right-hand hand jam.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\nSince I was wary of what the bolt ladder would require to aid (since there is no way I\'m doing 5.11 face &amp;amp; slab yet!), I brought some aiders and daisies to be on the safe side. These weren\'t necessary at all as the bolts are very close and the rock has plenty of features to make French-freeing easy. The difficulty relents pretty fast, too, so I still free-climbed about half of the pitch.&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"http://lh6.ggpht.com/-bzVpksQAh5Y/ULF_bA7Q4-I/AAAAAAABjOI/zmdHqP2bQnk/s2000/2012-11-18%252520-%25252038%252520-%252520Dark%252520Angel%252520-%252520West%252520Face%252520-%252520P2%252520free%252520crux.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"http://lh6.ggpht.com/-bzVpksQAh5Y/ULF_bA7Q4-I/AAAAAAABjOI/zmdHqP2bQnk/s800/2012-11-18%252520-%25252038%252520-%252520Dark%252520Angel%252520-%252520West%252520Face%252520-%252520P2%252520free%252520crux.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;First bolts, at the free crux (5.10d to 5.11a) (only the first clip is a drilled angle).

It also isn\'t runout. Even the final stretch to the summit could be protected with some cams or tricams if you wished.

Too good to be true, and as we got close we could see slings on an anchor. It still looks like a great line to come back to. Next I led Chinese Eyes (5.9+) and we did a few TR laps on it. We finished off the day by climbing one of the best routes in Arches and one of my favorite desert towers: The Three Penguins. We climbed the Right Chimney, which has an overhanging 5.10c thin hands section on P1, and then a 5.10a/b OW on P2. The climb was sustained and, while sandy, not as bad as many other routes in the park.\r\n\r\n&lt;hr&gt;\r\n&lt;hr&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;h2&gt;\r\n&lt;a name=\"TOC-False-FA\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;False FA&lt;/h2&gt;\r\n&lt;div&gt;The day started with us checking out a promising line we saw from the road. We couldn\'t find it in any of the guidebooks (of +3 we had that covered the area) so we decided to check it out. Could it really be a good route that hadn\'t been done yet? There were no slings at the top . . . As Arches no longer allows any bolts to be placed, we figured we could simul-rapp off of opposite sides of the fin after finishing. Unfortunately it was too good to be true, as when we walked a few hundred yards up a creek bed towards it, I spotted some slings hanging from bolts on the backside of a tower that formed out of the corner. Doh! It looked like a nice line, but as it wasn\'t as tempting as a FA, we went on to some guaranteed classics. It is probably in the 5.10+ to 5.11 range. I\'ve mentally filed this one away to check out next time . . .\r\n&lt;/div&gt;\r\n&lt;div&gt;\r\n&lt;div&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;/div&gt;\r\n&lt;div&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"http://lh3.ggpht.com/-tGlKm9PYQyI/UK62atBKIdI/AAAAAAABid4/Xd5GZgNMs4k/s2000/2012-11-13%252520-%25252002%252520-%252520Mystery%252520Climb.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"http://lh3.ggpht.com/-tGlKm9PYQyI/UK62atBKIdI/AAAAAAABid4/Xd5GZgNMs4k/s800/2012-11-13%252520-%25252002%252520-%252520Mystery%252520Climb.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Mystery Climb, ascending the corner to the right.

Dirk had already done this one but was nice enough to indulge me in returning to it to run a few laps. Coffee came with us to the base. I\'m starting to warm up to these short approaches. This one was only about 15 minutes of easy hiking in a beautiful setting :-)&lt;/div&gt;\r\n&lt;div&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;/div&gt;\r\n&lt;div&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-G3SHpgKm1N4/T7SrYgay1TI/AAAAAAABFb4/ldG3A2fq62w/s2000/2012-04-29%2520-%252020%2520-%2520Chinese%2520Eyes.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-G3SHpgKm1N4/T7SrYgay1TI/AAAAAAABFb4/ldG3A2fq62w/s800/2012-04-29%2520-%252020%2520-%2520Chinese%2520Eyes.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Chinese Eyes area seen from the Courthouse Wash parking area.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;/div&gt;\r\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\r\n&lt;div&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-ov5wCvN1TXM/T7SrZnTUEYI/AAAAAAABFb8/dwOKYcZ9kBQ/s2000/2012-04-29%2520-%252021%2520-%2520Chinese%2520Eyes.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-ov5wCvN1TXM/T7SrZnTUEYI/AAAAAAABFb8/dwOKYcZ9kBQ/s800/2012-04-29%2520-%252021%2520-%2520Chinese%2520Eyes.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Chinese Eyes seen from the Courthouse Wash parking area.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;/div&gt;\r\n&lt;div&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;/div&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"http://lh6.ggpht.com/-nZQmNkE41Y0/UK62dMt_vtI/AAAAAAABieE/Z37Givc_UT4/s2000/2012-11-13%252520-%25252005%252520-%252520100%252520Yard%252520Wall%252520-%252520Chinese%252520Eyes.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"http://lh6.ggpht.com/-nZQmNkE41Y0/UK62dMt_vtI/AAAAAAABieE/Z37Givc_UT4/s800/2012-11-13%252520-%25252005%252520-%252520100%252520Yard%252520Wall%252520-%252520Chinese%252520Eyes.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Approaching Chinese Eyes.

However, several other guidebooks called the crack 5.9+, and I\'d agree that it is more like 5.9+, and not too sandy as compared to some of the other climbs we had done in the park. Still, compared to Owl Rock (which is NOT representative of Arches climbing) and Indian Creek, this crack is less secure in jams, smearing, and pro, so you should have your desert climbing lead head on for this one.&lt;/div&gt;\r\n&lt;div&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;/div&gt;\r\n&lt;div&gt;\r\n&lt;i&gt;Note: I didn\'t think too seriously about cracks being described as sandy until I experienced some in Arches. Your feet slip much more on the facey bits when there is loose sand around, and you can seriously feel your hand and foot jams are not as secure. You have to set them harder or pull harder to the side to get the secure. I can also visualize much more here either cams blowing out the rock or shearing straight out of a crack like they can out of one lined with ice or calcite. Of course I\'m still developing my feel for this type of sandstone . . .&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"http://lh6.ggpht.com/-5lzz2DKFsxI/UK62eHALEpI/AAAAAAABieI/18eCBLE8D5k/s2000/2012-11-13%252520-%25252006%252520-%252520100%252520Yard%252520Wall%252520-%252520Chinese%252520Eyes%252520-%252520Leading%252520-%252520by%252520Dirk%252520Summers.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"http://lh6.ggpht.com/-5lzz2DKFsxI/UK62eHALEpI/AAAAAAABieI/18eCBLE8D5k/s800/2012-11-13%252520-%25252006%252520-%252520100%252520Yard%252520Wall%252520-%252520Chinese%252520Eyes%252520-%252520Leading%252520-%252520by%252520Dirk%252520Summers.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Leading Chinese Eyes.

The crack takes a #4.5 BD Camalot the entire way. SuperTopo recommends bringing 2, with one to leave partway up as a backup, and the other to push to the top. We brought 1 #4.5 Camalot and 1 new #5 C4 Camalot. I was a wuss and pushed both along with me to the top! (I\'m still not trusty of the sandy crack, and I can still see myself kicking a cam out if I fell).

I went to the top of the Right Penguin to belay as per the SuperTopo recommendation, but there is nothing over there for an anchor and I was not about to belay from there without one! Still, getting to the Center Penguin is not trivial. With your last piece far below you have to step across to place a small piece, then make some sandy 5.8 face moves up to the chains and top of the formation.

Neither of us had enough time to do our Timp ridgeline &amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#152;project&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153; that weekend, but the Everest Ridge (aka. Big Baldy Ridge) on the west side of Mt Timpanogos seemed perfect for a single day climb.       &lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Since New Years eve the mountains had seen sustained high winds from the west, a recent thaw, and currently, an inversion with nighttime temperatures below freezing. This, I reasoned, would result in a hardened snowpack with a frozen crust on the western and southern slopes along that ridge, making for a perfect snow climb. Such conditions would also make our plan of climbing 6,560 ft in a day during the middle of winter feasible.   &lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;We had planned on meeting at Joe&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;s house at 1:00 am, but a Sundance movie that I was attending ran later than expected.  This left me no time to sleep and no real dinner, both of which became problematic later. Luckily I wasn&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;t seriously late and we were soon on our way to Utah (Happy) Valley.   &lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;My attempt to make up for lost time on the drive was hampered by the weather. A thick fogbank had rolled into the Salt Lake and Utah Valleys.  Although I had to slow down, we were lucky enough to find our way to the trailhead with only one missed turn and a run-in with some deer wandering the foggy hillside suburbs of Orem. We didn&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;t know what to expect at the trailhead due to all of the recent housing developments in the area, but luckily it was easy to find and had a good parking lot.   &lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;The fog/smog created by the inversion ended just below the trailhead, leaving us with a crystal clear night sky and a full moon to enjoy.  The metropolitan region below us was nowhere to be seen.  &lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;h2&gt;\r\n&lt;a name=\"TOC-2:20-am:\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;2:20 am:&lt;/h2&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;With our 30lb daypacks strapped on, we headed up a rough trail that soon dumped us into the riverbed of Dry Canyon.  For a while the trail was clear and easy to follow, but soon the rocks encountered became larger and the brush began to close in.  Joe and I suspected something was wrong but we pressed on ahead anyways since our speed still seemed reasonably fast.  After a while I began to get fed up with our &amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#152;trail&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153; and decided that we must have lost the real trail and that it was probably on the northern end of the canyon above the creek.  I kept a sharp lookout on that end of the creek and soon I saw a wall of boards on the slope above.  That was either the trail or a pipeline &amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#147; either way, better check it out.    &lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;It was the trail!  Free of rocks, level, and clear of vegetation, this highway allowed us to make significantly better progress up the canyon. Soon we reached a clear meadow. The moonlit form of Timpanogos loomed above us, while the lights of Utah Valley shown below. The clouds obscured most of the detail, making the city lights appear as surreal colored clusters of glowing orbs in the clouds below.  A string of orbs was probably I-15, but beyond that there were no recognizable signs that the surreal night landscape below us was a city.   &lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;The trail soon left the meadow and continued along the steep southern slopes of Mt Baldy. We soon encountered some rock hard patches of snow. Luckily the trail was well traveled and there was a cluster of footprints showing us the way to go all the way to the Big Baldy saddle.  Once the trail got into some deeper brush the snow softened (probably due to it receiving less sunlight) and we had to break out our snowshoes.  The trail turned north and steepened considerably. Soon we reached the border of a clearing allowing an uninterrupted view of the snow slopes rising over 3,000 feet straight up above us. The entire length of Everest Ridge was in full view, and the sight of such a long, open, and continuously steep ridge was at the same time intimidating and exhilarating.    &lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Rather than follow the edge of the clearing the rest of the way to the Big Baldy saddle, Joe and I cut across the open slopes and followed a faint ridge that became absorbed in the southern spur of Everest ridge.  The ridge provided some better views of the mountain, as well as some strange hiking over the large contoured cuts in the slope that are common in this part of the Wasatch Mountains.  Due to the overgrazing allowed by the earlier settlers, the hillsides had to have giant contoured steps cut into them to mitigate erosion and to allow the vegetation to grow back.   &lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;h2&gt;\r\n&lt;a name=\"TOC-4:45-am:\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;4:45 am:&lt;/h2&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;We reached the base of Everest Ridge. We had come 3 miles and 3,000 vertical feet since the trailhead. Now we had 3,500 feet to gain in the last 1.5 miles before the summit.  &lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;The moonlight was so bright on the snow that we no longer needed our headlamps, so Joe and I stowed them and our snowshoes and got out our crampons and ice axes.  I headed up the steep headwall of the southern spur on the ridge.  At the steepest point I measured the slope with my inclinometer &amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#147; 50&lt;sup&gt;o&lt;/sup&gt;! Steeper than I had expected to find on the route, and also the steepest slope measured that day - I found the rest of the ridge to be between the 30&lt;sup&gt;o&lt;/sup&gt;-40&lt;sup&gt;o&lt;/sup&gt; range.  &lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;\r\n&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;table border=\"0\" width=\"200\"&gt;\r\n&lt;tbody&gt;\r\n&lt;tr&gt;\r\n&lt;td&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-paNx6jdKgcY/Tg7K8zZ25QI/AAAAAAAAOoE/3qy970LsTLA/s2000/Timp-Jan22-05-2Joe%26Arc.JPG\" style=\"text-align:-webkit-center\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"\" border=\"2\" src=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-paNx6jdKgcY/Tg7K8zZ25QI/AAAAAAAAOoE/3qy970LsTLA/s400/Timp-Jan22-05-2Joe%2526Arc.JPG\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Joe Bullough climbing up Everest Ridge.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;/td&gt;\r\n&lt;td&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-eiMq7563F8g/Tg7K-LA5eKI/AAAAAAAAOoM/KaJGDTl_N-0/s2000/Timp-Jan22-05-3Ridge%2526Step.JPG\" style=\"text-align:-webkit-center\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"\" border=\"2\" src=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-eiMq7563F8g/Tg7K-LA5eKI/AAAAAAAAOoM/KaJGDTl_N-0/s400/Timp-Jan22-05-3Ridge%2526Step.JPG\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&amp;Acirc;&amp;nbsp;Looking up at the \'step\' crux of the Everest Ridge at sunrise.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;/td&gt;\r\n&lt;/tr&gt;\r\n&lt;/tbody&gt;\r\n&lt;/table&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;The steep slope was sustained and the horizon continued to roll away from me as I climbed higher.  Mt Baldy soon fell far below us. Our calves burned from the strain &amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#147; in order to save our legs we alternated between different foot positions, a little &lt;i&gt;pied troiseme&lt;/i&gt; (Three-o&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;clock) here, some French technique on diagonal lines there, and a lot of duck walking with French technique.  &lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;After about an hour and a half we reached our first cliff band.  Rather than leave the ridge to traverse around it, we searched for a way that we could climb up it with our crampons on.  Joe found a nice line a little to the south of the main ridge.  A small rock spire jutted out from the cliff, which provided an excellent stepping stone for getting up the cliff. The rock was mostly solid and very blocky.  There were many small ledges, but almost everything was normal to the cliff or sloped slightly downward. This made the final move onto the snow-covered talus a little awkward with the mantle moves. Overall it was a fun 20 ft section of mixed scrambling to break up the monotony of the snowclimb.  &lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;h2&gt;\r\n&lt;a name=\"TOC-7:30-am:\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;7:30 am:&lt;/h2&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;\r\n\r\nThe sky was beginning to lighten up &amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#147; the sun was finally rising!  We scrambled over some rock blocks jutting out of the snow and climbed to the top of a small rise, and from there we could see the remainder of the ridge.    &lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;table border=\"0\" width=\"200\"&gt;\r\n&lt;tbody&gt;\r\n&lt;tr&gt;\r\n&lt;td&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-_EVTSyMUBVQ/Tg7LMmVc2qI/AAAAAAAAOps/xzNq7Dpdoz8/s2000/Timp-Jan22-05-14Sunrise.jpg\" style=\"text-align:-webkit-center\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"\" border=\"2\" src=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-_EVTSyMUBVQ/Tg7LMmVc2qI/AAAAAAAAOps/xzNq7Dpdoz8/s400/Timp-Jan22-05-14Sunrise.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Looking south towards Cascade Peak at sunrise on Everest Ridge.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;/td&gt;\r\n&lt;td&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-CbDqHBuhMms/Tg7LLcTvpJI/AAAAAAAAOpk/zYem5uN-Ntg/s2000/Timp-Jan22-05-13StepCloseup.jpg\" style=\"text-align:-webkit-center\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"\" border=\"2\" src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-CbDqHBuhMms/Tg7LLcTvpJI/AAAAAAAAOpk/zYem5uN-Ntg/s400/Timp-Jan22-05-13StepCloseup.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Looking up at the \'step\' crux of the Everest Ridge.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;/td&gt;\r\n&lt;/tr&gt;\r\n&lt;/tbody&gt;\r\n&lt;/table&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Joe is rather like me in that we both love to take photos of our climbs, and with the sun beginning to rise we whipped out our cameras and in vain began snapping away. The light was still to faint for our digital cameras to capture much, especially since they wouldn&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;t let us take timed exposures.  Luckily I got a couple to come out crisp by using my ice axe as a tripod. A gorgeously sculpted bowl of snow stretched out before us, its sinuous crest leading the way up the final headwall before a short flat section and then the crux of the route, known as the &amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#152;step&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;.  The step is a large cliff band, perhaps some 100 ft thick that extends several hundred feet north and south of the ridgeline before retreating into the slopes of Timpanogos.  This crux in normally bypassed by traversing around to the south, and this is where our problems began.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Traversing north or south required traversing on a slope that passed between the &amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#152;step&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153; and another set of large cliffs below. The space between the cliffs was angled back at about 40 degrees and was some 100 ft wide &amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#147; a bad place to be caught in an avalanche.  The current cycle of avalanches were comprised of wet slides on southern aspects, and the avalanche danger rose as the snow became heated.  Because of this I was wary of following the standard traverse along the south slope of the ridge, since we would have to come back across this slope later in the day.  I could see the debris of a number of wet slides on the southern aspects surrounding us. Warning bells were going off in my head. The north facing slopes looked OK, there were no slides that I could see breaking off of them &amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#147; let&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;s take the northern traverse.  Joe was more wary of traversing north than south &amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#147; he was predominantly concerned with the dry slides that are more common in Utah, which break off of the northern and eastern aspects.  &lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-DJbVxtrQCH8/UHpCUP8GjDI/AAAAAAABaNk/jopRlHBo9Tc/s2000/IMG_3496%2520-%2520Joe%2520Bullough.JPG\" style=\"text-align:-webkit-center\"&gt;&lt;img border=\"2\" src=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-DJbVxtrQCH8/UHpCUP8GjDI/AAAAAAABaNk/jopRlHBo9Tc/s700/IMG_3496%2520-%2520Joe%2520Bullough.JPG\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Sunrise from the Everest Ridge route. (by Joe Bullough)&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;I gave in and tried the southern traverse.  I made it out about 50 feet before I turned back &amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#147; the snow was very hard, making it very slow and difficult to kick steps. Then I came to an ice sheet just as the slope steepened.  I front-pointed partway out on it and then came back. I would have been fine if I had had two ice axes, but since I only had one mountaineering ice axe, I had to balance on my toes when I re-set my axe. I doubted that I could self arrest on this +40&lt;sup&gt;o&lt;/sup&gt; slope before I went over the cliffs below me and I was aware that the ice sheet I was on was a thin sun crust. What if the crust broke underneath one of my crampons as the sun heated it?  &lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-qDCJbY27vXk/UHpCTUbI1VI/AAAAAAABaNU/Wm-DvqG-Al4/s2000/IMG_3494%2520-%2520Joe%2520Bullough.JPG\" style=\"text-align:-webkit-center\"&gt;&lt;img border=\"2\" src=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-qDCJbY27vXk/UHpCTUbI1VI/AAAAAAABaNU/Wm-DvqG-Al4/s700/IMG_3494%2520-%2520Joe%2520Bullough.JPG\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Begining the traverse below \"the Step\". (by Joe Bullough)&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Defeated, I came back to the ridge. Joe was still resistant to traversing to the north, so we compromised by going up a sliver of snow that cut straight up the cliffs. I had been checking out that sliver as a possible route from lower down on the ridge, and it looked feasible, apart from it ending about 15-20 feet short of the top of the cliffs. The first section involved ascending a steep section of snow bordering a 20 ft band of cliffs. I front pointed with my left foot while climbing on the rock to my right &amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#147; one foot on rock, the other on snow.  A short ascending traverse through mixed snow and rock brought me to the final cliff. It was encrusted in a thick coating of rime. I hacked away at the rime for about 10 minutes. By then I had uncovered enough hand and footholds to climb partway up the cliffs and find a good handhold. I hung there and hacked away at the remaining rime for another good while.&amp;Acirc;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Eventually the rock was completely free of rime and my arms were pumped.  I climbed up a bit higher and  could touch the snow above the cliffs. I had made it!  I searched around for a good solid handhold to cling to while I replaced my crampon points and stood up, but all I could find were small flat and sloping blocks with a dusting of snow. The snow above the cliffs was steep and powdering, covering loose scree.  Then I made a mistake &amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#147; I looked down. If my hands slipped on the awkward mantle moves required I would free fall about 15 feet and land on the steep hard packed snow below and take off like a rocket for the first 60 feet before flying over another 20 foot cliff band, and then another 100 feet before I went off the big cliff below.  I lost my stomach for making the final move and came back down.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-SzvrXO1gbAw/Tg7LT3jzW0I/AAAAAAAAOqU/yLHKC43fJlI/s2000/Timp-Jan22-05-18Step.jpg\" style=\"text-align:-webkit-center\"&gt;&lt;img border=\"2\" src=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-SzvrXO1gbAw/Tg7LT3jzW0I/AAAAAAAAOqU/yLHKC43fJlI/s700/Timp-Jan22-05-18Step.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;The \'step\' crux of Everest Ridge, seen from the SW as we descended.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;h2&gt;\r\n&lt;a name=\"TOC-9:00-am:\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;9:00 am:&lt;/h2&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;\r\n\r\nFor the past half hour or so I was feeling some vertigo and fatigue, probably a combination of sleep deprivation, lack of food (we had hardly stopped to eat that day, which didn&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;t help me since I hadn&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;t had much of a dinner the night before), and dehydration (since our camelbacks froze and we didn&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;t stop for water breaks to compensate). My drive had been adversely affected, but so had my thinking.  Joe was worried about the possibility of a dry avalanche on the north traverse. The stability of the snow pack for such a slide could easily be ascertained by digging a simple snowpit!  Why hadn&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;t I thought of that earlier!  I dug a pit and found a weak layer about 4 inches down. I tested the layer for shear and it refused to give. The layer was stable and the snow was likely to be safe.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;h2&gt;\r\n&lt;a name=\"TOC-10:00-am:\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;10:00 am:&lt;/h2&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;For some reason we didn&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;t continue on. My hands were numb and stinging very badly, so I tried to warm them.  I felt depleted of energy to push on the summit and drifted in and out of sleep as we moped around the &amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#152;step&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153; deciding whether or not to continue.

The Salt Lake metropolitan area was still nowhere to be seen, hidden by the murky clouds below.

We hadn&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;t taken any on our way up since it was still dark, so now was the time to make up for that.  We found a lot of great shots and poses. I also had some fun practicing some self arrests on the steep slopes, throwing myself flat on my back headfirst down the slope.  The snow had softened up and we had some good long glissades down the ridge and soon reached the Big Baldy Saddle. From there we headed down to the trailhead and reached the car by 1:30 pm.  &lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;table border=\"0\" width=\"200\"&gt;\r\n&lt;tbody&gt;\r\n&lt;tr&gt;\r\n&lt;td&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-GaBhRVppVo8/Tg7Lducjc-I/AAAAAAAAOrM/w7guSVOlcYM/s2000/Timp-Jan22-05-25JoeAboveTheClouds.jpg\" style=\"text-align:-webkit-center\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"\" border=\"2\" src=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-GaBhRVppVo8/Tg7Lducjc-I/AAAAAAAAOrM/w7guSVOlcYM/s400/Timp-Jan22-05-25JoeAboveTheClouds.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Joe Bullough enjoying a nice day, high above the smog-inundated Utah Valley.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;/td&gt;\r\n&lt;td&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-XYjBcqwLrus/Tg7LWxQRHsI/AAAAAAAAOqk/vWN29H1_vys/s2000/Timp-Jan22-05-20JoeRidge.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"\" border=\"2\" src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-XYjBcqwLrus/Tg7LWxQRHsI/AAAAAAAAOqk/vWN29H1_vys/s400/Timp-Jan22-05-20JoeRidge.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;/td&gt;\r\n&lt;/tr&gt;\r\n&lt;/tbody&gt;\r\n&lt;/table&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;table border=\"0\" width=\"200\"&gt;\r\n&lt;tbody&gt;\r\n&lt;tr&gt;\r\n&lt;td&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-MOUvCwwuXuE/UHpCevlEyXI/AAAAAAABaP8/8cOw8SLqqPc/s2000/IMG_3524%2520-%2520Joe%2520Bullough.JPG\" style=\"text-align:-webkit-center\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"\" border=\"2\" src=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-MOUvCwwuXuE/UHpCevlEyXI/AAAAAAABaP8/8cOw8SLqqPc/s400/IMG_3524%2520-%2520Joe%2520Bullough.JPG\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Boot glissading down Everest Ridge of Mt Timpanogos.

Just like two weeks prior I was late because of a movie, and just like two weeks prior, Joe had gotten some sleep while I hadn&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;t. Luckily I had had a good dinner the night before and bad weather was forecast for Saturday (compared to the good weather forecast last time), so at least our second attempt at climbing Everest Ridge on Mt Timpanogos wouldn&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;t start out &lt;i&gt;exactly&lt;/i&gt; the same as &lt;a href=\"http://www.markpthomas.com/mountaineering/trip-reports/utah/a-failed-attempt-of-everest-ridge-on-mt-timpanogos\"&gt;last time&lt;/a&gt;. Also, Glenn Merrill, a new member on Summitpost, would be meeting us at the trailhead. He had mentioned that he hadn&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;t been hiking much lately, but we figured it would still be nice to have some more company.    &lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;h2&gt;\r\n&lt;a name=\"TOC-2:00-am:\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;2:00 am:&lt;/h2&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;We had agreed to meet Glenn at the Dry Canyon trailhead at 1:30, but he was late and didn&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;t arrive until 1:45, so in futile retribution I drank his share of the coffee that I had brought along.  Joe and I weren&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;t sure if he was Mormon, so we weren&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;t sure if he would care, but it was a nice extra boost anyway.  The weather forecast called for cloudy skies and a 20-30% chance for snow &amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#147; with me taking the role of the optimist and Joe assuming that of the pessimist, our expectations balanced out nicely.  Also, recent avalanche activity was mimicking that of a spring cycle, with wet slides being the main foe, with the higher dangers now on the southern and southwestern aspects.  Since our last attempt, the Wasatch had seen another light snowstorm so there was a chance that we wouldn&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;t have the perfect snowpack like we did last time.  The inversion over the Wasatch Front had broken, so this time we could see the city lights below, which stood in wonderfully for lighting the snow slopes on Mt Timpanogos since our  full moon was now long gone.     &lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Joe and I took off strong from the trailhead, making sure to start out on the trail this time and not repeat our prior mistake of rushing up the creek instead.  Glenn kept up with us for the first few minutes, but eventually he fell further behind. We waited for him to catch up and then tried hiking at a slower pace, but he fell behind again. The next time he caught up I suggested that he hike in the middle to keep us reasonably together, but soon that fell apart.  Joe and I quickly crossed the meadow, me shaking my head disapprovingly at the burning campfire that some campers had left burning in the clearing.      &lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#156;Maybe I should pee it out, and punish them with the smell,&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#157; I suggested. Joe wasn&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;t as enthusiastic about the idea, so I kept on hiking.     &lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Once we had hiked through enough of the shaded parts of the trail to see that there would likely be no soft snow below the Big Baldy saddle, we agreed to cache our snowshoes and poles in the trees and pick them up on our way down.  Glenn caught up and did the same, and I marked the turnoff from the trail with an evil smiley-face carved in the snow while Joe took the GPS coordinates.      &lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;This time I was more insistent on Glenn hiking in front to set the pace, but he declined - he said that he didn&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;t want to mess up our summit attempt by making us go at a slower pace.  Although this was very noble of him, I still wanted us to be reasonably close and meet up at the Big Baldy saddle. I didn&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;t think Glenn&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;s pace would be that detrimental to our efforts since Joe and I had been hiking a little faster than last time, and Glenn wasn&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;t taking too long to catch up. Ultimately Joe and I took the lead but decided to wait for Glenn at the Big Baldy saddle. That was the last time we saw Glenn.    &lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;h2&gt;\r\n&lt;a name=\"TOC-4:30-am:\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;4:30 am:&lt;/h2&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;We reached the Big Baldy saddle a little earlier than last time, but it had taken us longer than last time. No worries &amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#147; we both felt refreshed and alert, and the sky was completely clear of clouds. Besides running a little slow everything was going well.  We had cut across the final clearing again and headed up the south ridge spur. As we neared the saddle I noticed a bright light towards where we were headed. Someone was camping at the saddle!  It looked like we would have some company (and competition?) on the route today.  These well-rested fellows donned their ice axes and crampons and headed out of camp about 15 minutes before we reached their point &amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#147; if this were to be a competition then Joe and I started out with a handicap.     &lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Our foes took the north spur, and since Joe and I were familiar with the southern spur, we followed pursuit. Joe and I had waited at several points in the clearing to wait for Glenn, but there was no sign of him. He had been hiking his headlamp turned off earlier, so we expected it to be difficult to spot him from far off. Joe expected me to be able to catch up to him, so I waited another 10 minutes while Joe shot up the ridge. Reluctantly I gave up hope of having Glenn join us on the upper slopes of Timp and headed towards the first set of cliffs.     &lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;This headwall was definitely steeper than that of the southern spur. I didn&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;t check with my inclinometer, but since the south spur rose up to 50&lt;sup&gt;o&lt;/sup&gt;, I figured this slope reached 55&lt;sup&gt;o&lt;/sup&gt;-60&lt;sup&gt;o&lt;/sup&gt;. I passed between the cliffs on a narrow tongue of snow and raced up the ridge.  Joe was far ahead and I slowly gained ground. Eventually my legs began to tire, probably as a result of me giving them a good workout earlier in the week, and I had to stop.  I had to stop and catch my breath or hack out some phlegm a few times, so my efforts to catch up failed.  Our foes traversed around the first major cliff band while Joe and I easily found our route up the rock that we took last time.    &lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;h2&gt;\r\n&lt;a name=\"TOC-7:00-am:\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;7:00 am:&lt;/h2&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Joe waited for me at the base of the &amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#152;step&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;, the crux of the route and our highpoint from two weeks earlier.  He had passed the slower of our two foes and had had a chat. The leader had climbed the route a few times before, but never directly up the buttress of the &amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#152;step&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;, and they were taking the southern traverse.  I arrived just after they started the traverse, and Joe was eager to get moving.  His hands were really cold and he didn&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;t want to wait around.  I resisted, sat down, and ate my first bit of food since dinner the night before.  Since the snow was softer than last time, with the more recent snow forming a lighter 2-6&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#157; deep wind slab on top of the old sun crust, I suggested that he keep warm by breaking trail up to the base of the final cliff that had defeated me. This time I brought a harness and 30 ft of webbing and some extra ice axes so that we could protect the final wall of the buttress, so I figured that Joe could keep warm and have the anchor set up by the time I caught up.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-VLxWO656HX0/TjEE4lT1P_I/AAAAAAAAhVw/Wv_NUqiY3Yw/s2000/Timp-Feb5-05-35StepSkiTracks%2526PointSlide.jpg\" style=\"text-align:-webkit-center\"&gt;&lt;img border=\"2\" src=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-VLxWO656HX0/TjEE4lT1P_I/AAAAAAAAhVw/Wv_NUqiY3Yw/s800/Timp-Feb5-05-35StepSkiTracks%2526PointSlide.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;The buttress of the\'step\' crux on Everest Ridge, seen from a distance. Notice the large point-slide that released along the bypassing traverse, overrunning the ski tracks.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;I pushed on a few minutes later and was pummeled by the loose snow chunks that Joe was knocking down the slope. I waited beneath some rock on the side until the barrage moved farther north and then headed up the thin tongue of snow. I was familiar with the moves on the snow and rock and made it up to the final wall easily, but Joe wasn&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;t there!  The sun still hadn\'t risen and I was climbing by headlamp, so I shined my light around to see if he had turned his off. Then I heard him -he was on top!  Apparently his cold hands gave him motivation to just get the climbing over with rather than wasting time on an anchor.  He offered to belay me from above, but I declined. Surely if he made it the final move must be fine. Besides, since it was still dark, the only light being that of the city below, it would be easier to ignore the exposure and concentrate on the rock.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;&lt;table border=\"0\" width=\"200\"&gt;\r\n&lt;tbody&gt;\r\n&lt;tr&gt;\r\n&lt;td&gt;&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-dztdpAQ6KVY/TjEEwyyJEGI/AAAAAAAAhVY/_si7BWnVa-g/s2000/Timp-Feb5-05-29TheStepRoute.jpg\" style=\"text-align:-webkit-center\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"\" border=\"2\" src=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-dztdpAQ6KVY/TjEEwyyJEGI/AAAAAAAAhVY/_si7BWnVa-g/s400/Timp-Feb5-05-29TheStepRoute.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;The buttress of the\'step\' crux on Everest Ridge, and our route through it.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\r\n&lt;td&gt;&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-MRxTxAob_gc/TjEEmQ8cRuI/AAAAAAAAhVE/KEoJH0b6D2Q/s2000/Timp-Feb5-05-26TheStepRoute.jpg\" style=\"text-align:-webkit-center\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"\" border=\"2\" src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-MRxTxAob_gc/TjEEmQ8cRuI/AAAAAAAAhVE/KEoJH0b6D2Q/s400/Timp-Feb5-05-26TheStepRoute.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\r\n&lt;/tr&gt;\r\n&lt;/tbody&gt;\r\n&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;The final move was doable, but it certainly wasn&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;t easy.  I could tell that the added dexterity from taking off my snow gloves wouldn&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;t help since there were no holds that I could cling to &amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#147; there were only small, blocky, snow-covered ledges.  My head was soon above the rock, but there was nothing to pull on to get onto the snow-covered scree.  I placed the back of my palms on the &amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#152;handholds&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;, with my fingers facing out, and lifted myself and my crampons off the rock. This was the only way I could keep balanced with the steep cliff and lean over the lip in order to grab anything higher up. Balancing on both arms, I shifted my crampons to some slightly higher toe holds to my right, stood up a little, and then repeated the same mantle move a little further over. Then I spread my right leg out onto a corner and used it to give myself the final push above the lip of the cliff while burrowing into the thin snow with my ice axe and forearms.       &lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;&lt;table border=\"0\" width=\"200\"&gt;\r\n&lt;tbody&gt;\r\n&lt;tr&gt;\r\n&lt;td&gt;&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-GyPfsyv0j-k/TjEEadWQyAI/AAAAAAAAhUk/ygClsBloSdY/s2000/Timp-Feb5-05-21SummitRidge%2526Summit.jpg\" style=\"text-align:-webkit-center\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"\" border=\"2\" src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-GyPfsyv0j-k/TjEEadWQyAI/AAAAAAAAhUk/ygClsBloSdY/s400/Timp-Feb5-05-21SummitRidge%2526Summit.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;The remaining summit ridge to be climbed, seen from where one tops out from Everest Ridge.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\r\n&lt;td&gt;&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-rYjJGffw9iQ/UO0Ak-YOAoI/AAAAAAABoDo/TKns7qqgodg/s2000/88504.jpg\" style=\"text-align:-webkit-center\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"\" border=\"2\" src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-rYjJGffw9iQ/UO0Ak-YOAoI/AAAAAAABoDo/TKns7qqgodg/s400/88504.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Sunrise on the Timpanogos summit ridge.&amp;Acirc;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;(by Joe Bullough)&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\r\n&lt;/tr&gt;\r\n&lt;/tbody&gt;\r\n&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;It was an easy walk the rest of the way to the massif ridgeline, and soon we could see all that remained of the route.  The sun was just barely rising too, so we whipped out our cameras.  The cold 5 mph wind that had chilled us lower down was now howling at around 30 mph, and my numb face couldn\'t take it any more. I strapped on my face mask and plodded along through the snow. The \'hard\' snow was just a soft wind slab, surprisingly soft for being on a wind-scoured west facing slope.

Joe and I had hoped to get a password written inside needed to claim an \"I Topped Timp\" pin from a bike shope in Orem, but alas, we couldn\'t get it. I took this photo as proof of summitting, but without the shop\'s address (also written inside), we couldn\'t find the place since I had last been there nearly 2 years ago.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\r\n&lt;td&gt;&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-22ow-WopFVA/TjEEGHiXfzI/AAAAAAAAhTg/62zaugqYR5c/s2000/Timp-Feb5-05-9NWfromSummitRoute.jpg\" style=\"text-align:-webkit-center\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"\" border=\"2\" src=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-22ow-WopFVA/TjEEGHiXfzI/AAAAAAAAhTg/62zaugqYR5c/s240/Timp-Feb5-05-9NWfromSummitRoute.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;The one would need to take to continue further along the ridge if attempting a massif traverse.

Still, we had summitted earlier than expected. Then my hopes were dashed and I nearly gave into despair &amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#147; the summit shelter was filled with snow!  I knew that inside lay the address for a bike shop in Orem that gave out  &lt;big&gt;&lt;i&gt;pins&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/big&gt;  for climbing Mt Timpanogos, as well as the code needed to convince them that you &lt;i&gt;really&lt;/i&gt; made it!  Joe and I had really looked forward to being the first ones that year to claim the prize, but alas it didn&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;t look possible.  I took some photos of the shelter in hopes that this would convince the bike shop (we could never find it without the address though). By then the wind had cooled my hands to the point of searing pain, so Joe and I gladly fled the summit. A half hour later we were back at the top of the Everest Ridge route.     &lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-oRP772RkG2g/TjEEOpLCw_I/AAAAAAAAhUE/o18SX32zmgk/s2000/Timp-Feb5-05-12JoeRidgeWindowClose.jpg\" style=\"text-align:-webkit-center\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"\" border=\"2\" src=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-oRP772RkG2g/TjEEOpLCw_I/AAAAAAAAhUE/o18SX32zmgk/s800/Timp-Feb5-05-12JoeRidgeWindowClose.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Joe Bullough tempting fate high on Mt Timpanogos.

The slope was steep, reaching nearly 50o, and it provided some fun down climbing. The snow was varied, with mostly kick stepping and some occasional front-pointing.  The inch-thick sun crust proved to be troublesome by bursting out beneath one&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;s foot when weighting footsteps in the snow, immediately followed by the collapse of the step. This didn&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;t seem to happen with the deeper steps kicked directly into the hill, so I made new steps, down climbing backwards, in order to avoid the troublesome crust problems.     &lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;&lt;table border=\"0\" width=\"200\"&gt;\r\n&lt;tbody&gt;\r\n&lt;tr&gt;\r\n&lt;td&gt;&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-iWyhULM7poc/TjEEWgd0PxI/AAAAAAAAhUc/miT3YXuuLA8/s2000/Timp-Feb5-05-18MtNebo%2526UtahLake.jpg\" style=\"text-align:-webkit-center\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"\" border=\"2\" src=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-iWyhULM7poc/TjEEWgd0PxI/AAAAAAAAhUc/miT3YXuuLA8/s400/Timp-Feb5-05-18MtNebo%2526UtahLake.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Mt Nebo has a commanding presence above Utah Valley.

The prevalence of sun cups prevented us from glissading much, and during most of the descent it sounded like I was walking on potato chips.

Neither one of them responded to us much and they were spaced very far apart, just like when we had passed them on the massif ridgeline.

Apparently he couldn&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;t find it in the dark and left us a note at the car.  We brought it with us and were down at the trailhead in no time.  Joe and I were surprised &amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#147; it was only 12:15!  We had gone further than last time, yet we hadn&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;t been out as long. We had beaten our earlier time by a full half hour!     &lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;The forecasted snowstorm failed to materialize, leaving us a beautiful clear day. We dropped Glenn&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;s gear off at his house, looked in vain for the Orem bike shop, and headed home. To top off the successful outing I went on to stuff myself at an all-you-can-eat buffet in downtown Salt Lake City and went to sleep by 4:00 pm &amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#147; God it\'s nice having Salt Lake City so close to these big mountains.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-J5MUAdUOlx0/TjEFI44ERJI/AAAAAAAAhWU/o9JLNpcuDag/s2000/Timp-Feb5-05-41TimpFromDryCanyon.jpg\" style=\"text-align:-webkit-center\"&gt;&lt;img border=\"2\" src=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-J5MUAdUOlx0/TjEFI44ERJI/AAAAAAAAhWU/o9JLNpcuDag/s800/Timp-Feb5-05-41TimpFromDryCanyon.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;From the mouth of Dry Canyon one only gets fleeting glimpses of the massive W Face of Mt Timpanogos.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;hr&gt;\r\n&lt;hr&gt;\r\n&lt;h2&gt;\r\n&lt;a name=\"TOC-Links\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Links&lt;/h2&gt;\r\n&lt;ul&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://picasaweb.google.com/105894936663116565516/20050205EverestRidgeMtTimpanogos?authuser=0&amp;amp;feat=directlink\"&gt;Picasa Album&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://www.summitpost.org/climbing-everest-ridge-on-mt-timpanogos/169851\"&gt;SummitPost TR&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;/ul&gt;\r\n&lt;/div&gt; \r\n'),(45,199,'/mountaineering/trip-reports/utah/geocache---hiking-storm-mountain','Storm Mtn (W Ridge)','Geocache - Hiking Storm Mountain','Trip_Report','content: &lt;div dir=\"ltr\"&gt;\r\n&lt;h1&gt;\r\n&lt;a name=\"TOC-Geocache---Hiking-Storm-Mountain\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Geocache - Hiking Storm Mountain&lt;/h1&gt;\r\n&lt;hr&gt;\r\n&lt;hr&gt;\r\n&lt;table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"2\" cellspacing=\"1\"&gt;\r\n&lt;tbody&gt;\r\n&lt;tr&gt;\r\n&lt;td&gt;\r\n&lt;font color=\"BLUE\"&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;b&gt;Stats&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/font&gt;\r\n&lt;ul&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;Route:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href=\"http://www.summitpost.org/show/route_link.pl/route_id/3440/object_id/3238\"&gt;Ferguson Canyon, W Ridge&lt;/a&gt;\r\n&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;Elevation Gained:&lt;/b&gt; 4,324 ft  \r\n&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;Distance:&lt;/b&gt; 3.5 miles (7.3 miles RT)  \r\n&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;RT Time:&lt;/b&gt; 4 hrs 55min (strenuous)  \r\n&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt; Trailhead:&lt;/b&gt; Ferguson Canyon  \r\n&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;TH Elevation:&lt;/b&gt; 5,250\'  \r\n&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;Summit Elev.:&lt;/b&gt; 9,524\'  \r\n&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;Rating:&lt;/b&gt; II Class 3-  \r\n&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;Climbers:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href=\"http://www.summitpost.org/mountains/user_link.pl?user_id=13451\"&gt;Mark Thomas&lt;/a&gt;\r\n&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;/ul&gt;\r\n&lt;/td&gt;\r\n&lt;td align=\"right\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-w_ULsHwkZvI/Tg6hn_iovZI/AAAAAAAALjw/dJf3G_TTW0Q/s2000/Storm%2520Mountain.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img height=\"200\" src=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-w_ULsHwkZvI/Tg6hn_iovZI/AAAAAAAALjw/dJf3G_TTW0Q/s800/Storm%2520Mountain.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\r\n&lt;/tr&gt;\r\n&lt;/tbody&gt;\r\n&lt;/table&gt;\r\n&lt;hr&gt;\r\n&lt;hr&gt;\r\n&lt;h2&gt;\r\n&lt;a name=\"TOC-June-6-2004\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;b&gt;June 6, 2004&lt;/b&gt;\r\n&lt;/h2&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;Ascent Route:&lt;/b&gt; Ferguson Canyon &amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#147; West Ridge&amp;Acirc;&amp;nbsp;\r\n&lt;div&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;Descent Route:&lt;/b&gt; unnamed &amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#152;poop chute&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153; &amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#147; Ferguson Canyon      \r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\nStorm Mountain was another major Wasatch peak that I had wanted to do for a while, and on Sunday, June 6th, I set out to bag it. I couldn&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;t find anyone else interested in climbing it, so I set out alone, leaving my car at 8am. Typical of most Wasatch western approaches, I started out in a Salt Lake City suburb, but quickly found myself isolated from the city. The trail began as a dirt road before fading into a series of branching and merging trails, all of which headed up the narrow mouth of Ferguson canyon. There are many striated granite cliffs here which are very popular for rock climbing, but this morning I was the only one in the canyon. The trail had started out very flat, the switchbacks to come were very flat, and the upper meadow was relatively flat, so most of the elevation gain was isolated into a few steep straight-a-ways on the trail, making it steeper than the average elevation gain would lead one to believe.&amp;Acirc;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;\r\n&lt;div&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;/div&gt;\r\n&lt;div&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-YZ-ApENjHj4/Tg6hkU4ezUI/AAAAAAAALjs/egCxHUaCzmU/s2000/StormMtn-June6-12UpperMeadow.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-YZ-ApENjHj4/Tg6hkU4ezUI/AAAAAAAALjs/egCxHUaCzmU/s800/StormMtn-June6-12UpperMeadow.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;First view of Storm Mountain\'s summit&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\nThe trail was hard to follow since there were so many other use-trails in the area, and the stream, full from spring runoff, filled in much of the main trail. I persisted, walking up a swamped trail, crossing rocks to the north side of the stream, to avoid some cliffs dropping directly into the stream. From there I hiked straight up a very steep hill, missed the next crossing, but forded the stream on some bushes and rocks a little ways farther up the canyon. I crossed to the north side of the stream again on a log and took my first 3 minute break.  I was resolved to rest for three minutes every half hour, and it was now 8:30 am.  A few minutes after my first break I encountered the switchbacks. These were very flat and I made good time on them.  I paid special care to avoid taking the branch to the lookout and found the switchback that continued up the canyon from the more commonly traveled trail. From here the trail became even more overgrown and never got much better - apparently not many people continue up Ferguson Canyon to hike Storm Mountain. After the final switchback I entered a meadow with a nice view of the surrounding canyon, which had begun to broaden as I ascended higher. There were still many scattered cliffs high above me on the ridgelines.   \r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-XNfK6Z3KoAU/Tg6hgF2lwlI/AAAAAAAALjc/vxpe6zi_uc0/s2000/StormMtn-June6-9RidgetoBFTwinPks.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-XNfK6Z3KoAU/Tg6hgF2lwlI/AAAAAAAALjc/vxpe6zi_uc0/s800/StormMtn-June6-9RidgetoBFTwinPks.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Robinson Ridge seen from the summit&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\nAs I hiked on I kept hearing popping sounds that I attributed to some construction project going on in the suburbs below &amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#147; now that I had line-of-site with the city I could begin to hear some of its sounds. I crossed the river to the south, and then to the north again. At one point I entered a clearing and some bushes ahead of me shook intensely and out fluttered a pheasant. I took a few minutes to snap some photos of it and let myself be amused by its silly clucking before continuing on.  \r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"7WildCatRidgeandMtRaymond.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-kWT_hTKZa6k/Tg6hd2ZDiLI/AAAAAAAALjU/F_-sdi5XDcQ/s800/StormMtn-June6-7WildCatRidgeandMtRaymond.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Wildcat Ridge seen from the summit&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\nI crossed the river to the south again and began to wind up along the north edge of a steep meadow. As I neared the cliffs above me the faint trail began to ease up on the abuse that the low branches were wreaking on my legs and I entered a dry stream bed. The trail continued straight up the steep stream bed with occasional detours onto the upper sides of the ditch before eventually topping out in a flat meadow above the cliffs on the south side of the canyon. From here I had my first glimpse of the cirque. It was close now and I knew that I would be at the base of the peak in a matter of minutes.  I walked to a joining meadow to the south before cutting through some pine trees and aspens to another meadow to the north. From here I continued cross country on a series of linked meadows along the base of the north slopes of the canyon. Occasionally I followed a faint use trail, but it disappeared often. While the standard route up the peak was to follow the meadows to the end of the cirque and scramble south on the ridge to the peak, I decided to take the alternate route listed by John Veranth in his &amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#156;Hiking the Wasatch&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#157; trail guide, which ascends the west ridge of the peak, on the north side of the canyon.   \r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-h5WN1fGttY4/Tg6hb7yBQlI/AAAAAAAALjM/hDJ3jkWMNsU/s2000/StormMtn-June6-5BigCottonwoodCanyon-summit.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-h5WN1fGttY4/Tg6hb7yBQlI/AAAAAAAALjM/hDJ3jkWMNsU/s800/StormMtn-June6-5BigCottonwoodCanyon-summit.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Mt. Olympus seen from the summit&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\nAs I neared the base of the peak, keeping close to the north side of the meadows, I saw a twisting chute gouged out of the rocky ridge. It has a lone tall pine tree in it and it appeared to be a good way to access the ridge with a minimum amount of light bush-wacking. The quartzite rocks in the chute were a little loose, but not too bad. Once I got above the pine tree I traversed west on some ledges to gain the ridge. From here it was a nice scramble to the summit. It was mostly class 2 with a few 15-25 ft class 3 walls, and there was only a little bit of brush that was in the way. There was never much exposure, but the views were incredible.  I could hear popping sounds again and this time I realized that it was not hammering at a construction site, but rather, gun shots. I could see a shooting range on a plateau above the mouth of Big Cottonwood canyon 4,000 feet below me. \r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\nI reached the summit at 10:30am and was surprised to find another summit register &amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#147; I had only seen registers on a few other Wasatch peaks. It turned out to be a geocache. These are registers left at hidden locations around the US as part of a nationwide treasure hunt &amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#147; people would load geocache coordinates from a website into a GPS unit and would hunt for them. The caches contained a register and some odd items &amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#147; people who found the caches were encouraged to take something from the cache and leave something behind. Inside the cache was a business card, a membership ID, a plastic Chihuahua form a fast food chain, some currency with Cyrillic writing on it (perhaps its Russian?), and a skier figure made out of soldered screws, a wing-nut, and other metal items.  I called my father from the summit on my cell phone, wrote in the register, had a snack, and took some of the coins from the register. I didn&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;t have much to give back, but I left 3 granola bars with my summit date attached for the next discoverers to eat.  \r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-7jUqSDobqp4/Tg6ha7k9HHI/AAAAAAAALjI/h4UM_bqG4CU/s2000/StormMtn-June6-4GeoCacheDude.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"\" src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-7jUqSDobqp4/Tg6ha7k9HHI/AAAAAAAALjI/h4UM_bqG4CU/s800/StormMtn-June6-4GeoCacheDude.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;One of the strange items that I found inside the Geocache at the summit&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n    \r\n    I had originally planned to do the mountaineering traverse along a narrow ridge and over several unnamed peaks to reach the Broad Fork Twin Peaks, but the snow was so sloppy that I decided to leave the route for when the snow had fully melted or the following spring. I left the summit at 11:20am and headed down the standard route, following a ridge heading south to a low point in the cirque headwall. I became fed up with the vegetation very quickly. Luckily I spotted a chute below me that seemed to go all the way down to the meadow, and I headed down it. The chute had a lot of loose rock, but it still seemed a more pleasant descent alternative for me. As I reached the meadow I met a party of 5 people heading up the meadow. They didn&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;t seem interested in doing the cleaner west ridge, so I gave them directions to the start of the standard route and continued down the trail.\r\n  &lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n    \r\n    \r\n    I descended at a fast pace, jogging at some points, moving my legs as fast as possible to keep up with all of the rocks and tree roots racing underneath me.  I sped past the groups of climbers who had since descended from the climbing areas at the mouth of the canyon and reached my car at 12:55 pm.\r\n    \r\n  &lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;hr&gt;\r\n&lt;hr&gt;\r\n&lt;h2&gt;\r\n&lt;a name=\"TOC-Links\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Links&lt;/h2&gt;\r\n&lt;ul&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://picasaweb.google.com/105894936663116565516/20040606StormMountain?authuser=0&amp;amp;feat=directlink\"&gt;Picasa Album&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://www.summitpost.org/geocache-hiking-storm-mountain/169435\"&gt;SummitPost TR&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;/ul&gt;\r\n&lt;/div&gt;\r\n&lt;/div&gt; \r\n'),(46,200,'/mountaineering/trip-reports/utah/lady-bug-summit---hiking-box-elder-s-ne-ridge','Box Elder Pk (NE Ridge)','Lady Bug Summit - Hiking Box Elder\'s NE Ridge','Trip_Report','content: &lt;div dir=\"ltr\"&gt;\r\n&lt;h1&gt;\r\n&lt;a name=\"TOC-Lady-Bug-Summit---Hiking-Box-Elder-s-NE-Ridge\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Lady Bug Summit - Hiking Box Elder\'s NE Ridge&lt;/h1&gt;\r\n&lt;hr&gt;\r\n&lt;hr&gt;\r\n&lt;table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"2\" cellspacing=\"1\"&gt;\r\n&lt;tbody&gt;\r\n&lt;tr&gt;\r\n&lt;td width=\"40%\"&gt;\r\n&lt;font color=\"BLUE\"&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;b&gt;Stats&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/font&gt;\r\n&lt;ul&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;Route:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href=\"http://www.summitpost.org/show/route_link.pl/route_id/2119/object_id/2274\"&gt;N Ridge via Deer Creek&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"http://www.summitpost.org/show/route_link.pl/route_id/4808/object_id/2274\"&gt;S Slopes via Dry Creek&lt;/a&gt;\r\n&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;Elevation Gained:&lt;/b&gt; 4,241 ft (5,591 ft loss)  \r\n&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;Distance:&lt;/b&gt; 4.5 miles (10 miles RT)  \r\n&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;RT Time:&lt;/b&gt; 8 hrs (relaxed)  \r\n&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt; Trailheads:&lt;/b&gt; Deer Creek, Dry Creek  \r\n&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;TH Elevations:&lt;/b&gt; 6,770\'  \r\n&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;Summit Elev.:&lt;/b&gt; 11,101&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;  \r\n&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;Rating:&lt;/b&gt; II Class 2, Moderate Snow  \r\n&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;Climbers:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href=\"http://www.summitpost.org/mountains/user_link.pl?user_id=13451\"&gt;Mark Thomas&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"http://www.summitpost.org/mountains/user_link.pl/user_id/14466\"&gt;Alan Stenquist&lt;/a&gt;\r\n&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;/ul&gt;\r\n&lt;/td&gt;\r\n&lt;td&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-_BdDLwAb4jo/Tg7DOZNRhoI/AAAAAAAAOLo/d9_FwtWRKkE/s2000/ThunderMtn-July10-04-25BoxElderPk%2526MtTimpanogos.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img height=\"250\" src=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-_BdDLwAb4jo/Tg7DOZNRhoI/AAAAAAAAOLo/d9_FwtWRKkE/s800/ThunderMtn-July10-04-25BoxElderPk%2526MtTimpanogos.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;/td&gt;\r\n&lt;/tr&gt;\r\n&lt;/tbody&gt;\r\n&lt;/table&gt;\r\n&lt;hr&gt;\r\n&lt;hr&gt;\r\n&lt;h2&gt;\r\n&lt;a name=\"TOC-June-3-2004\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;June 3, 2004&lt;/h2&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;Ascent Route:&lt;/b&gt;  Deer Creek Trail-Dry Creek Divide &amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#147; North Ridge\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;Descent Route:&lt;/b&gt; South Slopes &amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#147; Dry Creek Trail\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n   \r\n\r\nThe month of June had just begun and I just recently arrived in Salt Lake City to take a year off from attending UC Berkeley in order to save up more money to pay for my last year of college. I had spent my last few weeks in California squeezing in as many mountaineering trips as possible, and now that I was back in Salt Lake City, with the mountains so close, I was desperate to get out into the mountains.  Luckily, my friend Alan Stenquist was interested in doing a hike, and we planned to do something in the Wasatch Mountains the first Thursday that I was back in Utah.  \r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n   \r\n\r\nAfter pondering several options, Alan and I decided to hike Box Elder Peak &amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#147; it was one of the few major Wasatch Peaks that I had yet to summit, and it seemed like a nice trip to see how the spring snow conditions were in the Wasatch Range. By default we had originally planned to hike the north ridge. I wanted to approach it via the Dry Creek trail in Alpine, since it gained 3,950 feet to the Dry Creek divide, but Alan talked me into taking the easier Deer Creek trail, which began in American Fork canyon and only gained 2,700 feet to the divide. Since there was still 4,341 feet to be gained by taking that route, I was willing to take the easier route. After looking at a USGS topo for the area and some photos I had taken of the north side of Box Elder Peak from Lone Peak the previous June, I could pick out what looked to be a more exciting and unlisted route heading up the massive cirque on the north side, winding through several cliff bands. As we drove to the trailhead Thursday morning, I tried to convince Alan to do this more adventurous route, but he wouldn&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;t budge &amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#147; we would hike the north ridge from Dry Creek Divide, and I would return another day to try out my route. \r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n   \r\n\r\nAfter a straightforward &amp;Acirc;&amp;frac12; hour drive to the trailhead, we began hiking shortly after 7 am. We began at a fast pace, but slowed up after the first half hour. Alan kept falling behind because of some lingering knee pains and the vegetation in the canyon was affecting my asthma.  I also realized that we had all day to do this simple hike, and there was no need to hurry. We stopped occasionally to admire the views of the canyon and the north face of Mt Timpanogos.  The trail was well maintained and had a good amount of shade, but views were never obstructed.  \r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n   \r\n\r\nStrangely, the Dry Creek Divide was not the lowest point on the ridge at the end of the canyon, but was instead about &amp;Acirc;&amp;frac14; of a mile north and a few hundred feet higher. The trail switch-backed consistently to the east to avoid a large talus slope, and eventually crossed it near the top, just below some cliffs. The rocks here were piled in odd lumps that the trail wound around. As Alan and I wound around these piles of dirt, talus, and scree, I wondered if the slope debris was actually mine tailings rather than a result of natural erosion.  \r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n   \r\n\r\nSoon after crossing the debris field, Alan and I arrived at a beautiful flat meadow at the Dry Creek Divide. We had been hiking for about 2.5 hours and were a little hungry, so we stopped to eat some snacks and take a few photos of Mt Timpanogos.  From here the trail heading south to Box Elder Peak became very faint. It was obvious that few people hiked on this trail since little bits of vegetation were beginning to take root in the middle of the trail.  \r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n   \r\n\r\nThe headwall to the north ridge began at 9,400 feet and it still held a lot of snow. The lower part of the ridge offered a fun snow climb with a slope that undulated from as little as a 5&lt;sup&gt;o&lt;/sup&gt; incline to over 45&lt;sup&gt;o&lt;/sup&gt; within 20 feet of hiking. As we neared the top of the ridge, the snow became noticeably softer and soon we were post-holing with every step. Even though it was only a little after 10pm, the sun had already warmed the snow to a point were it was difficult to travel on it. I debated putting on my long pants and gaitors, but since the summit was so close I didn&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;t want to put them on for such a small distance. Since Alan had long pants on, I got him to break trail from this point to minimize the pain of snow crystals scraping my bare legs from post-holing.  \r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n   \r\n\r\nAlan and I arrived on the summit at about 11:30, 4.5 hours since leaving the trailhead. The rocks on the summit seemed to be covered with lots of read algae, but once we got closer we saw that the red color was actually thousands of Lady Bugs swarming over the rocks!   \r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n   \r\n\r\nThe summit was marked with a tall pole, and it contained a summit register. I was quite happy to see this since I&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;m unaccustomed to seeing registers on Wasatch Peaks, and I&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;ve enjoyed their presence on Sierra summits. The log had a lot of coarse language and bitching (more so than in the Sierra summit logs), especially from a Lithuanian who ended his message by stating that he hated everything. I was caught off guard by this since the summit overlooked the Provo metropolitan area, which was surely one of the most conservative cities in the United States &amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#147; I was quite amused. Keeping with the odd spirit of the summit log, my friend Alan ranted about how easy the peak was, and that he could have climbed it using a unicycle on a pogo stick. By the time we had eaten some food and signed the summit register I was ready to head down &amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#147; the lady bugs had begun to swarm all over my bare legs and they were beginning to tickle me.  \r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n   \r\n\r\nAlan and I decided to head down the south slopes and hike out the Dry Creek trail, and after securing a ride from his girlfriend, Alan and I took off down the west side of the mountain. It was mostly free of snow, suited us since it had become too soft to be enjoyable. Luckily there was a long snow sliver in a gully lower down, and it was just barely hard enough to glissade. Alan and I did a standing glissade for a few hundred feet, and by the time we got to the end of the snow, we were almost to the pack trail that circumvented the peak. It was faint but straightforward to follow back to the Dry Creek trail. A long, straight, steep trail led us down to Alpine. It didn&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;t have many opportunities for views, but near the bottom we spotted a gorgeous waterfall, perhaps 50 feet high and flowing strong.  \r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n   \r\n\r\nEventually we reached the mouth of the canyon and the beginnings of the latest urban sprawl developments. It had taken us about 2.5 hours to get down from the summit. After walking a short ways down the dirt road, Alan&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;s girlfriend, &amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#152;fish stick&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;, arrived, and she shuttled us back to our car at the Deer Creek trailhead. Overall the moderately strenuous hike was very pleasant, with wonderful views, with some very interesting geological features along the route.\r\n\r\n&lt;hr&gt;\r\n&lt;hr&gt;\r\n&lt;h2&gt;\r\n&lt;a name=\"TOC-Links\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Links&lt;/h2&gt;\r\n&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"http://www.summitpost.org/lady-bug-summit-hiking-box-elder-s-ne-ridge/169436\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://www.summitpost.org/lady-bug-summit-hiking-box-elder-s-ne-ridge/169436\"&gt;SummitPost TR&lt;/a&gt;\r\n&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;\r\n&lt;/div&gt; \r\n'),(47,201,'/mountaineering/trip-reports/utah/surviving-a-1-000-ft-fall-on-mt-nebo','Mt Nebo (Cedar Ridge Attempt) (Winter)','Surviving a 1,000 ft Fall on Mt Nebo','Trip_Report','content: &lt;div dir=\"ltr\"&gt;\r\n&lt;h1&gt;\r\n&lt;a name=\"TOC-Surviving-a-1-000-ft-Fall-on-Mt-Nebo\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Surviving a 1,000 ft Fall on Mt Nebo&lt;/h1&gt;\r\n&lt;h2&gt;\r\n&lt;a name=\"TOC-February-19-2005\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;February 19, 2005&lt;/h2&gt;\r\n&lt;hr&gt;\r\n&lt;hr&gt;\r\n&lt;table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"2\" cellspacing=\"1\"&gt;\r\n&lt;tbody&gt;\r\n&lt;tr&gt;\r\n&lt;td width=\"45%\"&gt;\r\n&lt;font color=\"BLUE\"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Stats&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/font&gt;\r\n&lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;Route:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href=\"http://www.summitpost.org/show/route_link.pl/route_id/2029/object_id/1443\"&gt;Cedar Ridge&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;Elevation Gained:&lt;/b&gt; TBA  &lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;RT Distance:&lt;/b&gt; TBA  &lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;RT Time:&lt;/b&gt; 2 Days  &lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;Trailhead:&lt;/b&gt; Willow Creek  &lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;TH Elevation:&lt;/b&gt; 5,695 ft  &lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;Elevation of Accident:&lt;/b&gt; ca. 11,100&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;  &lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;Rating:&lt;/b&gt; III, Moderate Snow  &lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;Climbers:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href=\"http://www.summitpost.org/mountains/user_link.pl?user_id=13451\"&gt;Mark Thomas&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"http://www.summitpost.org/cgi-bin/user_link.pl?user_id=16537\"&gt;Joe Bullough&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"http://www.summitpost.org/mountains/user_link.pl/user_name/bc44caesar\"&gt;Casey&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;/ul&gt;\r\n&lt;/td&gt;\r\n&lt;td width=\"55%\"&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-jj9zGRcWQCk/UOiFvCjSmRI/AAAAAAABn9k/MbEBTy9IAUY/s2000/91856.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img height=\"250\" src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-jj9zGRcWQCk/UOiFvCjSmRI/AAAAAAABn9k/MbEBTy9IAUY/s800/91856.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;/td&gt;\r\n&lt;/tr&gt;\r\n&lt;/tbody&gt;\r\n&lt;/table&gt;\r\n&lt;hr&gt;\r\n&lt;hr&gt;\r\n&lt;h2&gt;\r\n&lt;a name=\"TOC-Friday-February-18th\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Friday, February 18th&lt;/h2&gt;\r\nJoe and I pulled to a stop at the mouth of Willow Creek Canyon shortly after 6:45 pm. We had just reached the unmarked trailhead for that weekend&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;s outing: a winter ascent of Mt Nebo via Cedar Ridge.  Storms and high winds were moving in that weekend, with 1.5&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153; of snow forecasted for the mountains that night, but we had decided to go ahead with the trip anyway.  Nebo&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;s Cedar Ridge was heavily forested until the last 1,500 ft before the summit, and the route would be on a ridgeline the entire way, rarely reaching a steepness that would have one concerned about avalanches.  Because of the relative ease and safety of the route, we figured that it would be a safe route to do under the conditions, as long as we stayed on the route and avoided any questionable slopes.  \r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;  As Joe and I got our gear ready, Casey hopped out of his car to greet us.  Casey was a climber on Summitpost whom we had agreed to have along on the trip &amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#147; he was heading up to the Wasatch to do some skiing and climbing and had expressed interest on an online thread about climbing Nebo via Cedar Ridge.  After hearing about what sort of trips he had been on and reading about him in Scott Patterson&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;s latest trip report on their climb up CO&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;s Mt Massive, Joe and I welcomed the extra company.  &lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;  We went over the route on the topographic map together and then headed up the steep slopes of Mt Nebo.  We weren&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;t sure how far we were going to go up the mountain that night, but we had talked about camping either at 7,724&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153; or 9,000&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;. Casey had seen the mountain in the daylight before Joe and I had arrived and had noticed that there were a lot of cliffs barring access to the main ridge spur, so we headed up a side spur in hopes of regaining the ridge higher up.  &lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;  The detour turned out to be a mistake &amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#147; the clear terrain became brushy as we headed higher. Since Scott had reported on Summitpost that he never encountered much bushwhacking we suspected that we were off route, but continued on in hopes of regaining Cedar Ridge higher up. Joe began to express concerns about getting cliffed out as he reached a narrow point in the ridge. I looked down to the left and saw a large snowy clearing below that led to a long silvery tongue of snow that seemed to stretch from the valley all the way up to the camps we were hoping to reach. There was too much of a drop below to make descending to the flats safe, so I continued along the ridge to see if there was a better way to descend. Just as I reached a large cliff I saw that I could get down to the snow slopes below by down climbing some snow free rock just a short ways back from the cliff.  The landing looked good, sloping away from the cliff, so in case I fell or needed to jump I was safe from falling off.  &lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;  The scrambling was more difficult than expected &amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#147; the rock was very steep and sharp. It was also a little slick lower down since there was a little snow on it. I grabbed a large flake and lie-backed as I moved down. Once I reached the end of the flake I found some knobby rock to grip on the underside, but beyond that there were no more handholds.  I gripped the rock, lowered myself as far as I could, and failing to find any secure footholds, dropped the last 2 feet onto the snow slope. I called for the others to follow me down and then continued to break trail down the slope to a saddle joining Cedar Ridge to the spur that we were on.  &lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;  &amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#156;Oh my god!&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#157; Casey exclaimed once he reached the saddle. I had directed his attention back to where we had down climbed &amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#147; he hadn&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;t seen the cliff earlier. The highpoint of the ridge and the cliff on the back side was large enough that I was able to identify it on the topo map. Our route had taken us to the brink of a sheer drop off. After a brief water break we headed toward the snow tongue only to find that the tongue was an old avalanche debris field &amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#147; the snow was hard-packed and packed full of stones and snapped pine trees. The debris was very old and the current unstable slopes were on the north and east aspects at the time, rather than the south facing slope we were ascending, so I decided that a night-time ascent of the sliver was safe.   &lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;  The snow provided a fast easy way up the slope, since the rest of the hillside was covered with thick scrub oak.  Casey hadn&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;t expected such tough terrain on the first 3,000 feet of the route and had chosen to wear his lighter shoes at the time, and this made the going tough for him.  Since he knew that we were close to a camping place by then, he chose to take off through the scrub oak toward a hopefully clear ridge rather than changing into his stiffer boots.  Joe and I headed higher, taking occasional GPS readings as we ascended to keep track of our progress. Casey was tired from his long drive up from New Mexico and wanted to camp at the lowest camp, so we were going to have to leave the snowfield at some point to traverse over to the ridge.  &lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;  I was a little overzealous in making progress up the hill, and suddenly we were at 8,100 ft.  OOPS! Casey was too far away to hear us through the winds, so we bashed our way through the brush over to the ridge to explain the situation.  Joe and I regretfully informed him that we had passed the first camp, but then I tried to talk him into climbing higher. I really didn&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;t want to lose and regain 400 ft, and by heading up to the next camp we would have that much less distance to cover tomorrow. Casey agreed to give it a try, with the understanding that we would head back down if the going got too tough. Luckily the ridge was clear and we made fast progress up the ridge.    &lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;  At 8,400&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153; Joe and Casey found a nice campsite sheltered by some trees and the slope, so we dug our platforms for the tents and settled down for the night sometime around 11pm. Joe and I stayed up to have dinner and melt water, and by the time we went to sleep it was 2am.  &lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-sXp_EJ-WEBA/UOiFshSTJfI/AAAAAAABn9U/DekBJTTxBjc/s2000/91857.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img border=\"2\" src=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-sXp_EJ-WEBA/UOiFshSTJfI/AAAAAAABn9U/DekBJTTxBjc/s800/91857.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br style=\"text-align:-webkit-center\"&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Our ill-fated route up Mt Nebo\'s Cedar Ridge.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;h2&gt;\r\n&lt;a name=\"TOC-Saturday-February-19th\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Saturday, February 19th&lt;/h2&gt;\r\n&lt;h2&gt;\r\n&lt;a name=\"TOC-6:00-am---Breaking-Camp\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;6:00 am - Breaking Camp&lt;/h2&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;The howling winds had kept us awake last night, and occasionally a spindrift blew into the tent and onto my face. Still, we were well-rested enough to make a good summit attempt that day. As luck would have it the 1.5 ft of snow never appeared, so all that we had to look forward to was snow that was for the most part hard-packed. The wind scouring from the night before would make things even easier &amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#147; our chances at making the summit looked good.  &lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;  By about 8:00 am we had camp broken down and cached on the platforms to protect it from the wind. After marking a GPS coordinate to locate the cache upon our return, we headed up the ridge. We could see Mona far below, but soon we climbed above the cloud deck and were in a completely different world. The wind blew constantly at round 15mph with gusts up to 30mph, sometimes flinging stinging graupel into our faces.  As the temperature dropped ice began to form on my eyelashes. The going was tough, but it was also exciting!  &lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;  At 10,400&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153; we stopped for a brief snack. Tree line was finally making itself apparent and the more rugged parts of the ridge were beginning to appear.  There were some small cornices overhanging about a foot and we took notice of these.  Although visibility had deteriorated to a milky white after about 100 ft, we could still see some of the ridgeline ahead. By looking ahead we could see if there were cornices on the stretch ahead and how far back to stay. None of the cornices were very large.  &lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;  Although we kept on eye on what we could see, we mostly trudged along mindlessly in the tracks of whoever was breaking trail at the moment. The air was thin, dry and cold, the graupel stung our eyes, and we were very tired. Since Joe and I weren&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;t as concerned about this route as we had been on others we had climbed earlier in the winter, we fell into a false sense of complacency.  &lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;h2&gt;\r\n&lt;a name=\"TOC-11:00-am---Falling\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;11:00 am - Falling&lt;/h2&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-zRiRI5qRmXg/UOiL-b7oMeI/AAAAAAABn-I/-SYXqSKJWq0/s2000/100901.jpg\" style=\"text-align:-webkit-center\"&gt;&lt;img border=\"2\" src=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-zRiRI5qRmXg/UOiL-b7oMeI/AAAAAAABn-I/-SYXqSKJWq0/s800/100901.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;(Return climb on April 16th)&amp;Acirc;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;View of the South Summit and the upper portions of Cedar Ridge, as seen from Mount Nebo\'s Middle Summit.

As the slope began veering further to the right we could no longer see the left side of the ridge ahead. This was the side that the cornices were forming on.  &lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;  As I plodded up the slope I casually lifted my head up to take in what view I could when I noticed that we were walking parallel to the ridge, about 5 feet back from the edge. I also saw that the edge ended sharply &amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#147; it was likely corniced.  I began to worry since I had no idea how big the cornice was likely to be and was about to shout out to Casey that we should be staying farther away from the edge but it was already too late.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n        &amp;Acirc;&amp;nbsp;\r\n\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;table&gt;\r\n&lt;tbody&gt;\r\n&lt;tr&gt;\r\n&lt;td align=\"center\"&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-GgBULtwDGHc/UOiMwUZQqyI/AAAAAAABn-c/v2xJ-6S7YRg/s2000/100905.jpg\" style=\"text-align:-webkit-center\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"\" border=\"2\" src=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-GgBULtwDGHc/UOiMwUZQqyI/AAAAAAABn-c/v2xJ-6S7YRg/s400/100905.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;(Return climb on April 16th) Looking back up Cedar Ridge and the South Summit on our descent.

I saw a huge maw open up beside my right foot, and about all I had time to do was lunge over the gap. It felt as if I was being sucked downward, and my chest landed hard on the ridge. My arms were outstretched but there was nothing to grab on to &amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#147; I slipped back and suddenly I was airborne.  The slope below was so steep that I don&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;t recall feeling any impact. One moment I was falling and the next I was sliding, standing vertically on my toes as I tried to dig them into the slope. My snowshoes prevented me from getting much penetration in the snow, so I tried digging the handles of my poles into the slope, but by then I was rocketing down so fast that my efforts were futile. As I accelerated I could do nothing but kick and claw harder at the slope.   &lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-P1D9HqRlB2Y/UOiN5bBqQSI/AAAAAAABn-4/sbvnP26wKTg/s2000/100896.jpg\" style=\"text-align:-webkit-center\"&gt;&lt;img border=\"2\" src=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-P1D9HqRlB2Y/UOiN5bBqQSI/AAAAAAABn-4/sbvnP26wKTg/s800/100896.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;(Return climb on April 16th)&amp;Acirc;&amp;nbsp;Here it is; X marks the spot (by Joe Bullough)&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;span style=\"text-align:-webkit-center\"&gt;&amp;Acirc;&amp;nbsp;&amp;Acirc;&amp;nbsp; &amp;Acirc;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;  Everything happened so fast that I barely had any thoughts or feelings as I fell apart from &amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#156;I must stop myself before I reach a cliff or tree&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#157; and &amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#156;I&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;m going to die&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#157;.  I fought as hard as I could but nothing seemed to work. Everything was white around me and all I could here was a low rumbling sound of my body whipping down the slope. There was a brief moment that I was airborne again &amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#147; I was going off a cliff! Then I was sliding again, and then I was airborne again. I didn&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;t fall far but the brief loss of contact with the slope started to pitch me back and to my left.  I spread my arms and legs out further and strained with my legs and back to fight the overturning forces pushing me down the hill. By some miracle I was able to keep myself upright and facing into the slope.  &lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;  Finally I was beginning to slow down. I was now sliding through a cushion of snow that was getting thicker and harder, but it seemed to be slowing me down!  I was still frantic at the thought that I might accelerate again off of a cliff or down another steeper pitch in the slope, so I made the best of this deceleration and tried to swim up and out of the snow as I kicked my feet into the slope.  &lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;  Suddenly it was all over. I was no longer sliding. I brushed off a few inches of snow that was still covered me and stood up to take account of the situation. I was alive! Miraculously my only injuries seemed to be a slightly sore left quad, side and Latissimus Dorsi which were probably strained as I tried to keep myself upright and close to the hill as I fell. Then the severity of the accident hit me &amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#147; I was in the middle of a gigantic avalanche debris field. Chunks of snow stretched away from me as far as I could see. I looked at my topo map to get my bearings &amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#147; I had fallen around 1,000 vertical feet! Through the ghostly clouds and wind I faintly heard some shouting from above.  Joe and Casey were all right!  I couldn&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;t make out what they were saying and I was still out of breath, so all I could manage was a single loud yelp &amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#147; &amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#156;YEAH!&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#157;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-tZim6hgZs3U/TjEGKSTZDHI/AAAAAAAAhY4/Jwz4niPEXfs/s2000/MtNebo-Apr17-05-36CedarRidgeLabels.jpg\" style=\"text-align:-webkit-center\"&gt;&lt;img border=\"2\" src=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-tZim6hgZs3U/TjEGKSTZDHI/AAAAAAAAhY4/Jwz4niPEXfs/s800/MtNebo-Apr17-05-36CedarRidgeLabels.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Cedar Ridge seen from Mt Nebo\'s Middle Summit on our return climb in April.

Rather than being on the safe wind-scoured southern slopes of Cedar Ridge, I was now at the bottom of a large, open snow bowl. Based on the aspect of the slopes above me, I knew that the side of the bowl closest to me was north-facing, corniced, and had had heavy wind-loading from the past 24 hours.  Other avalanches could easy be washing down into the bowl.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;  The safest option I could think of at the time was to climb back up the way I had slid down. That slope had already avalanched, so it should be relatively safe compared to the rest of the slopes.  Besides, I was still a little delusional in thinking that I could just climb back out.  Sure it was about 1,000&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;, but I had all day, and maybe the upper slopes weren&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;t as steep as they looked on the topo.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;  I climbed up the ridge, but I was so pumped full of adrenaline and fear of further avalanching that I couldn&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;t keep a sustained pace. I kept getting exhausted and would stop every couple of minutes to rest. During these stops I tried to make contact with Joe and Casey. I was still rattled enough that I forgot about the emergency whistle in my pack, so I wasted breath shouting as loudly as I could.  Because of the winds I didn&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;t know if Joe and Casey had heard my earlier response &amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#147; I was worried that they thought I was dead! Throughout my time climbing back up the chute I never got a response.  &lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-jj9zGRcWQCk/UOiFvCjSmRI/AAAAAAABn9k/MbEBTy9IAUY/s2000/91856.jpg\" style=\"text-align:-webkit-center\"&gt;&lt;img border=\"2\" src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-jj9zGRcWQCk/UOiFvCjSmRI/AAAAAAABn9k/MbEBTy9IAUY/s800/91856.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;My daypack in the foreground of the cloudy couloir, with the cliffs that I slid near in the background.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;  My shouting echoed strangely, and as I ascended I saw why. Alongside the slope I slid down was a HUGE cliff! I let out a slew of exasperated cursing and kept climbing up the hill. The debris field seemed like it would never end. Finally I reached the scoured bed surface and encountered another surprise &amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#147; a large gash in the slope, perhaps 15 feet wide and about 2 feet deep. Whatever had avalanched had ripped out this gouge clear down to the underlying talus! This was probably one of the parts of the slope that sent me airborne. For some reason I got out my camera to photograph it &amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#147; perhaps it was an over learned reaction. About 50 feet higher I saw another gouge.   Then I reached a continuous crown that was a few inches thick.  The chute had a slight convexity in the center, so the crown had extended to the convexity, and shot straight up the slope for quite some ways before finishing its release to the other side. Just in case anything else came down the chute I stayed on this convexity in hopes than any further slides would wash to the sides.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;  The slope steepened and the bed surface became harder as I passed two more crowns. The slope seemed to be around 40 degrees now and I could barely kick steps, so I switched from my snowshoes to my crampons and got out my ice axe. As I front-pointed up the slope the ground got steeper and I became more concerned &amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#147; if the snow was really getting as hard and steep as it seemed, then I probably couldn&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;t climb out!  &lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;  Suddenly I saw a dark line in the clouds &amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#147; was this a rockband?  As I got closer I could see the wall with greater clarity. It too was a crown, but this one was almost as deep as I was tall!! I guessed that it was around 4.5 ft deep since it was about as high as my shoulders. It was monstrous, snaking like some evil serpent as it wound its way up the convexity like the earlier crowns, disappearing into the clouds above me. To the side of me I saw a foot-thick slab within the crown that had slid partway out beneath the snowpack, but friction had held it suspended. HANGFIRE!  Now I was really nervous. I climbed a little higher and saw that the thick crown at fractured into some thinner crowns on the other side of the convexity, allowing me to wind my way between the slabs.  At this point I lost my nerve to climb out this way. I had been climbing up the chute for an hour, but by now I didn&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;t care about making that wasted time.  &lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-sKA7y343tq8/UOiFt8-pRZI/AAAAAAABn9c/FQDn233Vm-g/s2000/91855.jpg\" style=\"text-align:-webkit-center\"&gt;&lt;img border=\"2\" src=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-sKA7y343tq8/UOiFt8-pRZI/AAAAAAABn9c/FQDn233Vm-g/s800/91855.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;The largest known avalanche slab that I knocked loose on my fall down from Cedar Ridge.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;  I carefully but quickly backed down the slope and within about 20 minutes of continuous movement I reached the end of the cliffs beside the chute. I pulled out my topo map to look at my next course of action.  &lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;h2&gt;\r\n&lt;a name=\"TOC-1:00pm---Finding-the-Way-Out\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;1:00pm - Finding the Way Out&lt;/h2&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Looking at the topo I saw that I might be able to walk down the canyon. It looked like there was a possibility of it cliffing out, and I would end up a long ways north of Willow Creek. I doubted that I would be out before nightfall if I went that way.  Also, I was worried that Joe and Casey were heading out, and I was anguished at the thought of the news of my likely death reaching my family &amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#147; I HAD to get out and get in touch with them before something like that happened!&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;  Finally I spotted a route that seemed safe and possible. About half a mile down the canyon the slopes were heavily forested and they also looked less steep than the slopes surrounding the bowl that I was in. There was a slight ridge on that slope and it met up with Cedar Ridge at about 10,400 ft. I remembered that point on the ridge! The terrain on that part of the ridge looked thickly forested and didn&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;t appear too steep. I traversed down the canyon, praying all the while that I didn&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;t set off any slides above me. I stayed a little high near the base of the cliffs but on a low angled slope. Every now and then I had to cross a break in the cliffs, and I did so quickly.  &lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-o-aJqg5PaBs/TjEGMEBgSHI/AAAAAAAAhY8/tjXZEVPAEGI/s2000/MtNebo-Apr17-05-37AccidentLabels.jpg\" style=\"text-align:-webkit-center\"&gt;&lt;img border=\"2\" src=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-o-aJqg5PaBs/TjEGMEBgSHI/AAAAAAAAhY8/tjXZEVPAEGI/s800/MtNebo-Apr17-05-37AccidentLabels.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Cedar Ridge seen from Mt Nebo\'s Middle Summit&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&amp;Acirc;&amp;nbsp;on our return climb in April&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;. Annotations show where I went in the whiteout to get out while avoiding avalanche hazards.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;span style=\"text-align:-webkit-center\"&gt;&amp;Acirc;&amp;nbsp;&amp;Acirc;&amp;nbsp; &amp;Acirc;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;  As I hiked down through the swirling white, graupel began to rain down. As it fell, the graupel didn&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;t stick to the slopes like snowflakes would. Instead, the balls of snow just rolled down the slopes, piling up in depressions and on flatter inclines. So much graupel was rolling down from above that the air was alive with a hissing sound.  Every now and then I ran into a thick patch of graupel, and although I was now hiking in my snowshoes, I sank in up to my waist in these little ball bearings. It was like wading through an exploded beanbag.   &lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;  Finally trees emerged from the clouds and my hopes began to rise. The forest became thicker, but the snow became softer. I had to face into the hill on some traverses to keep from sliding down through the deep powder, but at least I was safer! As I looked up the slope I could make out rocky ribs rising above the treetops &amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#147; definitely not the place to head back up. I could tell that it would be difficult to tell when I should start climbing back up.  &lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;  Eventually I reached deep and narrow chute cutting down the slopes. I couldn&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;t get into the chute because it was lined with cliffs, making the last 10-20 feet or so quite impassable. On the other side was a heavily forested ridge that rose as high as I could see. This might be the way out!  I followed the cliffs down a ways until I could find a drop that looked safe enough to descend. The snow was too steep to get purchase, so I stepped onto small pines lining the chute. I would hang onto the tree as I lowered/slid down to the next small pine, and repeated the process until I could slide the last few feet into the bottom of the chute. Then I ran across and tried to climb out the other side. Once again the snow kept sluffing off, so I had to pull myself up the slope by grabbing some of the small pines sticking out of the snow. Finally I was out of the chute and on the ridge!  &lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;  The ridge was very steep and the snow was very loose. I tried to snowshoe up, but as I pulled snow down I soon ended up chest deep in the stuff without having made any upward progress &amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#147; I was only digging myself deeper into the hill.  Through a combination of jumping and swimming with my forearms and poles, I was able to get through the easier parts. In the more difficult snow I had to pack down as much snow as I could, kick a step as deep as I could and as high as I could, plunge both poles into the snow above as deep as the handles. Then, as I pulled and then pushed down on the poles, I slowly raised myself on one leg, careful not to collapse the step. Once my leg was extended I replaced my poles higher, one at a time, and began working on placing the next foot.  &lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;  Progress was agonizingly slow, and sometimes it took several minutes to cover a few feet. The snow was so unstable that any rushing caused footholds to collapse, and it was a total body workout to make any progress up the hill.  Finally I got a rhythm down, and occasionally I reached short patches of snow stable enough to just walk on.  My heart had been beating furiously since I had fallen and I never seemed to be able to catch my breath - I always felt like I was about to be exhausted, but after a short break I always seemed to find the strength to move on. Picking resting points at landmarks every 20 feet or so seemed to help make the climb more psychologically manageable.  &lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;  Finally the sky above the trees turned lighter and I caught a glimpse of the ridge above. I was going to get out!  I pushed extra hard during the last bit and soon I was back at our tracks on Cedar Ridge ridge.  &lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;h2&gt;\r\n&lt;a name=\"TOC-4:40pm---Calling-off-the-Search\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;4:40pm - Calling off the Search&lt;/h2&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;I reached the ridge at 4:40. By then I had remembered my whistle, so I blew on it in hopes that Joe and Casey were somewhere on the ridge where they could hear it.  I hadn&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;t drunk any water since the fall, so I forced myself to drink some before racing down to camp. Once I got there I saw that everything had been cleared out &amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#147; they guys were on their way down. From my vantage point I could see our cars 3,000 ft below. There were a lot of other vehicles there too. Since we hadn&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;t parked at a real trailhead I doubted that these vehicles were those of other hikers &amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#147; it was SAR (Search and Rescue)!  &lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;  Finally I had cell reception back, so I called my father. I got the voicemail, so I said something to the tune of   &lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;  &amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#156;Hi Dad. It&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;s about 5:00 and I&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;m calling to let you know that we&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;ve been delayed a little bit on getting down the mountain, so we won&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;t be getting home by late afternoon like I said we would. We&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;ll probably be home sometime late evening. I love you, bye!&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#157; I admit that was a vague message, but at the time I didn&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;t want to scare him since I was fine, and I figured that if he then heard about the accident he would know that I was all right since I gave the late time that I had called.  &lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;  I knew that Joe didn&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;t have his cell phone on him, and I didn&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;t have Casey&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;s number, so next I called Shelley, Joe&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;s wife.    &lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;  &amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#156;Hey Shelley, have you spoken to Joe lately?&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#157; She was well aware of the situation and was thrilled to hear my voice. I told her that I was all right and to tell everyone to call off the search. Then I raced down the ridge.  &lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;  A few minutes later Casey called me on my cell phone.  I answered as I hiked down the mountain. He was relieved as I told him that I was racing down the mountain, nearing the 7,724&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153; flats and to call off the search. Luckily the rescue helicopters were still en route and were turned back. I told Casey that I should be down within an hour.  &lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;h2&gt;\r\n&lt;a name=\"TOC-6:15pm---Back-Down\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;6:15pm - Back Down&lt;/h2&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;I was practically running down the hill as I got closer to the bottom. My boots were loose and my toes were ramming into the toe-boxes, but I didn&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;t care. I slipped and fell a few times on some slush that was still melting on the talus. A little embarrassed, I hoped that I was high enough that the rescuers in the parking lot didn&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;t see me tripping over myself.  &lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;  I was heading down a wash about a quarter-mile from the trailhead when I saw searchers heading up through the brush. I hopped onto a rock and waved my poles in the air to get their attention.  I hurried down to them and was immediately inundated with questions.  &lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;  &amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#156;Do you have any aches or pains?&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#157;  &lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;  &amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#156;Just a little soreness in my back and right side.&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#157;  &lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;  &amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#156;We saw you falling down a few times up higher, are you all right?&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#157;  &lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;  &amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#156;Umm, yeah.&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#157;  &lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;  &amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#156;Did you have any loss of consciousness?&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#157;  &lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;  &amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#156;No. But I&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;m very dehydrated. Can we get some water out of my pack?&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#157;  &lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;  Everyone rushed around me and they were almost overbearing in their care as they &amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#152;assisted&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153; me in sitting down and taking off my wet outer layers of clothing. I was getting hot on the way down and had opened them to ventilate, so I was a little irritated when they replaced my hot clothes with a warm jacket, but at least it was dry. The mood was quite light as we strolled down to the car. The rescuers talked about some nice hunts they had had in the Willow Creek area as we walked down the hill.  I didn&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;t have time to be reunited with Joe and Casey as I was herded right into the back of the ambulance.  &lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;hr&gt;\r\n&lt;hr&gt;\r\n&lt;h2&gt;\r\n&lt;a name=\"TOC-Aftermath\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Aftermath&lt;/h2&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;  Ultimately the paramedics found nothing seriously wrong with me. My heart rate was very high and I had a lot of adrenaline in my system, as was expected. My left foot turned grey and went numb as the adrenaline subsided. My feet were re-heated but because my big toenail was black and took longer to recover, there was a concern of frostbite, so I was taken to a hospital in Nephi for a follow up examination before being released.  &lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;  The news media had caught wind of the rescue and were on the scene at the trailhead. Channel 4 followed me to the hospital and tried to pressure me into an interview as I hurried to the getaway car that Joe was driving, but I managed to escape. Apparently even though I refused to talk to reporters and hadn&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;t given consent to report on me in any way, all of the stations were running reports on the incident. None of them had all of the information correct, but all of them were using my full name. As I drove home with Joe I thought that everything was over and I could put it behind me, but I couldn&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;t get any relief. The Today Show and ABC&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;s Good Morning America wanted to interview me, and one of the New York offices had called my mom in Texas to get her comment about the accident, even though I hadn&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;t yet told her about it.  &lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;  Ultimately I decided to appease the media by doing an interview with Good Morning America since I was rather ambivalent about the situation apart from worrying family and friends, but by then everyone was already well aware of the accident.  After checking with Joe and Casey on how much anonymity they wanted, I went ahead and sat for an interview with ABC. Apparently even though they advertised the interview on the evening news broadcast, the interview was never broadcasted on Good Morning America. Somewhere between mudslides in CA and UT, a girl recovering from rabies, the world&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;s tallest twins, and a sexual harassment lawsuit involving Coco, the Gorilla, I lost out.  Frankly, I&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;m just glad its all over &amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#147; I&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;ve really just wanted peace and quiet since the accident, and I&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;m eager to have the media hoopla forget about me as quickly as possible so I can get on with my life.  &lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;2 months later I returned to Cedar Ridge with Joe Bullough and Glenn Merrill. We summitted all 3 of Mt Nebo\'s summits in a long car-to-car on a bright sunny day.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;hr&gt;\r\n&lt;hr&gt;\r\n&lt;h2&gt;\r\n&lt;a name=\"TOC-Analysis:\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Analysis:&lt;/h2&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;After the accident Joe and I talked about what had happened, and looking back on the incident we can see what we should have done differently to have been better prepared for the accident, and to have avoided it all together.   &lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;ul&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;Communication:&lt;/b&gt;  I had a cell phone to call for help if needed, but I was the only one with a cell phone on the mountain, so when I fell, Casey and Joe couldn&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;t call out for help until they got down to the cars. They also couldn&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;t try to reach me on my phone to determine my condition. I had brought 2 Motorola T5950 radios on the trip, but the intent was to practice with them for better communication on climbs where we would be traveling further apart. I had left them in the tent. In the future ideally everyone should have a radio and a cell phone if at all possible (in this instance we all could have brought a cell phone and a radio). For a more lightweight and reliable means of emergency communication, we all should have had emergency whistles and a predetermined set of codes by which to communicate with them (e.g. 2 blows for I&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;m OK, frantic blowing for HELP ME!!). I had a whistle, but that only limited me to blowing like a madman with no ability to communicate any better with others.    &lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;Complacency:&lt;/b&gt; Ultimately, what caused the accident was that Joe and I were too complacent on the route.  Our largest concern on winter outings had been avalanches, and since the route was safe from such a danger (or we could recognize a danger if one did exist based on obvious terrain criteria) we let our guard down in just following the tracks of whoever was leading. On trips where we have been more nervous we&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;ve always looked around for ourselves, rather than just following the leader. In this instance that would have prevented us all from getting on the cornice as Joe and I would have made our observations of the danger BEFORE we were within 5 feet of the edge.

Still, the \r\n\r\nmixture of snow, ice, hard/soft soil, and loose conglomerates made for some interesting climbing!&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"http://lh4.ggpht.com/-28jo-z8kCKQ/T_v1383ZhjI/AAAAAAABKxw/U1PISLxQj9U/s2000/2012-07-06%252520-%25252020a%252520-%252520Kitty%252520Litter%252520%252526%252520Skice%252520climbing%252520-%252520Nastia.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"http://lh4.ggpht.com/-28jo-z8kCKQ/T_v1383ZhjI/AAAAAAABKxw/U1PISLxQj9U/s800/2012-07-06%252520-%25252020a%252520-%252520Kitty%252520Litter%252520%252526%252520Skice%252520climbing%252520-%252520Nastia.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Kitty litter and skice climbing.

Eventually the ridge narrowed into a knife edge of precariously stacked blocks and plates. It is the sort of terrain where one could easily \r\n\r\nfall off as a whole section of the rock fails underfoot, or where one could get limbs mashed if you were standing in the wrong place compared to the \r\n\r\nrocks you knocked loose. The knife edge eventually ended, and there were no rappel slings in sight or good blocks to sling, so I backtracked and \r\n\r\nlooked down on a little buttress on the West side of the fin.&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-W5d0ei-zcEI/UAyqKz_j0UI/AAAAAAABLPM/S0db4d3CNjk/s2000/2012-07-06%2520-%252037%2520-%2520Looking%2520back%2520to%2520future%2520high%2520camp%2520on%2520annoying%2520traverse%2520-%2520annotated.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-W5d0ei-zcEI/UAyqKz_j0UI/AAAAAAABLPM/S0db4d3CNjk/s800/2012-07-06%2520-%252037%2520-%2520Looking%2520back%2520to%2520future%2520high%2520camp%2520on%2520annoying%2520traverse%2520-%2520annotated.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Route annotation looking back at the second approach crux where a second rappel or precarious downclimb must be made. There is also a nice bivy \r\n\r\nsite here, although it is still far from the route. Unfortunately we had to return to here after we were unable to find bivy sites farther along the \r\n\r\nridge.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\nI couldn\'t find any rappel slings but I saw some blocks that could maybe work for a rappel. However, the rock seemed a bit better here and I thought I \r\n\r\nsaw a reasonable downclimb from here. It looked improbably at first, but I had a hunch and figured it would be faster and safer than rappeling. I \r\n\r\nlowered off of a couple of steep drops and traversed on some catwalks, taking care to avoid the loose rocks. The loose rocks were dangerous here, but \r\n\r\nif you looked carefully you could climb around them. I then flipped the rope over a horn to direct the rope for Nastia just before a final steep \r\n\r\ndownclimb. Overall I\'d rate this downclimb a stiff class 3 to easy class 4, but with great caution needed with the loose rock.&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"http://lh5.ggpht.com/-VO3y2eyi2wQ/T_v2DXh4s7I/AAAAAAABKy8/QvC362PS9fk/s2000/2012-07-06%252520-%25252034%252520-%252520Class%2525203%252520Downclimb.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"http://lh5.ggpht.com/-VO3y2eyi2wQ/T_v2DXh4s7I/AAAAAAABKy8/QvC362PS9fk/s800/2012-07-06%252520-%25252034%252520-%252520Class%2525203%252520Downclimb.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Class 3 downclimb.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\nApparently Nastia found new rappel slings a bit farther down and behind the buttress (probably left from the climbers before us), but I encouraged her \r\n\r\nto just downclimb to me. As it turns out, Nastia has a knack for finding all of the loose rocks, so in the end this was not a good idea. Sorry \r\n\r\nNastia!&lt;/div&gt;\r\n&lt;div&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;/div&gt;\r\n&lt;div&gt;After the second step, we downclimbed a steep bowl (maybe 50-55 degrees) and began an endless traverse beneath the ridge gendarmes.

Although the \r\n\r\nconditions had slowed us a lot and it was late in the day, our early start seemed to have helped enough and it appeared that we would reach camp just \r\n\r\nin time before dark.&amp;Acirc;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;\r\n&lt;div&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;/div&gt;\r\n&lt;div&gt;At last we reached a break in the cliffs where we could climb up just before the Thumb Gendarme (note, it is plenty reasonable to stay a little \r\n\r\nlow and angle straight over to the base of the main cliff formation from here if you were starting from the prior bivy). We climbed up slopes of \r\n\r\nconsistently 40 degree steepness and eventually reached a choke some 50 feet long where the snow had thinned enough that melt-freeze cycles had caused \r\n\r\nit to form ice. This was one of the sketchier climbing moments of the approach as I led up it, since the ice was so thin that often my crampons would \r\n\r\npenetrate through and get stopped by the slabs &amp;amp; rock slurry beneath, and there was really no place for rock, snow, or ice pro until you are \r\n\r\nthrough the crux. Careful mixed climbing got us through this section (hard to rate as it was mostly just sketchy, but maybe cl. 4 50 degree snow &amp;amp; \r\n\r\nice?).&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"http://lh3.ggpht.com/-ODrHKkI0s_k/T_v2Hw7cTfI/AAAAAAABKzc/JsaAl9r5KSo/s2000/2012-07-06%252520-%25252041%252520-%252520The%252520Thumb%252520Gendarme.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"http://lh3.ggpht.com/-ODrHKkI0s_k/T_v2Hw7cTfI/AAAAAAABKzc/JsaAl9r5KSo/s800/2012-07-06%252520-%25252041%252520-%252520The%252520Thumb%252520Gendarme.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Thumb Gendarme.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\nWe reached the ridge crest just before the Thumb Gendarme, but we couldn\'t see a level spot nearly large enough for our tent. I could also tell that \r\n\r\nthe snow we had climbed up was thin enough that we could not excavate a platform large enough for the tent here, nor provide any real anchorage. Some \r\n\r\nphotos from bivies had looked like they were from right behind the gendarme, so I continued around but was dismayed with what I saw.&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"http://lh5.ggpht.com/-nCah2RAUteQ/T_v2Ih0vsiI/AAAAAAABKzg/bqo9PjaUcR0/s2000/2012-07-06%252520-%25252042%252520-%252520Behind%252520the%252520Thumb%252520Gendarme.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"http://lh5.ggpht.com/-nCah2RAUteQ/T_v2Ih0vsiI/AAAAAAABKzg/bqo9PjaUcR0/s800/2012-07-06%252520-%25252042%252520-%252520Behind%252520the%252520Thumb%252520Gendarme.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Traversing behind the Thumb, looking for a campsite.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\nThere was a narrow moat and steep, very icy slopes all along the backside. I actually front pointed and placed pickets along the way as I continued \r\n\r\nalong to the other side of the gendarme.

It seemed that I could have shoveled out a ledge, but Nastia had talked me \r\n\r\ninto leaving the snow shovel behind to save weight and bulk, with the idea that we could get by with our ice tools. Unfortunately for this spot that \r\n\r\ndidn\'t seem very feasible.&lt;/div&gt;\r\n&lt;div&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;/div&gt;\r\n&lt;div&gt;Unfortunately the sun was setting and the rest of the ridge beyond didn\'t look any more promising, and none of the guidebooks had listed camping \r\n\r\nsides any closer to the route, so we doubted we would find anything more going farther. We had no choice but to reverse our tracks and set up our tent \r\n\r\nat the base of the last dowclimbing/rappel. We got to camp well after dark, chopped out a space for the tent, and went to sleep well after \r\n\r\nmidnight.&lt;/div&gt;\r\n&lt;div&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;/div&gt;\r\n&lt;div&gt;(Note: Later when we looked over route info, it turns out that the bivy site before the Thumb Gendarme was about 200 ft back along the ridge \r\n\r\ncrest, on the East side of the ridge. From where we were we couldn\'t see anything in that direction, and the East side dropped off precipitously, but \r\n\r\nwhen we later reviewed photos from other climbers, apparently there is a hidden niche just beside the last highpoint. If there is enough snow to stay \r\n\r\non the ridge crest, you could probably see this obvious site as you crested the rise before the Thumb Gendarme. If you take the bypass, you must keep \r\n\r\nthis in mind.)&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;hr&gt;\r\n&lt;hr&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;h2&gt;\r\n&lt;a name=\"TOC-Day-2-Rest-Day\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Day 2 Rest Day&lt;/h2&gt;\r\n&lt;div&gt;At least we were pretty tired from the 6,000 ft gain approach the day before, and I was concerned about Nastia acclimatizing sufficiently as she \r\n\r\nhad been unable to get high before the trip as she had planned due to bad weather. So we decided to sleep in and spend a day at the high camp \r\n\r\nrecovering and acclimatizing. Unfortunately this night and the next day conditions had warmed up too much to do the route, so this day would have been \r\n\r\nperhaps the last day of the season to safely attempt the route.&lt;/div&gt;\r\n&lt;div&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;/div&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"http://lh5.ggpht.com/-zVRP6tbwnmI/T_v2MLc1DxI/AAAAAAABKz8/A-RzUMKYXww/s2000/2012-07-07%252520-%25252001%252520-%252520We%252520Brought%252520KFC.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"http://lh5.ggpht.com/-zVRP6tbwnmI/T_v2MLc1DxI/AAAAAAABKz8/A-RzUMKYXww/s800/2012-07-07%252520-%25252001%252520-%252520We%252520Brought%252520KFC.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Who needs Mountain House.

This \r\n\r\nencounter, combined with the tons of trash I found on the backside of the Grand Teton\'s enclosure later in the summer are good examples of why \r\n\r\nclimbers need to be better outdoor stewards and practice \'Leave No Trace\' practices. Even if an area seems remote, your impact will be noticed, and \r\n\r\nfrankly I think crapping on a route without proper burial or leaving your non-compostable camp trash reduces the alpine enjoyment

and ideally be beyond the first crux cliffband before \r\n\r\nsunrise. Fortunately the sound of melting water had stopped overnight, so we figured things had refrozen.

Some of it was nicely frozen, but so much snow remained soft that we were \r\n\r\nvery slow retracing our steps. We reached the base of the first crux just at sunrise, perhaps 2 hours later than we would have wanted.&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"http://lh6.ggpht.com/-BK9By5ku_dw/T_v2vNcyklI/AAAAAAABK1I/8GiNo7uVlls/s2000/2012-07-08%252520-%25252003%252520-%252520Looking%252520back%252520at%252520sunrise%252520from%252520rapp%252520point.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"http://lh6.ggpht.com/-BK9By5ku_dw/T_v2vNcyklI/AAAAAAABK1I/8GiNo7uVlls/s800/2012-07-08%252520-%25252003%252520-%252520Looking%252520back%252520at%252520sunrise%252520from%252520rapp%252520point.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Looking back at Thumb Gendarme at sunrise from a rappel point.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\nApparently if we had gone another 100 yards beyond the Thumb Gendarme, there was a hidden level spot just large enough for our tent. Of course it was \r\n\r\ntoo late to care about that by now, but I\'ve noted it for future beta.&lt;/div&gt;\r\n&lt;div&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;/div&gt;\r\n&lt;div&gt;\r\nStaying right on the ridge crest, eventually it turns into a knife edge and cliffs out again. The guidebooks mention that a rappel is often done here, \r\n\r\nor that climbers leave the ridge crest earlier and traverse beneath this final fin (mentioned as a possible variation). I would say the latter option \r\n\r\nis probably a better idea.&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"http://lh4.ggpht.com/-XU7kZGCqBoo/T_v2vj-SsjI/AAAAAAABK1M/oy_AvOFS2v0/s2000/2012-07-08%252520-%25252004%252520-%252520Nastia%252520at%252520high%252520point-rapp%252520point.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"http://lh4.ggpht.com/-XU7kZGCqBoo/T_v2vj-SsjI/AAAAAAABK1M/oy_AvOFS2v0/s800/2012-07-08%252520-%25252004%252520-%252520Nastia%252520at%252520high%252520point-rapp%252520point.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Nasta at a rappel point.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\nI found a good block for setting up a rappel, about 50 ft off of an overhang down to the snow below. Since Nastia had trouble following the prior \r\n\r\nloose crux, this time I had her go first. She found the loose rock at the top too spicy for her taste, so we decided that we would have to backtrack \r\n\r\nand try the lower bypass.&lt;/div&gt;\r\n&lt;div&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;/div&gt;\r\n&lt;div&gt;For those considering this rappel option, the anchor was good, and the rock seemed OK heading down, and once past the lip it improves and you are \r\n\r\nclear of the rock. However, the rope drags over a lot of loose stuff, some of it large enough to injure you even with a helmet, so once you go over \r\n\r\nthe lip, you would not want to swing the rope to the sides!&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"http://lh4.ggpht.com/-sgrOSOWDnXw/T_v2wjQGv9I/AAAAAAABK1U/bsC8WfuEZl8/s2000/2012-07-08%252520-%25252006%252520-%252520Upper%252520Curtis%252520Ridge%252520at%252520Sunrise.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"http://lh4.ggpht.com/-sgrOSOWDnXw/T_v2wjQGv9I/AAAAAAABK1U/bsC8WfuEZl8/s800/2012-07-08%252520-%25252006%252520-%252520Upper%252520Curtis%252520Ridge%252520at%252520Sunrise.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Upper Curtis Ridge at sunrise.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\nUnfortunately by now I could tell we were too far behind schedule and were not moving fast enough to make up for lost time, so I made the hard call of \r\n\r\nsaying we should turn around. We couldn\'t reverse the route, so we would have to downclimb 1,500 ft to the Carbon Glacier, somehow get past the giant \r\n\r\nbergschrund, and pick our way off that glacier to get out. This was frustrating as we only had about 1,000 ft of steep elevation gain, mostly on snow, \r\n\r\nand we would be above the danger and could safely continue over the summit. Nastia really didn\'t want to turn around but I felt like we were building \r\n\r\nup too many deficits.&lt;/div&gt;\r\n&lt;div&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;/div&gt;\r\n&lt;div&gt;As we reversed our tracks and started downclimbing off the ridge, we had a nice sunrise view of climbers ascending Liberty Ridge. Through the \r\n\r\njoys of Facebook, I knew that one of the climbers was Bill Sherman. Nastia also knew that some of her friends were attempting the ridge that day.&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"http://lh4.ggpht.com/-WH1U5Leq4FU/T_v2xQOL29I/AAAAAAABK1Y/8KEKfoT0C44/s2000/2012-07-08%252520-%25252007%252520-%252520Climbers%252520on%252520Liberty%252520Ridge.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"http://lh4.ggpht.com/-WH1U5Leq4FU/T_v2xQOL29I/AAAAAAABK1Y/8KEKfoT0C44/s800/2012-07-08%252520-%25252007%252520-%252520Climbers%252520on%252520Liberty%252520Ridge.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Climbers on Liberty Ridge.

The traverse over looked to be very fast, and if we forewent the harder, more direct \r\n\r\nvariations, it looked like we could quickly traverse through most dangerous parts of the cliffs and be in safe enough terrain to continue. In case the \r\n\r\nrocks were loose, I could tell that if you stayed right at the base of the first cliff band, you would be beneath any projectiles sailing off from \r\n\r\nabove, and this path could be approached from the ridge crest. I gave in against my better judgment and suggested we quickly run back up and \'check it \r\n\r\nout\'.

It didn\'t look too bad and should go in about 20 \r\n\r\nminutes! However, now Nastia was having major doubts. Water was seeping down the cliff band, and streaming off the aid corners. The small trickle of \r\n\r\nrocks coming down had become more frequent, and then a large rock smashed into the top like a mortar, sending down a spray of rocks. This was all well \r\n\r\nclear of where we were but this was the obvious sign that we should turn around IMMEDIATELY!&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"http://lh4.ggpht.com/-7F2pjubDXj8/T_v2zJfIJRI/AAAAAAABK1k/lR2vQriPPRM/s2000/2012-07-08%252520-%25252010%252520-%252520Looking%252520up%252520from%252520High%252520Point.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"http://lh4.ggpht.com/-7F2pjubDXj8/T_v2zJfIJRI/AAAAAAABK1k/lR2vQriPPRM/s800/2012-07-08%252520-%25252010%252520-%252520Looking%252520up%252520from%252520High%252520Point.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Looking up from high point.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\nWe reversed our safe line at the base of the cliffs then ran out on the ridge crest to get clear of any fall line off of the route.

One hazard we hadn\'t considered was that as the day warmed, \r\n\r\nthe rocks lining the ridge above would drop ever-increasing amounts of rocks down our slope. Since the entire ridge is line with rocks, there really \r\n\r\nis no line that is safe from this, and the lower we got, the more exposed we were to rockfall from above.&amp;Acirc;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;\r\n&lt;div&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;/div&gt;\r\n&lt;div&gt;I have become accustomed to the buzzing sound that rocks make when they fly by in the air, but in this case the slope was low angle enough and \r\n\r\nsoft enough that rocks did not sail, but it was steep enough that they still flew down at very high velocities, but the soft snow dampened the sound \r\n\r\nof the incoming missiles. Smaller rocks made a rat-tat-tat-tat noise like a machine gun, growing louder as the pinwheel got closer. There were even \r\n\r\nsome large, flat, &amp;Acirc;&amp;nbsp;table-sized blocks that just made quiet hissing as they shot down the slope. They carried enough momentum that if they hit one \r\n\r\nof us or snagged the rope, things would have gotten bad in a hurry.&lt;/div&gt;\r\n&lt;div&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;/div&gt;\r\n&lt;div&gt;Needless to say, we moved as fast as we could until we neared the massive bergschrund, then took our best guess on where we might find a \r\n\r\ncrossing. Just as we began traversing to what looked like a pinch in the \'schrund, direct sunlight started to appear on the rocks and slopes above, \r\n\r\nand rocks began raining down at a much higher rate. We booked it to a short, steep cliff band that would provide protection as rocks sailed overhead \r\n\r\nor were deflected to the side.&amp;Acirc;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;\r\n&lt;div&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;/div&gt;\r\n&lt;div&gt;From there we could see maybe one spot with a bridge large enough to climb over, but it was thin and looked likely that we would punch through. \r\n\r\nPlus it was in the line of fire. The snow where we hid was supersaturated and as I climbed along the rock edge I kept sinking in up to my waist or \r\n\r\nsometimes deeper if I hit the moat. This was not solid enough to make a safe bollard out of. After some searching along the rocks I managed to find a \r\n\r\nplace to build a reasonably sufficient anchor out of a nut and cam. We built up the anchor and I rappelled off the lip and into the bergschrund, which \r\n\r\nwas much too wide to clear.&lt;/div&gt;\r\n&lt;div&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"http://lh4.ggpht.com/--Wva7UPrbFA/T_v2zal7AfI/AAAAAAABK1o/GSLkTkzr7fA/s2000/2012-07-08%252520-%25252011%252520-%252520Rapping%252520into%252520the%252520Carbon%252520Glacier%252520Bergschrund.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"http://lh4.ggpht.com/--Wva7UPrbFA/T_v2zal7AfI/AAAAAAABK1o/GSLkTkzr7fA/s800/2012-07-08%252520-%25252011%252520-%252520Rapping%252520into%252520the%252520Carbon%252520Glacier%252520Bergschrund.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;This is what bailing on Curtis Ridge looks like.

Despite having great weather in late June, the Pacific Northwest was suffering from lingering winter weather in mid-July, and winter conditions persisted on many routes in the Cascades. Since I was only in town for two weeks, I was willing to put up with a mediocre forecast in order to get up on the route and hopefully catch a weather window. Though we had originally planned to do the climb Thursday-Saturday, the NOAA point forecast got us to shift the climb to Friday-Sunday so that we\'d have the best weather on Sunday. Friday morning the forecast called for a good chance of rain &amp;amp; snow the first two days, and \"Mostly Sunny\" for Sunday and beyond. Two days of putting up with rain &amp;amp; snow until weather cleared or we popped above the clouds seemed an all right price to pay to catch the weather window Sunday. \r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\nTo be safe, we would also carry enough food &amp;amp; fuel for 5 days for the 3 day climb in case weather delayed us on the climb.

This was hard work and slowed our ascent more than expected. We took turns breaking trail, swinging leads about 6 times on the route.\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\nThe weather was still clear as the sun rose shortly after we rounded the Black Pyramid to ascend the slopes above Willis Wall. I took my sole climbing picture of the day then, as by the time we reached the top of the Black Pyramid, the storm had already broken.\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://lh4.ggpht.com/-YHEZdy0yj_k/Tm-go-MlnPI/AAAAAAAAv-k/aR27wrkONHk/s2000/2011-07-17%252520-%25252001%252520-%252520Eric%252520Leading%252520Beside%252520Black%252520Pyramid.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"http://lh4.ggpht.com/-YHEZdy0yj_k/Tm-go-MlnPI/AAAAAAAAv-k/aR27wrkONHk/s640/2011-07-17%252520-%25252001%252520-%252520Eric%252520Leading%252520Beside%252520Black%252520Pyramid.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Eric Nearing the Top of the Black Pyramid&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://lh3.ggpht.com/-74U0ZF0iDiU/Tm-gpUIakVI/AAAAAAAAv-o/NQudoyLgUMM/s2000/2011-07-17%252520-%25252002%252520-%252520Me%252520Climbing%252520Beside%252520Black%252520Pyramid%252520-%252520Eric.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"http://lh3.ggpht.com/-74U0ZF0iDiU/Tm-gpUIakVI/AAAAAAAAv-o/NQudoyLgUMM/s640/2011-07-17%252520-%25252002%252520-%252520Me%252520Climbing%252520Beside%252520Black%252520Pyramid%252520-%252520Eric.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Me following below the top of the Black Pyramid at sunrise. Storm arrival t-minus 1 hour.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\nWe moved at a snail\'s pace as we tired from the elevation and soft snow, but the snow kept getting softer and deeper. As I traversed over to the bergschrund crux, I was often digging through waist deep snow, right up to the ice pitch. By this time it was snowing hard and the wind was blowing around 30-40 mph. The ice pitch had a continual dumping of windblown snow that was sluffing off the slopes above. I got thoroughly drenched from these pervasive ice crystals as I climbed 1 pitch of ice through the whiteout, stopping every time snow poured down on me to brace myself and cinch up my hood. This pitch normally would have been pretty easy but conditions definitely added to the stress factor!\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\nEric took the next trailbreaking lead and found another nice pitch of sustained 40 degree ice. Though exhausted at this point, I welcomed the ice for the break it provided from the soft snow. Plus it was fun! I finished another pitch of ice to the top of the route.\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\nUnfortunately here the wind gusts picked up and visibility dropped to near zero. We had difficulty reaching the top of the Cap as a large bergschrund stopped us less than 100 ft from the top. Going left, it grew larger, so we backtracked to the right and end-ran it and were shortly on top of Liberty Cap.\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\nThe problem at this point was that we could barely see the snow 1 or 2 steps in front of us. Despite having our waypoints for descent set in the GPS, that only helped us for the larger scale routefinding. We realized that we could easily walk off a cliff or into a crevasse with the visibility as bad as it was. We were both thoroughly soaked and becoming mildly hypothermic. I was covered in rime ice, already had the \"umbles\" and was beginning to get the \"stumbles\" and both Eric and I had been shivering non-stop for the past 3 or 4 hours.\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\nThe last forecast we had seen showed the weather to dissipate Monday, so we decided it was best to set up shelter on the Cap to get warm &amp;amp; rested, and attempt to descend once visibility improved a bit more.\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\nWe dug a platform into the bergschrund wall that we had end-run and I built up some hardy wind walls. Despite the howling wind, the BD First Light we were using was pretty calm, and our biggest complaint was being buried from snow drifting over our tent. Eric took initiative and shoveled snow off the tent a couple of times throughout the night. \r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\nEverything in our packs was saturated, including our sleeping bags. Luckily neither of us was using down loft! We melted more water and spent the night gradually rewarming as we slept in our soggy bags and clothes.\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://lh5.ggpht.com/-XAN3zKzWMlU/Tm-3ABJtcCI/AAAAAAAAyEk/Dfn6mJ5ctu8/s2000/2011-07-22%252520-%25252021%252520-%252520Liberty%252520Cap%252520-%252520Annotate.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"http://lh5.ggpht.com/-XAN3zKzWMlU/Tm-3ABJtcCI/AAAAAAAAyEk/Dfn6mJ5ctu8/s640/2011-07-22%252520-%25252021%252520-%252520Liberty%252520Cap%252520-%252520Annotate.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;h2&gt;\r\n&lt;a name=\"TOC-Monday---The-Sorry-Soggy-Slog\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Monday - The Sorry Soggy Slog&lt;/h2&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://lh5.ggpht.com/-3uSpTv66FvM/Tm-gqAyBf5I/AAAAAAAAv-s/q9TiovZg0jI/s2000/2011-07-18%252520-%25252001%252520-%252520Liberty%252520Cap%252520Camp%252520-%252520Eric.JPG\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"http://lh5.ggpht.com/-3uSpTv66FvM/Tm-gqAyBf5I/AAAAAAAAv-s/q9TiovZg0jI/s640/2011-07-18%252520-%25252001%252520-%252520Liberty%252520Cap%252520Camp%252520-%252520Eric.JPG\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;The First Light survived the storm!&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://lh3.ggpht.com/-Cb4F2w-_UBE/Tm-gqhbV1iI/AAAAAAAAv-w/BLECwnj0gsU/s2000/2011-07-18%252520-%25252002%252520-%252520Rime%252520Encrusted%252520Pole%252520-%252520Eric.JPG\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"http://lh3.ggpht.com/-Cb4F2w-_UBE/Tm-gqhbV1iI/AAAAAAAAv-w/BLECwnj0gsU/s640/2011-07-18%252520-%25252002%252520-%252520Rime%252520Encrusted%252520Pole%252520-%252520Eric.JPG\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Rime covered snow pole.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\nHooray! We could now see about 20-50 feet! We were up early, packed up camp, and began navigating to our waypoints to bypass the Columbia Crest and GET DOWN. It felt like we were going pretty slow, but we actually made pretty decent time through the 50 mph gusts and whiteout as we found the right way off the Cap and around the Crest.\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\nThere was still tension in the air as we climbed, as all of the fresh windblown snow hid the crevasses pretty well. I punched into two as we descended the Cap. The first one was large enough that I stopped my fall by hooking the far side with my tool and stemming my legs. I ratcheted back up, rolled onto the near edge, then jumped across to keep up the pace. Barely a setback at this point.\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-3lDHxLS9JVY/ULK-4i1zXSI/AAAAAAABeuE/lGvroGuu038/s2000/2011-07-18%2520-%252003a%2520-%2520Descending%2520the%2520Emmons%2520Glacier%2520-%2520Eric.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-3lDHxLS9JVY/ULK-4i1zXSI/AAAAAAABeuE/lGvroGuu038/s512/2011-07-18%2520-%252003a%2520-%2520Descending%2520the%2520Emmons%2520Glacier%2520-%2520Eric.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Still covered in rime and annoyed as I climbed out of my second and smaller punch-in. I got much more thorough with my pole probing after this.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\nWe did get held up briefly in the seracs atop the Winthrop Glacier, as apparently you can\'t traverse straight over to the Emmons from the height of the saddle connecting the Cap &amp;amp; Crest (oops). For future reference, you still need to ascend a couple hundred feet up the Crest to bypass the seracs &amp;amp; \'schrund before dropping back town towards the Emmons Glacier. \r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://lh3.ggpht.com/-8OfGf4TmdxM/Tm-gr0KgNYI/AAAAAAAAv-4/K-974WM0H-8/s2000/Liberty%252520Ridge%252520GPS%252520Track%252520-%252520Summit%252520Traverse%252520-%252520annotated.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"http://lh3.ggpht.com/-8OfGf4TmdxM/Tm-gr0KgNYI/AAAAAAAAv-4/K-974WM0H-8/s640/Liberty%252520Ridge%252520GPS%252520Track%252520-%252520Summit%252520Traverse%252520-%252520annotated.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\nGradually the skies cleared and we found the Emmons Glacier wands. I put away the GPS, put my brain into autopilot mode (with the crevasse-search feature still engaged), and at last began a relaxed descent. I finally stopped shivering as we got more sunshine through the blowing clouds. Sadly the Inter-Glacier was too slushy for any real glissading, but we made good time rushing down the trail as thoughts of Doritos and beer in the car kept me at a steady 3mph clip. \r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://lh5.ggpht.com/-MNiWK2Uh42U/Tm-gecWkmWI/AAAAAAAAv9g/JO8h4UetbEI/s2000/2011-07-15%252520-%25252055%252520-%252520Rainier%252520Sunset%252520-%252520%252520Annotate.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"http://lh5.ggpht.com/-MNiWK2Uh42U/Tm-gecWkmWI/AAAAAAAAv9g/JO8h4UetbEI/s640/2011-07-15%252520-%25252055%252520-%252520Rainier%252520Sunset%252520-%252520%252520Annotate.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\nDespite being thoroughly trashed, I headed back to Mt Rainier the following weekend to climb Ptarmigan Ridge, a longer, harder, and arguably more classic route than Liberty Ridge. The weather forecast was much better for this climb, but Liberty Cap wasn\'t done with me yet ([&lt;a href=\"http://www.markpthomas.com/mountaineering/trip-reports/washington/mt-rainier-ptarmigan-ridge\"&gt;Liberty Cap Beating #2: Ptarmigan Ridge&lt;/a&gt;)\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;hr&gt;\r\n&lt;hr&gt;\r\n&lt;h2&gt;\r\n&lt;a name=\"TOC-Gear-Notes:\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Gear Notes:&lt;/h2&gt;\r\nWe brought 4 screws &amp;amp; 2 pickets between us.

We had to do a large end run to the far west side of the glacier at the beginning, and we couldn\'t find a route around the toe of Liberty Ridge.\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\nThe rock on Liberty Ridge\'s toe was very melted out and best avoided if possible. It was some of the most dangerously loose rock I have ever climbed. Rocks were also falling off the ridge crest regularly just below Thumb Rock.&lt;/div&gt;\r\n&lt;div&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;/div&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://lh3.ggpht.com/-77W31SZp8fE/Tm-gtAczZVI/AAAAAAAAv_A/ibSoqjsL10w/s2000/Liberty%252520Ridge%252520GPS%252520Track.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"http://lh3.ggpht.com/-77W31SZp8fE/Tm-gtAczZVI/AAAAAAAAv_A/ibSoqjsL10w/s640/Liberty%252520Ridge%252520GPS%252520Track.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Topo map with our GPS track of the Liberty Ridge climb and Emmons Glacier descent&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;hr&gt;\r\n&lt;hr&gt;\r\n&lt;h2&gt;\r\n&lt;a name=\"TOC-Links\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Links&lt;/h2&gt;\r\n&lt;ul&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://picasaweb.google.com/105894936663116565516/20110715to18LibertyRidge03?authuser=0&amp;amp;feat=directlink\"&gt;Picasa Album&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://www.supertopo.com/tr/Liberty-Cap-Beating-1-Liberty-Ridge/t11118n.html\"&gt;SuperTopo TR&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://www.summitpost.org/liberty-cap-beating-1-liberty-ridge/783262\"&gt;SummitPost TR&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;/ul&gt;\r\n&lt;/div&gt;\r\n&lt;div&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;/div&gt;\r\n&lt;/div&gt; \r\n'),(51,206,'/mountaineering/trip-reports/washington/mt-rainier-ptarmigan-ridge','Mt Rainier (Ptarmigan Ridge)','Liberty Cap Beating #2: Ptarmigan Ridge (IV, 55 degree snow/ice, AI2/WI2, 5.6/M3)','Trip_Report','content: &lt;div dir=\"ltr\"&gt;\r\n&lt;h1&gt;\r\n&lt;a name=\"TOC-Liberty-Cap-Beating-2:-Ptarmigan-Ridge-IV-55-degree-snow-ice-AI2-WI2-5.6-M3-\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Liberty Cap Beating #2: Ptarmigan Ridge (IV, 55 degree snow/ice, AI2/WI2, 5.6/M3)&lt;/h1&gt;\r\n&lt;h2&gt;\r\n&lt;a name=\"TOC-July-22-25-2011\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;July 22-25, 2011&lt;/h2&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://lh5.ggpht.com/-2Nc8I9aQiho/Tm-3oVcgFbI/AAAAAAAAyIQ/d2D1Ec61bqM/s2000/2011-07-22%252520-%25252073%252520-%252520Ptarmigan%252520Ridge%252520Area%252520Far%252520-%252520Annotate.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"http://lh5.ggpht.com/-2Nc8I9aQiho/Tm-3oVcgFbI/AAAAAAAAyIQ/d2D1Ec61bqM/s640/2011-07-22%252520-%25252073%252520-%252520Ptarmigan%252520Ridge%252520Area%252520Far%252520-%252520Annotate.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;div&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://lh3.ggpht.com/-zNIx6DXXPkQ/Tm-3pyb417I/AAAAAAAAyIU/D8ESFL43paI/s2000/2011-07-22%252520-%25252073%252520-%252520Ptarmigan%252520Ridge%252520Area%252520Upper%252520-%252520Annotate.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"http://lh3.ggpht.com/-zNIx6DXXPkQ/Tm-3pyb417I/AAAAAAAAyIU/D8ESFL43paI/s640/2011-07-22%252520-%25252073%252520-%252520Ptarmigan%252520Ridge%252520Area%252520Upper%252520-%252520Annotate.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://lh6.ggpht.com/-tWkawy6NVUs/Tm-4Al3sdMI/AAAAAAAAyKs/Eigi-Vyqdew/s2000/2011-07-23%252520-%25252020%252520-%252520Upper%252520Ptarmigan%252520Ridge%252520-%252520Annotate.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"http://lh6.ggpht.com/-tWkawy6NVUs/Tm-4Al3sdMI/AAAAAAAAyKs/Eigi-Vyqdew/s640/2011-07-23%252520-%25252020%252520-%252520Upper%252520Ptarmigan%252520Ridge%252520-%252520Annotate.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\nThough not as popular and well known as neighboring Liberty Ridge, many climbers who have done both consider Ptarmigan Ridge a better climb, and possibly the best route on Mt. Rainier.  The path of Ptarmigan Ridge is less direct and the position less striking, and sadly the real climbing ends at a much lower altitude than Liberty Ridge (ca. 12,200&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153; rather than at Liberty Cap&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;s lofty 14,112&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;.) However, Ptarmigan Ridge offers more technical climbing, with steeper slopes, more ice, and a choice of two finishes: A less popular variation that climbs through an icefall to the left, and the standard right variation that ascends a chimney system through a rock band and requires some technical rock climbing on perhaps the only good rock on the mountain.\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;h2&gt;\r\n&lt;a name=\"TOC-Friday-Mostly-Sunny-Approach-to-Observation-Camp\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Friday &amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#147; &amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#156;Mostly Sunny&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#157; Approach to Observation Camp&lt;/h2&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://lh3.ggpht.com/-lPCpB1GAzS4/Tm-20HiDYwI/AAAAAAAAyDU/M6e3jlfWZeo/s2000/2011-07-22%252520-%25252001%252520-%252520Essentials%252520-%252520Anastasia.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"http://lh3.ggpht.com/-lPCpB1GAzS4/Tm-20HiDYwI/AAAAAAAAyDU/M6e3jlfWZeo/s640/2011-07-22%252520-%25252001%252520-%252520Essentials%252520-%252520Anastasia.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Vital gear for an alpine climb&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\nAlthough it seems that most climbers these days climb the ridge after a long traverse across the Winthrop and Carbon Glaciers from the White River Trailhead, we opted for the original &amp;amp; more scenic approach from Mowich Lake. I wasn&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;t a fan of the 2 hour drive required to set up the car shuttle (or the 2 hour drive back after the climb), but this approach was so much more scenic than the White River one and totally worth the effort.\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://lh5.ggpht.com/-imuwNr8luiE/Tm-23soL4WI/AAAAAAAAyDo/dVy_sPRDmwM/s2000/2011-07-22%252520-%25252006%252520-%252520Mossy%252520Trees.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"http://lh5.ggpht.com/-imuwNr8luiE/Tm-23soL4WI/AAAAAAAAyDo/dVy_sPRDmwM/s640/2011-07-22%252520-%25252006%252520-%252520Mossy%252520Trees.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Rainforest hiking to the big mountain.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\nThe forecast for the weekend and all of next week was &amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#156;Mostly Sunny&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#157; with a high pressure system that settled in. The clouds at the Mowich trailhead apparently didn&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;t get the message, as we had to navigate in whiteout by GPS through Spray Park. Normally a nice meadow of wildflowers this time of year, we were still climbing on snow.\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\nI was getting worried that we wouldn&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;t be able to observe the mountain from our camp at Observation Rock, but fortunately as we got higher and the day dragged on the clouds lowered and we were treated with a spectacular view of the north side of Mt.

If it were composed of dog turd it may not have been so bad, but since it was actually composed of Cascade volcanic graham cracker, this made for some interesting class 2 scrambling with a heavy pack on. Though Anastasia was native to Portland and led WI4, somehow she has thus far avoided much of the loose rock in the Cascades, as she was scared stiff on this section. I just kicked down rocks and dug into the gravel until I got some small toe prints that would hold, and delicately moved across the terrain, telling her which rocks you can lean on, and reminding her to try to stay balanced on her feet and not lean in to pull on rocks. \r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://lh6.ggpht.com/-CJekgK5BwzM/Tm-35H6eLhI/AAAAAAABXlE/Gf3AuBTXFzY/s2000/2011-07-23%252520-%25252010%252520-%252520Beginning%252520the%252520Crud%252520Bypass%252520Traverse%252520-%252520Anastasia.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"http://lh6.ggpht.com/-CJekgK5BwzM/Tm-35H6eLhI/AAAAAAABXlE/Gf3AuBTXFzY/s640/2011-07-23%252520-%25252010%252520-%252520Beginning%252520the%252520Crud%252520Bypass%252520Traverse%252520-%252520Anastasia.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Beginning the Downclimb to Bypass the Rock Step on \'Dogturd\' Ridge&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\nWe were stopped by an overhanging rock step, but bypassed it by down climbing 40 degree snow slopes to the east for about 200 ft and traversing the rest of the ridge on the lower snow slopes.\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://lh6.ggpht.com/-8_pukjiAhis/Tm-35wDvczI/AAAAAAAAyKE/byfJH4FqCCA/s2000/2011-07-23%252520-%25252011%252520-%252520Anastasia%252520on%252520the%252520Crud%252520Bypass%252520Traverse.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"http://lh6.ggpht.com/-8_pukjiAhis/Tm-35wDvczI/AAAAAAAAyKE/byfJH4FqCCA/s640/2011-07-23%252520-%25252011%252520-%252520Anastasia%252520on%252520the%252520Crud%252520Bypass%252520Traverse.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Anastasia on the Bypass of the Rock Step on \'Dogturd\' Ridge&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\nSince we had another early day at camp, but I couldn&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;t easily venture higher on the mountain this day, I used my energy to make some productive additions to the high camp.\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://lh5.ggpht.com/-wmcmelh7__E/Tm-4CHJNbVI/AAAAAAAAyK4/_68cgIyMrIU/s2000/2011-07-23%252520-%25252022%252520-%252520Ptarmigan%252520Lander.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"http://lh5.ggpht.com/-wmcmelh7__E/Tm-4CHJNbVI/AAAAAAAAyK4/_68cgIyMrIU/s640/2011-07-23%252520-%25252022%252520-%252520Ptarmigan%252520Lander.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Alien Visitors to the High Camp&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://lh6.ggpht.com/-LPlfzP36d04/Tm-4DjPsGyI/AAAAAAAAyLA/jr_jaWriyfU/s2000/2011-07-23%252520-%25252024%252520-%252520Rock%252520Climber.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"http://lh6.ggpht.com/-LPlfzP36d04/Tm-4DjPsGyI/AAAAAAAAyLA/jr_jaWriyfU/s640/2011-07-23%252520-%25252024%252520-%252520Rock%252520Climber.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Our New Climbing Partner Was Rock Solid&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\nWe had another clear night so I spent another night doing night photography.

As the sun cast brilliant alpenglow on the rocks above little bits of ice trickled down the slope as we simul-soloed up slopes of continuous slopes of 40 degree neve with occasional short bits of ice. At first I thought the ice trickles were knocked down by the other climbers, but eventually the trickles grew larger and some rocks started coming down with them &amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#147; the sun was reaching the plastered rime on the cliffs above!\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\nAnastasia seemed used to this and climbed on. Coming from the more solid ranges of the Sierra and the Wasatch, I&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;m not used to projectiles flying at me, so now it was my turn to be the shaky-legged one. Eventually I got used to it and learned to keep my eyes &amp;amp; ears open to the sound of falling debris, and then tuck in my tools and keep my head down when the little barrage arrived. \r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://lh3.ggpht.com/-VrHF1JPr-jQ/Tm-4PqH1rJI/AAAAAAAAyMA/jFDsLwYON5A/s2000/2011-07-24%252520-%25252007%252520-%252520Starting%252520the%252520exposed%252520traverse.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"http://lh3.ggpht.com/-VrHF1JPr-jQ/Tm-4PqH1rJI/AAAAAAAAyMA/jFDsLwYON5A/s640/2011-07-24%252520-%25252007%252520-%252520Starting%252520the%252520exposed%252520traverse.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Rounding the Corner, About to Start the Steep Traverse&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\nAlthough the climbing was still easy, we did start placing screws at this point as we were more worried about a fall caused by getting hit than by lack of technique. I got my opportunity to lead just before the steep traverse.  We were encountering more ice now, and the traverse was quite a thrilling surprise &amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#147; 300 ft of continuous traversing on 55 degree ice, with a lot of exposure below. I front-pointed and swung tools the entire way, but fortunately the ice was easy enough if you tested placements, so I only placed one stubby every 100 ft &amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#147; just enough to keep one piece between us as we simul-climbed.\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://lh5.ggpht.com/-93JdB8tbTIs/Tm-4RPsVkxI/AAAAAAAAyMM/Rm1hz5ACsQk/s2000/2011-07-24%252520-%25252010%252520-%252520Ice%252520Pitch%252520After%252520Traverse.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"http://lh5.ggpht.com/-93JdB8tbTIs/Tm-4RPsVkxI/AAAAAAAAyMM/Rm1hz5ACsQk/s640/2011-07-24%252520-%25252010%252520-%252520Ice%252520Pitch%252520After%252520Traverse.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;First Pitch of Sustained Ice After the Steep Traverse&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\nNow it was getting fun as the slopes got icier and stayed in the 45-55 degree range. After the traverse Anastasia took off in the lead. She led the remaining pitches as we agreed that I&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;d get the rock pitch if she could have the ice pitches.\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://picasaweb.google.com/105894936663116565516/20110722to25PtarmiganRidge02#5651938689257384898\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"http://lh3.ggpht.com/-UdVGcl4yEmw/Tm-4Sul5K8I/AAAAAAAAyMY/BMZMUoMh_SY/s640/2011-07-24%252520-%25252013%252520-%252520Icy%252520traverse.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Another Traversing Ice Pitch&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\nThe route ascended a series of short icy headwalls connected by sections of steep traversing as we threaded the cliff bands. The climbing was great! Ice everywhere, but none of it was too hard so we made decent time. \r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://lh6.ggpht.com/-Q1KEf9PP28M/Tm-4TFKilYI/AAAAAAAAyMc/DANyC_AaJMo/s2000/2011-07-24%252520-%25252014%252520-%252520Fun%252520Ice%252520%252526%252520Sketchy%252520Anchor.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"http://lh6.ggpht.com/-Q1KEf9PP28M/Tm-4TFKilYI/AAAAAAAAyMc/DANyC_AaJMo/s640/2011-07-24%252520-%25252014%252520-%252520Fun%252520Ice%252520%252526%252520Sketchy%252520Anchor.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;One Stubby Anchor Backed Up with Tools.

We only had 4, and with continuous ice and a 30m rope, we had to stop every 300 ft to recover screws, and all anchors were built out of a single stubby equalized with two tools.

It was only about noon and now we had a little under 2,000 ft of slogging up snow slopes to reach Liberty Cap, with only 1 bergschrund crossing to keep us entertained.\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;h2&gt;\r\n&lt;a name=\"TOC-Liberty-Cap-Strikes-Again\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Liberty Cap Strikes Again&lt;/h2&gt;\r\n\r\nMy first hint that we were in trouble was when we stopped to eat a snack after the last technical pitch. I had been concerned about moving fast earlier in the day, and as we put our packs down Anastasia said\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\n\"See Mark, we weren\'t that slow. The team ahead of us is right there.\"\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\nThe climbers ahead of us had pulled away during the first half of the route, and I doubted that we had caught up to them.\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\n\"Where?\" I asked.\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\n\"Right by the seracs over there,\" she replied.\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\nI saw the seracs about 100 ft away, but there was no one there. Only footprints.\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\n\"Anastasia, there is no one there.\"\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\n\"Yes there is. I can see them moving!\"\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\nUh oh. Anastasia was hallucinating. I asked her how she was feeling and she admitted to feeling a bit tired and sick. I suspected that she had AMS and that we needed to get down ASAP. However, the route is not one that is descended, so our only option was to climb another 2,000 ft higher to Liberty Cap and make the mile traverse above 13,500 ft to the Columbia Crest before we could even being descending again.\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\nTo make matters worse, our sunny day had deteriorated into a mostly cloudy day, and the cloud level was at about 12,500 ft. It looked like I was in for another white-out traverse of the Cap.\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://lh5.ggpht.com/-zkRFoThj0uY/Tm-4bC0tHGI/AAAAAAAAyNU/lPKWLg09o-4/s2000/2011-07-24%252520-%25252028%252520-%252520Anastasia%252520approaching%252520the%252520schrund%252520crossing.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"http://lh5.ggpht.com/-zkRFoThj0uY/Tm-4bC0tHGI/AAAAAAAAyNU/lPKWLg09o-4/s640/2011-07-24%252520-%25252028%252520-%252520Anastasia%252520approaching%252520the%252520schrund%252520crossing.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Anastasia Nearing the Bergschrund Crossing After We Finished the Technical Climbing. The whiteout awaits ahead . . .&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\nAnastasia led out as I told her my suspicions and that we needed to get up and over the mountain fast. She got noticeably slower at this point, and by the time we reached 13,000 ft she plopped down and asked me to lead on. \r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\nThe higher we got the worse she got. At about 13,500 ft Anastasia started demanding that we stop and make camp and descend the next day on account of the whiteout and her feeling sick and exhausted. Although I was willing to stop with \r\n&lt;a href=\"http://www.markpthomas.com/mountaineering/trip-reports/washington/mt-rainier-liberty-ridge\"&gt;Eric on Liberty Cap&lt;/a&gt;, in that circumstance I knew that we could recover and be stronger for a continued descent. In Anastasia\'s case, I knew that if her problem was AMS, if we stopped up high we would be in even worse condition to descend the next day.\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\nAnastasia was too tired to care much about my concern, but I got her to keep going by giving her the rest of my food and water. By the time we got to Liberty Cap we were engaged in an tough case of tug of war, and every few minutes she stopped and tried to talk me into making camp.\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\n\"We are not making camp until we at least reach 12,000 ft on the Emmons Glacier,\" I said. That would at least put us just below the elevation where Anastasia started having problems, and it would have us on one of the major trade routes where it would be easy to get assistance for descent if her AMS got worse. I also secretly hoped that if I got her that far we could finish the final relatively straightforward 2,000 ft descent to Camp Schurman.\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\nFor a while Anastasia agreed to go along with my demand, but as she got more tired and sick, our pace slowed, and it became increasingly difficult to keep her moving. I felt bad about being so cruel in that respect, but I felt that we would be in serious trouble if we made camp, and that if she had enough energy to complain and argue, she had enough energy to keep moving.\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\n\"Anastasia, we can rest all you need to keep moving, but we cannot stop and make camp.\" This worked for a while, and we spent about half the time resting as she tried to eat and drink. Eventually she stopped caring about getting down and became resistant to continuing on again. I (half bluffingly) said I would only be willing to make camp sooner than the Emmons Glacier if I called for rescue with my SPOT device and cell phone. This worked for a while longer as she was not willing to call for rescue yet and the terrain had flattened. Unfortunately it only got us to the saddle between Liberty Cap &amp;amp; Columbia Crest, when we had to gain another 200\' to bypass the seracs that I knew were waiting for us above the Winthrop Glacier.\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\nAnastasia was getting disoriented enough at this point that she was getting lost, despite being tied into me! The clouds were so thick she couldn\'t see me at the end of the rope and couldn\'t make sense of the rope tension. She also fell into a small crevasse as she was no longer really looking out for herself. I brought in coils, increasing the danger of one of us pulling the other into a crevasse in hopes that she could better follow me and I could better point out crevasses I found probing. I knew that if I fell into one I would be on my own, so I moved very carefully. Visibility was as bad as when I had crossed the Cap with Eric the \r\n&lt;a href=\"http://www.markpthomas.com/mountaineering/trip-reports/washington/mt-rainier-liberty-ridge\"&gt;weekend prior&lt;/a&gt;, and although I had our GPS track, it was still very difficult to stay on course with all of these other curve balls thrown into the scene.\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\nAfter an interminable amount of time and bickering as she continued to resist pushing on, we finally reached the Emmons Glacier. For a while she improved as we descended. As I had hoped, we came across a climbing party, and although we seemed to be moving OK by this time, I asked them to tell the rangers at Camp Schurman about our situation, and that we might need assistance in the morning to finish descending.\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\nWe barely made it to 12,000 ft by sunset. By this point Anastasia was deteriorating again as she began throwing up the food she was trying to eat, and was falling down uncontrollably. After hopping across one crevasse on a slope, she fell down and almost slid into the next crevasse downhill before self-arresting. I &lt;i&gt;REALLY&lt;/i&gt; needed a second climber to help short-rope her! I didn\'t want to stop with her due to her condition, but between her begging to stop again, the fall and approaching darkness, I relented and chopped out a ledge with my ice tool and set up the tent.\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\nFortunately, despite Anastasia being so uncooperative and me being so unsympathetic to her pleas, we made amends and Anastasia admitted that as much as I was being a jerk, she was being stubborn and it was good that we had pressed on to get to where we were. I had my first bit of food &amp;amp; drink since topping out on Ptarmigan Ridge 9 hours earlier (it normally takes 3 hrs to cover the same terrain) and went to sleep.\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;h2&gt;\r\n&lt;a name=\"TOC-Monday-The-Joys-of-Bottled-Oxygen-and-Rescuers\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Monday &amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#147; The Joys of Bottled Oxygen and Rescuers&lt;/h2&gt;\r\n\r\n\"Mark! I\'m feeling a lot worse. We have to go down now!\"\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\nI woke to Anastasia\'s call for help at 1am. As I had feared, 12,000 ft was not low enough for her to improve, and although the initial rest had helped, now she was feeling a lot worse. At this point I knew that we were in an easy location for calling for assistance, that daylight wasn\'t too long away, and it would probably be safer at this point to hold tight until daylight and send for help instead of descending.\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-CSbkpHHea1E/Tm-4ddhUAyI/AAAAAAABVg4/0ANZuI-fgQo/s2000/2011-07-25%2520-%252003%2520-%2520Anastasia%2520on%2520Oxygen.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-CSbkpHHea1E/Tm-4ddhUAyI/AAAAAAABVg4/0ANZuI-fgQo/s640/2011-07-25%2520-%252003%2520-%2520Anastasia%2520on%2520Oxygen.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Anastasia on Oxygen During Our Assisted Descent&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\nFortunately within an hour climbing ranger Nick Hall and 3 volunteers had arrived. My message to the descending climbers had reached Nick and he had decided to head up and check on us. They also brought bottled oxygen and after checking Anastastia\'s A&amp;amp;O level she was put on the oxygen. This helped her feel better and she was finally able to eat food again without puking it back up. We helped one of the rescuers into our tent while the others bivied outside and waited for daylight. \r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-7j4zP2paYFE/Tm-4estNKQI/AAAAAAABXkU/-faZy3h0XxQ/s2000/2011-07-25%2520-%252005%2520-%2520Anastasia%252C%2520Mike%252C%2520David%252C%2520Nick.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-7j4zP2paYFE/Tm-4estNKQI/AAAAAAABXkU/-faZy3h0XxQ/s640/2011-07-25%2520-%252005%2520-%2520Anastasia%252C%2520Mike%252C%2520David%252C%2520Nick.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Anastasia &amp;amp; the Rescue Team&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\n2 hours later Anastasia was short-roped down the Emmons on oxygen while one of the volunteers and I carried her gear and the camp down. We made it to the ranger shelter without incident and spent the rest of the day eating and hydrating. Anastasia\'s dizziness and nausea dissipated and by the afternoon we were released and descended to the White River trail head.\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;h2&gt;\r\n&lt;a name=\"TOC-Reflections\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Reflections&lt;/h2&gt;\r\n\r\nI had been worried about whether I had taken the best action given our circumstances, as obviously I was pushing Anastasia very hard to keep moving, and we were at high risk for having an accident by doing so. It was relieving to hear from the rescuers that our decision to push forward up and over the Cap and to make it to where we did was probably the best one in a situation where there was no ideal solution. It was really good that we didn\'t stop higher as well because the sunny forecast for that week had changed again to a stormy one and it rained and snowed for the next several days on the mountain.\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\nAnastasia had ascended Mt Rainier at least 4 times prior and had been above 14,000 ft on a few peaks in California, all without incident. Between her history at altitude and a moderately acclimatized ascent (one night at 8,000 ft &amp;amp; one at 10,300 ft), Anastasia\'s sudden development of AMS was a huge surprise to everyone including her. \r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\nFortunately, we were as reasonably prepared as one could be for such an epic, we had made good decisions with what was available to us.  Although she will be more wary of ascending to high altitude as fast again and may start using some Diamox preemptively, Anastasia wasn\'t at all deterred from her alpine passions. Two weeks later she climbed the Price Glacier on Mt Shuksan (IV, AI3 cl.4-5).\r\n\r\n&lt;hr&gt;\r\n&lt;hr&gt;\r\n&lt;h2&gt;\r\n&lt;a name=\"TOC-Gear-Notes:\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Gear Notes:&lt;/h2&gt;\r\nWe brought 4 stubby ice screws, 2 screamers, and 2 pickets. In icy conditions like we had, 8 screws would be better for longer simul-climbing pitches and better anchors.  Bring 1-3 cams of 0.5&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#157;-1&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#157; for the rock pitch (optional - fixed piton may suffice for many).\r\n\r\n&lt;h2&gt;\r\n&lt;a name=\"TOC-Approach-Notes:\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Approach Notes:&lt;/h2&gt;\r\nWhite River Approach is preferred by many since you can do a round trip from the same trailhead. However, you have a LONG traverse crossing the Winthrop and Carbon Glaciers, requiring roped glacier travel and navigating crevasses. This approach becomes harder in later season and might be impassable as the glaciers open up.\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\nThe Mowich Approach requires leaving a car at White River TH and then driving 2 hrs to the Mowich TH.  However, this approach is more scenic, the lower camp has running water, and you don&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;t need to get out the rope until you start climbing above high camp.\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\nBoth approaches merge just before the final loose knife edge section of ridge before the high camp. This section is better earlier in the season when it still has snow cover. In later season you can drop down to the east on snow to bypass loose rock &amp;amp; a rock step, but by late season this might be melted out.

Now for those who don&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;t know Steph, when it comes to night photography (well, photography in general), nice route overlays, and well organized and thorough trip reports, she is like me X10. She is the Pacific Northwest version of me . . . or more as I see it, I&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;m the California version of her. We&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;ve been influencing each other&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;s habits of reports and graphics, and she has been a big inspiration for my changes in climbing style (e.g. siting campsites at aesthetic locations rather than just convenient ones, doing night photography in the backcountry, etc.).\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\nSince Steph is totally hard core about climbing marathons and doing carryovers (she&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;s a frequent visitor to the Pickets Range for alpine climbs), she was totally on board with my elaborate idea of a linkup+photography-oriented trip.\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-aMsbT613UtQ/UFGkVkN-ZuI/AAAAAAABUXI/5cuhz9D41xU/s2000/2012-09-02%2520-%252099a%2520-%2520Night%2520Camp%2520on%2520Owen.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-aMsbT613UtQ/UFGkVkN-ZuI/AAAAAAABUXI/5cuhz9D41xU/s640/2012-09-02%2520-%252099a%2520-%2520Night%2520Camp%2520on%2520Owen.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Camp on Mt Owen on a carryover of the Valhalla Traverse, Serendipity Arete, and North Ridge of the Grand Teton.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\nBasically, with a carefully situated base camp and some carryovers, in one trip we had hoped to knock off the following climbs:\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\n1. North Ridge of Middle Teton (II, 5.6)&lt;br&gt;\r\n2. Complete Exum Ridge on the Grand Teton (III, 5.7)&lt;br&gt;\r\n3. Serendipity Arete on Mt Owen (IV, 5.9)&lt;br&gt;\r\n4. North Ridge of the Grand Teton (IV, 5.8)(Classic Variation)&lt;br&gt;\r\n5. North Face of the Grand Teton (IV, 5.8)(Direct Finish Variation)&lt;br&gt;\r\n6. Southwest Couloir of Teewinot (II, cl. 4)&lt;br&gt;\r\n7. E Face Descent of Teewinot (II, cl. 4)&lt;br&gt;\r\n8. SW Ridge of Symmetry Spire (II, 5.7)&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\nAdditionally, to do these we planned to do the following traverses:\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\n1. Valhalla Traverse (II, cl. 3-4, steep snow/ice, rockfall/icefall hazard)&lt;br&gt;\r\n2. Owen-Grandstand Traverse (II, 5.7, 3-5 rappels)&lt;br&gt;\r\n3. Black Dike Traverse (II, cl. 3-4, moderate snow)&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\nIn the end in we managed to climb all of these in 9 days except for the North Face of the Grand Teton, and settled for the Italian Cracks Variation of the North Ridge, as these routes were no longer in condition due to an early season hail &amp;amp; snow storm that hit the mountain during our trip.\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\nWhat follows is a &amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#152;brief&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153; report of our trip, although each day had enough interesting experiences and fun photos to share that I&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;ll write a more thorough report later for each day, linked back to this page.

they appeared at a far greater frequency in \"scrambling terrain\" than I\'ve found in any other mountain range in the U.S. Interpret this how you will :-)\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;div&gt;\r\n\r\n* The traverses in the range to access or linkup routes are strongly reminiscent of climbs in the North Cascades (Steph\'s observation)\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;div&gt;\r\n\r\n* If you are on the west side of the Teton crest, or on top of a summit, you will be blasted by wind. I have never been in such a constantly windy mountain range.\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;div&gt;\r\n\r\n*There seem to be 4 general difficulty ratings in the Tetons: &lt;br&gt;\r\n   1. Not listed (cl. 2-5) &lt;br&gt;\r\n   2. cl. 3-4 &lt;br&gt;\r\n   3. 5.7 (which can range from 5.6 to 5.8+. It seems everything is rated 5.7, and I\'ve seen it written somewhere that if you are in the Tetons and in terrain harder than \'5.7\', you are off route) &lt;br&gt;\r\n   4. The rare 5.10 or harder&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\n* The ratings are STOUT. This is probably explained by the fact that many of the earliest climbs in the Tetons were put up by hard East Coast climbers like Jack Durrance and Fritz Weissner (think Gunks standards), and later on the Tetons were where many of the Camp 4 climbers of Yosemite\'s Golden Age went during their off-season from the Valley to do some alpine climbing. \r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\nConclusion: The Tetons are a full value alpine range not to be underestimated!\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;hr&gt;\r\n&lt;hr&gt;\r\n&lt;h2&gt;\r\n&lt;a name=\"TOC-Day-1:-Garnet-Canyon-Approach-and-the-North-Ridge-of-Middle-Teton-II-5.6-\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Day 1: Garnet Canyon Approach and the North Ridge of Middle Teton (II, 5.6)&lt;/h2&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://www.markpthomas.com/mountaineering/trip-reports/wyoming/teton-grand-slam-8-classic-routes-and-some-traverses-done-over-a-9-day-climbing-marathon/day-1-garnet-canyon-approach-and-the-north-ridge-of-middle-teton-ii-5-6\"&gt;Full Trip Report&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/b&gt;\r\n&lt;/div&gt;\r\n&lt;div&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/--L6qoMMzU38/UFKdZopvniI/AAAAAAABOjM/vNxDvh5A0HM/s2000/2012-08-31%2520-%252004i%2520-%2520Middle%2520Teton%2520from%2520base%2520of%2520Lower%2520Exum%2520Ridge%2520-%2520by%2520Steph%2520Abegg%2520-%2520annotated.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/--L6qoMMzU38/UFKdZopvniI/AAAAAAABOjM/vNxDvh5A0HM/s640/2012-08-31%2520-%252004i%2520-%2520Middle%2520Teton%2520from%2520base%2520of%2520Lower%2520Exum%2520Ridge%2520-%2520by%2520Steph%2520Abegg%2520-%2520annotated.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;North Ridge of Middle Teton seen from the start of the Lower Exum Ridge&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\nFor our first day, Steph and I lugged our heavy loads for 10 days of fun in the Tetons up the Garnet Canyon trail to establish our base camp at the Lower Saddle. From here we planned to do a multi-day carryover and then move camp to the Teton Glacier Moraine for other climbing before carrying over Mt Teewinot. \r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\nSince Steph had picked up our permits the day before, we got an early start and made it to camp early enough to set up and then do a quick nearby climb: The North Ridge of Middle Teton. Ortenburger called the climb II, 5.6 with 4.5 hrs listed for the climbing time from the Lower Saddle to the summit. We found it to be a pleasant and straightforward climb of just over an hour to the summit, and although we brought along a rope and rack, we never got them out except for one convenient rappel on the descent. The crux notch, which I guess is often wet, was dry for us and the climbing felt like stiff class 4 to very easy 5th. \r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-PG41eSTlr90/UFk4FdYsK8I/AAAAAAABS70/PzOe5BknWPI/s2000/2012-08-30%2520-%252047b%2520-%2520Downclimbing%2520Pinocchio%2520Pinnacle%2520-%2520Steph.JPG\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-PG41eSTlr90/UFk4FdYsK8I/AAAAAAABS70/PzOe5BknWPI/s640/2012-08-30%2520-%252047b%2520-%2520Downclimbing%2520Pinocchio%2520Pinnacle%2520-%2520Steph.JPG\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Downclimbing Pinocchio Pinnacle (by Steph Abegg)&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\nOn our way down we made sure to scramble to the tops of Bonney\'s Pinnacle and Pinocchio Pinnacle (which had more interesting climbing).

Finding our way to the Lower Exum in the dark was tricker than expected and we lost an hour ascending the wrong ledge system (twice!). \r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\nWe found the correct ramp shortly after sunrise and made quick work of the lower pitches, which had a variety of fun chimneys and cracks to climb. The Black Face pitch contained some incredibly steep and intimidating face climbing and was a great pitch! It is one my more memorable 5.7 face leads. A small storm cell drizzled on us just as I finished, but Steph followed up the slick rock as fast as ever. For the final pitch I took the more direct line (5.8?) which had fun, well-protected crack climbing. Just as I topped out another storm cell had drifted over and a deluge of rain and some hail hammered us while Steph strongly finished the last pitch in cold and slippery conditions.\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\nWe considered bailing down Wall Street, but the weather looked to be clearing again, and none of the clouds were building to any real height (hence no lightning concern), so we decided not to let a little cold and wet weather put a damper on the day. We had both climbed the Upper Exum before, so we simuled the route quickly, only belaying the Friction Pitch and a short section above the V-Pitch.\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\nWe enjoyed a nice summit, but had realized that the conditions and late start had slowed us enough that we would not be able to tack on the Valhalla Traverse today as we had originally planned. The descent was slowed by wet rock and thick clouds, but we picked our way down to the Lower Saddle without a problem, and had a relaxed evening preparing for the next day.\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\nOriginally we had planned to do the carryover in 2 days, with Valhalla being done this day. In light of the setback, and concern of unsettled weather, we wisely packed for 3 days of food &amp;amp; fuel in addition to the food for the half-day entrance traverse.\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;hr&gt;\r\n&lt;hr&gt;\r\n&lt;h2&gt;\r\n&lt;a name=\"TOC-Day-3:-The-Valhalla-Traverse-II-cl.-3-4-steep-ice-snow-rockfall-icefall-hazard-\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Day 3: The Valhalla Traverse (II, cl. 3-4, steep ice/snow, rockfall &amp;amp; icefall hazard)&lt;/h2&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;(Carryover Day 1)&lt;/b&gt;\r\n&lt;/div&gt;\r\n&lt;div&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://www.markpthomas.com/mountaineering/trip-reports/wyoming/teton-grand-slam-8-classic-routes-and-some-traverses-done-over-a-9-day-climbing-marathon/day-3-the-valhalla-traverse-ii-cl-3-4\"&gt;Full Trip Report&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/b&gt;\r\n&lt;/div&gt;\r\n&lt;div&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-4SYo9avjrDM/UFQUy4UXKCI/AAAAAAABOnc/b10fQD6HAKQ/s2000/2012-08-30%2520-%252041%2520-%2520Valhalla%2520Traverse%2520Start%2520-%2520annotate.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-4SYo9avjrDM/UFQUy4UXKCI/AAAAAAABOnc/b10fQD6HAKQ/s640/2012-08-30%2520-%252041%2520-%2520Valhalla%2520Traverse%2520Start%2520-%2520annotate.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Beginning Section of the Valhalla Traverse seen from the North Ridge of Middle Teton&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\nThis day was forecast to have the most unsettled weather, so fortunately we weren\'t climbing anything high or committing! We got an early start, got started off route again by heading down too soon from the Lower Saddle (oops) but things fell together quickly enough. This traverse is not to be taken lightly and I was surprised how scarily loose the rock was and how lethal the exposure is. We belayed the worst part, but still had to cross an active debris chute (several large ice blocks fell down as we worked out the best way to cross). \r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-yYaO35UdrEw/UFQU2WelTwI/AAAAAAABOns/WJwl9h0jOTM/s2000/2012-09-01%2520-%252044%2520-%2520Valhalla%2520Traverse%2520Crux%2520-%2520annotated.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-yYaO35UdrEw/UFQU2WelTwI/AAAAAAABOns/WJwl9h0jOTM/s640/2012-09-01%2520-%252044%2520-%2520Valhalla%2520Traverse%2520Crux%2520-%2520annotated.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Final Section of the Valhalla Traverse seen from our Valhalla Canyon Camp.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\nWe unexpectedly found a very nice camp on a high ledge directly across the West Gunsight Couloir from the Valhalla Traverse and the first storm with rain, hail, and lightning struck us just as we were getting the tent set up. Several more similar storms passed throughout the day, with sunny breaks in between, and that evening we were rocked with high winds and lots of hail.\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\nI was concerned about the weather for the carryover, but Steph insisted the last forecast she saw showed the next few days being solidly sunny.

Fortunately most of the accumulated hail seemed to have gone away, but there was still enough hail-formed snow and wet rock to make things interesting. As we ascended the ledges, we kept attempting to cut directly up and right too early, and on several occasions found ourselves on 5th class terrain, losing precious time (doh!). In the end it appears that the best way to go is to traverse much farther to the left than you would expect, then traverse much farther back to the right than you&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;d expect - basically, you spend more time traversing than climbing up. \r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-CZxBDQQNk-g/UFlMnmRlU4I/AAAAAAABTKs/kDBt8ZAVgEs/s2000/2012-09-02%2520-%252028a%2520-%2520Starting%2520P1%2520-%2520Steph.JPG\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-CZxBDQQNk-g/UFlMnmRlU4I/AAAAAAABTKs/kDBt8ZAVgEs/s640/2012-09-02%2520-%252028a%2520-%2520Starting%2520P1%2520-%2520Steph.JPG\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Starting P1 of Serendipity Arete (by Steph Abegg)&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\nBy the time we reached the start of P1, the winds had picked up, and it was evident that we would have some interesting snow cover to deal with. It was COLD! It was sunny in the valley below, but we could tell that we wouldn&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;t have sunlight for a while as we were on the backside of Mt Owen. Eventually we reached sunlight, but the winds kept us frigid for most of the day. Despite these discomforts, we thoroughly enjoyed the route. It is long and contains interesting routefinding and a variety of climbing, such as runout face climbing, hand traverses, knife edges, jam cracks, and a crux offwidth exit pitch. I freed the offwidth, and Steph followed opting for the 5.7 C1 variation. Neither of us were game for climbing this pitch with our carryover packs, so we hauled them for this pitch.\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\nWe had hoped to make it to the Grandstand this day, but between lost time on the approach, being slowed down by the wet, cold and windy conditions, and climbing slower with carryover packs, it was getting late in the day. The summit was farther away from the &amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#156;last&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#157; pitch of Serendipity Arete than we had expected, and by the time we reached the summit, the sun was setting. \r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\nFortunately there were plenty of bivy spots beneath the Koven Chimney and Steph made quick work of modifying a platform to fit our First Light tent. Oh well, we were concerned about the recent precipitation anyways, so we figured it would be better to take our time approaching the North Ridge anyways, in hopes that the days of consecutive sunny weather could clear off the snow and ice that we could see present on the northern aspects of the Grand Teton.\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-aMsbT613UtQ/UFGkVkN-ZuI/AAAAAAABTRs/AV3lbLV_oKQ/s2000/2012-09-02%2520-%252099a%2520-%2520Night%2520Camp%2520on%2520Owen.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-aMsbT613UtQ/UFGkVkN-ZuI/AAAAAAABTRs/AV3lbLV_oKQ/s640/2012-09-02%2520-%252099a%2520-%2520Night%2520Camp%2520on%2520Owen.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Owen Camp at night&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;hr&gt;\r\n&lt;hr&gt;\r\n&lt;h2&gt;\r\n&lt;a name=\"TOC-Day-5:-Owen-Grandstand-Traverse-II-5.7-3-5-rappels-\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Day 5: Owen-Grandstand Traverse (II, 5.7, 3-5 rappels)&lt;/h2&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;(Carryover Day 3)&lt;/b&gt;&amp;Acirc;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;\r\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://www.markpthomas.com/mountaineering/trip-reports/wyoming/teton-grand-slam-8-classic-routes-and-some-traverses-done-over-a-9-day-climbing-marathon/day-5-owen-grandstand-traverse-ii-5-7\"&gt;Full Trip Report&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\r\n&lt;div&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-Z4SO4BSit4A/UFbED_fMdpI/AAAAAAABOrw/vRP1lTne2nY/s2000/2012-09-03%2520-%252037%2520-%2520Mt%2520Owen%2520%2526%2520Steph%2520-%2520annotated.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-Z4SO4BSit4A/UFbED_fMdpI/AAAAAAABOrw/vRP1lTne2nY/s640/2012-09-03%2520-%252037%2520-%2520Mt%2520Owen%2520%2526%2520Steph%2520-%2520annotated.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Northern Section-Western View of the Grandstand Traverse seen from the Grandstand&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-uvdizS7Qs_A/UFbEFIVaL7I/AAAAAAABOr4/C9T9hqx12EM/s2000/2012-09-05%2520-%252039%2520-%2520Owen-Grandstand-NRidge%2520-%2520annotation.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-uvdizS7Qs_A/UFbEFIVaL7I/AAAAAAABOr4/C9T9hqx12EM/s640/2012-09-05%2520-%252039%2520-%2520Owen-Grandstand-NRidge%2520-%2520annotation.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Grandstand Traverse from the East (Teton Glacier Moraine)&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-n9HZs_3OCGA/UFGfWXJN-RI/AAAAAAABR-E/VmhbUVBeRqc/s2000/2012-09-03%2520-%252001%2520-%2520Grand%2520Teton%2520under%2520morning%2520alpenglow.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-n9HZs_3OCGA/UFGfWXJN-RI/AAAAAAABR-E/VmhbUVBeRqc/s640/2012-09-03%2520-%252001%2520-%2520Grand%2520Teton%2520under%2520morning%2520alpenglow.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Alpenglow on the North Face of the Grand Teton seen from Mt Owen&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\nUp and out early again, we caught a spectacular alpenglow show on the north face of the Grand Teton as we departed from the Owen Camp. We simul-climbed down the 5.4 section of the Koven Route and traversed south on some nice grassy ledges in the warm morning sunlight. After a few downclimbing steps, we reached a notch and tower and opted for the nice rappel station rather than the tough-looking downclimb to reach the notch and the cold, shaded west side of the south ridge.\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\nThe West Ledges route had a lot of snow left on the ledges, which made for less secure climbing, so we opted for another rappel at an existing station at some point. After more downclimbing of some very loose gulleys, we made it to a large ledge system that took us over to the 3 remaining rappels into the Gunsight Notch. \r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\nThe first two rappels went just fine, but on the third rappel I ended up too far to the east and was unable to swing back towards the notch highpoint as a corner blocked the maneuver. I had a mini-epic here that cost some time and left me on a small gear anchor to back up my precarious stance on a sloping ice ledge in the East Gunsight Couloir, which was solidly filled with hard neve &amp;amp; ice. I directed Steph to flip the rope and she made it to the notch, where she fixed the rope as a directional and I jugged back up the line with my Guide. Another routefinding error that cost us time (doh!).\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-xOnm-aOjgS8/UFlQkRn_PtI/AAAAAAABREA/_kkFmXh0X0c/s2000/2012-09-03%2520-%252020b%2520-%2520Leading%2520Notch%2520Pitch%2520-%2520Steph.JPG\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-xOnm-aOjgS8/UFlQkRn_PtI/AAAAAAABREA/_kkFmXh0X0c/s640/2012-09-03%2520-%252020b%2520-%2520Leading%2520Notch%2520Pitch%2520-%2520Steph.JPG\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Starting the 5.7 pitch out of the Gunsight Notch (by Steph Abegg)&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\nRock in the notch was incredibly loose, but quickly improved as I climbed the 4th class ledges out of the south side. I cut east and found the start to the 5.7 pitch that leads out of the Gunsight Notch on reputedly good rock. This pitch was very steep and the routefinding was tricky (at least for matching 5.7 climbing with protection opportunities), but the climbing was great! An enjoyable bit of real climbing for the day.\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\nWe traverse a wide grassy ledge on the Grandstand and then picked our way up the remaining 400 ft of scrambling to the top. Some wet slabs lower down and loose rock higher up added some spice. Fortunately even with the dry winter, there was still snow and running water here so we were able to conveniently resupply.\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\nWe had considered going for the North Ridge this day, but the conditions still had us wary. It was still early in the day, but the traverse had still taken much longer than anticipated and we decided it would be better to have another relaxing day at a superb campsite and save the North Ridge for the next day. Besides, our initial fast schedule had been to allow time to climb the North Face, and from the Grandstand Camp it was apparent that it was no longer in reasonable climbing conditions for us.\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\nThis was a good choice as the Grandstand Camp was a great place to hang out, and we would need a good rest for the next day&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;s challenges.\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-BbsDFaMPi1Y/UFGgyWhLIaI/AAAAAAABRHo/30WhnVaQAJg/s2000/2012-09-03%2520-%252064%2520-%2520Mt%2520Owen%2520at%2520sunest%2520alpenglow.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-BbsDFaMPi1Y/UFGgyWhLIaI/AAAAAAABRHo/30WhnVaQAJg/s640/2012-09-03%2520-%252064%2520-%2520Mt%2520Owen%2520at%2520sunest%2520alpenglow.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Alpenglow on Mt Owen seen from the Grandstand&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-PR-xsCU9Wzs/UFGg4E7fCmI/AAAAAAABRIA/v4z65Ei2x1A/s2000/2012-09-03%2520-%252070%2520-%2520Moon%252C%2520Owen%2520%2526%2520Teewinot.JPG\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-PR-xsCU9Wzs/UFGg4E7fCmI/AAAAAAABRIA/v4z65Ei2x1A/s640/2012-09-03%2520-%252070%2520-%2520Moon%252C%2520Owen%2520%2526%2520Teewinot.JPG\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Full moon over Teewinot &amp;amp; Owen seen from the Grandstand&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-93pzcAuPO64/UFGg6YBQMjI/AAAAAAABRIQ/1jjB0OqKQvg/s2000/2012-09-03%2520-%252072b%2520-%2520Owen%2520Long%2520Exposure.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-93pzcAuPO64/UFGg6YBQMjI/AAAAAAABRIQ/1jjB0OqKQvg/s640/2012-09-03%2520-%252072b%2520-%2520Owen%2520Long%2520Exposure.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Owen at night from the Grandstand&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;hr&gt;\r\n&lt;hr&gt;\r\n&lt;h2&gt;\r\n&lt;a name=\"TOC-Day-6:-North-Ridge-of-the-Grand-Teton-Italian-Cracks-Variation-IV-5.7-8P-\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Day 6: North Ridge of the Grand Teton (Italian Cracks Variation)(IV, 5.7, 8P)&lt;/h2&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;(Carryover Day 4)&lt;/b&gt;&amp;Acirc;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;\r\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://www.markpthomas.com/mountaineering/trip-reports/wyoming/teton-grand-slam-8-classic-routes-and-some-traverses-done-over-a-9-day-climbing-marathon/day-6-north-ridge-of-the-grand-teton-italian-cracks-variation-iv-5-7\"&gt;Full Trip Report&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\r\n&lt;div&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-lPf7RXLAUBA/UFfjie_wDYI/AAAAAAABOs0/o0x6AL--GKk/s2000/2012-09-03%2520-%252002%2520-%2520Grand%2520Teton%2520under%2520morning%2520alpenglow%2520-%2520annotated.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-lPf7RXLAUBA/UFfjie_wDYI/AAAAAAABOs0/o0x6AL--GKk/s640/2012-09-03%2520-%252002%2520-%2520Grand%2520Teton%2520under%2520morning%2520alpenglow%2520-%2520annotated.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;North Ridge of the Grand Teton from Mt Owen.

This terrain looked benign from below as the snow was hidden by the ledges, indicating that even the terrain above that looked fine was probably even worse. It was obvious that it would be foolhardy to press on to climb the classic Chockstone Chimney route, as we had read warnings about climbing the Chockstone Pitch and the Slab Pitch above if conditions were icy and we felt like the odds were pretty good that those pitches were in fact icy.\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-_d5Gb_HacN8/UFGcnFdHkkI/AAAAAAABSyw/C9it7WzrNWw/s2000/2012-09-04%2520-%252009%2520-%2520Steph%2520following%2520easy%2520P2.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-_d5Gb_HacN8/UFGcnFdHkkI/AAAAAAABSyw/C9it7WzrNWw/s640/2012-09-04%2520-%252009%2520-%2520Steph%2520following%2520easy%2520P2.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;The easier pitches on the North Ridge ended up not being so easy anymore . . .&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\nThe prospect of bailing from this high on the Grand and retrieving our camp at Lower Saddle seemed to be about as risky and unpleasant as pressing on with the route, and we figured the Italian Cracks Variation might not be as icy. At the very least, it was on the sunny side of the North Ridge crest and somewhat sheltered from the merciless wind.

The face climbing pitch was problematic as ice was in cracks that I needed for pro, and some ice dribbles blocked the easiest and most direct lines. I found myself traversing far to the right to get away from the main drippage and then made it to the Second Ledge with an additional pitch.\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\nSteph and I had discussed the prospect of taking the Second Ledge to the Upper Saddle as an options to get the carryover done without completing the route if conditions were bad, since it is only a few hundred feet of low 5th climbing. By the time Steph reached me on the Second Ledge she was shivering badly and thought she was slightly hypothermic. I asked about the early exit option but, being the stalwart partner that she was, she said she saw no reason not to finish the route after getting to where we were. She whipped out her sleeping bag, crawled inside, and started brewing hot water with the stove!\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-oXRLQ5XVmxQ/UFGdBQFe0LI/AAAAAAABS0Y/DgEfMRA4y8Q/s2000/2012-09-04%2520-%252027%2520-%2520Steph%2520brewing%2520up%2520on%25202nd%2520Ledge.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-oXRLQ5XVmxQ/UFGdBQFe0LI/AAAAAAABS0Y/DgEfMRA4y8Q/s640/2012-09-04%2520-%252027%2520-%2520Steph%2520brewing%2520up%2520on%25202nd%2520Ledge.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Steph rewarming on the Second Ledge&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\nFully rewarmed and refreshed, we continued up the last few pitches to the top.

While we were in the area, then maybe we could move camp up the SW Couloir of Teewinot for some spectacular photography opportunities before carrying camp out the final day.\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\nAlas, conditions on the North Ridge showed us that it would be a bad idea to climb the North Face, and that the route likely wouldn&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;t come back into condition while we were in the Tetons, if at all this season (take note, the Pendulum Pitches looked to be a major drainage of meltwater-turned-ice). Still, we liked the idea of doing some exploring and seeing some rarely glimpsed aspects of the Grand, and Steph shared my eagerness in camping out unnecessarily on the backside of Teewinot.\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\nWe had a semi-leisurely start time and traversed along the Black Dike, through Glencoe Col, descending the loose rock to Teepe Col, where we had a nice second breakfast while enjoying the great panoramic views of Middle Teton and Garnet Canyon. This rock, while loose, wasn&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;t nearly as bad as the Valhalla Traverse, and between the sunshine and lack of wind, we were finally warm enough to strip back down to our shorts and t-shirts for a change.\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-CHtNPXORIXs/UFRbQlDd1GI/AAAAAAABOqM/HjWLJQM_q_c/s2000/2012-08-27%2520-%252002a%2520-%2520Tetons%2520after%2520rain%2520cleared%2520out%2520the%2520smoke%2520-%2520annotated%2520Black%2520Dike%2520Only.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-CHtNPXORIXs/UFRbQlDd1GI/AAAAAAABOqM/HjWLJQM_q_c/s640/2012-08-27%2520-%252002a%2520-%2520Tetons%2520after%2520rain%2520cleared%2520out%2520the%2520smoke%2520-%2520annotated%2520Black%2520Dike%2520Only.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Eastern Portion of the Black Dike Traverse seen from the valley floor.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\nI stripped down a little too early, though, as we then descended the Teepe Glacier, which required us to finally make use of our crampons and ice axes. The crampons weren&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;t terribly secure on tennis shoes, and there was a &amp;Acirc;&amp;frac12;&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#157;-1&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#157; layer of soft snow on top of the ice underneath, which prevented the crampons from digging into the ice properly. I showed Steph where the least secure part of the descent was by falling and self-arresting, giving myself a few cuts and bruises and providing myself with the cold &amp;amp; wet dousing of the day (we had one every single day after our first day, so this seemed a fitting pattern).\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\nThe descent from Dike Col really sucked, though. It was very steep and the rock was extremely loose. So loose that later on wind knocked rocks loose at the top, which fell the 1,000 feet down the gulley and all the way across the permanent snowfield, crashing into the moraine at the terminus. Still, it was not nearly as bad as the Valhalla Traverse. \r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\nWe picked our way down and managed to avoid getting on any snow by keeping skier&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;s left and then cutting over into the next chute. At one point we got a little cliffed out, but after lowering our packs down the impasse, found it to be a straightforward class 4 downclimb. What a difference the packs make!\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\nWe traversed around the Teton Glacier moraine, left our heavy packs at the start of the SW Couloir route, and scrambled to the top of the moraine for some nice views of the northeast side of the Grand. We dropped down to a good river by the tarn lake within the moraine to stock up on water for the night and next day (there was no snow or running water on Teewinot), and spent several hours relaxing on the grass and slabs beneath the incredible East Ridge of the Grand.\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-bUoFiF_TaU4/UFQjIXqxWPI/AAAAAAABOos/9lnmUjp2GuU/s2000/2012-09-04%2520-%252025a%2520-%2520Teewinot%2520from%25202nd%2520Ledge%2520-%2520annotation.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-bUoFiF_TaU4/UFQjIXqxWPI/AAAAAAABOos/9lnmUjp2GuU/s640/2012-09-04%2520-%252025a%2520-%2520Teewinot%2520from%25202nd%2520Ledge%2520-%2520annotation.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Southwest Couloir of Mount Teewinot seen from the 2nd Ledge on the North Ridge of the Grand Teton&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\nWe returned to our packs and began the unpleasant by reasonably short slog up to the Teewinot Plateau. In keeping with our Teton tradition, we got lost early on in the route, right at the large grassy benches halfway up the southern aspect. The Ortenburger guidebook offers the unhelpful description of the route by being vague, apart from saying that the routefinding is difficult, and it is easy to get into climbing terrain that is above the class 4 route rating. This is accompanied by an aerial photograph of the area that makes the route look obvious, but in fact could not be matched at all with where we were from the distorted perspective of the cliffs above.\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\nWe ended up traversing on the grassy ledge too far up and right. Eventually we ditched the heavy packs to do a quick recon (and make the steepening, exposed scrambling more reasonable) and saw we were off route. However, we could see the correct line, and with only about 20 minutes of slogging effort wasted, descended, traversed back, and headed up the correct chute. It turns out that in as many words as the guidebook used to vaguely describe the route, it could have just as easily said to turn a hard left, almost backwards, once reaching the ledge, and take the first promising chute that one sees.\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\nThe chute was straightforward, and a large, imposing boulder passed easily through a cut in the cliffs on the right before traversing left out of the chute and onto the large flat plateau area. We found an excellent campsite, perfectly situated to enjoy the panoramic views of the Tetons for our photography, and settled in for the night.\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-nQstvxYAem4/UFGfMSajUPI/AAAAAAABTCw/AcaPy0iVYV8/s2000/2012-09-05%2520-%252073%2520-%2520Long%2520Exposure%2520Stars%2520above%2520Tetons.JPG\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-nQstvxYAem4/UFGfMSajUPI/AAAAAAABTCw/AcaPy0iVYV8/s640/2012-09-05%2520-%252073%2520-%2520Long%2520Exposure%2520Stars%2520above%2520Tetons.JPG\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Night Skies over the Tetons (by Mark Thomas)&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"http://farm9.static.flickr.com/8178/7960824496_95cb60c84c_b.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"http://farm9.static.flickr.com/8178/7960824496_95cb60c84c_b.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\" width=\"600\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Nighttime views of Teewinot before the moonrise (by Steph Abegg)&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"http://farm9.static.flickr.com/8040/7960826268_efb387f895_b.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"http://farm9.static.flickr.com/8040/7960826268_efb387f895_b.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\" width=\"600\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Early morning shot of the Grand Teton just before the sun rose.

We woke early to catch an amazing sunrise before packing up camp to head out.\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\nThe scramble up the remained of the SW Couloir route was straightforward, and we left our gear just after passing through the large notch to pick up on the descent. The summit area of Teewinot was really cool, and we spent a long time playing around on the different rock towers up there before finally descending the East Face.\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-dbQqbo1rzis/UFGY_p8ISCI/AAAAAAABSnY/nMXI7wC28lw/s2000/2012-09-06%2520-%252025a%2520-%2520Steph%2520on%2520Teewinot%2520Summit%2520w%2520Billy%2520%2526%2520the%2520Grand.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-dbQqbo1rzis/UFGY_p8ISCI/AAAAAAABSnY/nMXI7wC28lw/s640/2012-09-06%2520-%252025a%2520-%2520Steph%2520on%2520Teewinot%2520Summit%2520w%2520Billy%2520%2526%2520the%2520Grand.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Steph &amp;amp; Teton Bill (stuffed mountain goat, held down by a rock) on Teewinot, with the Grand Teton behind.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-smn7PPPe_CM/UFQjGSDw48I/AAAAAAABOok/0rSwl25KQyE/s2000/2012-08-27%2520-%252011%2520-%2520Teewinot%2520-%2520annotated.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-smn7PPPe_CM/UFQjGSDw48I/AAAAAAABOok/0rSwl25KQyE/s800/2012-08-27%2520-%252011%2520-%2520Teewinot%2520-%2520annotated.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;East Face of Mount Teewinot seen from the valley floor&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\nThe East Face isn&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;t a terribly interesting route and it mostly endless class 2 traversing on ledges with the occasional class 3 downclimb, and it is a bit loose in places (but nowhere near as loose as much of the terrain we had climbed on in the days prior!). The class 4 cruxes required some thought to downclimb securely, but we felt no need to use the rappel stations, even climbing in approach shoes with our large packs. Eventually we hit the very well worn climbers trail and descended the endless switchbacks down to the cars. From there I headed into Jackson Hole for a burger and beer while Steph disappeared (as is her custom), with plans to reunite for one last climb the following morning.\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;hr&gt;\r\n&lt;hr&gt;\r\n&lt;h2&gt;\r\n&lt;a name=\"TOC-Day-9:-Southwest-Ridge-of-Symmetry-Spire-II-5.7-\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Day 9: Southwest Ridge of Symmetry Spire (II, 5.7)&lt;/h2&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;(Car-to-Car)&lt;/b&gt;\r\n&lt;/div&gt;\r\n&lt;div&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://www.markpthomas.com/mountaineering/trip-reports/wyoming/teton-grand-slam-8-classic-routes-and-some-traverses-done-over-a-9-day-climbing-marathon/day-9-southwest-ridge-of-symmetry-spire-ii-5-7\"&gt;Full Trip Report&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/b&gt;\r\n&lt;/div&gt;\r\n&lt;div&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-ewsCO7pAB2w/UFfoOoJm72I/AAAAAAABOt8/R9ipWpMmFss/s2000/2012-09-07%2520-%252010%2520-%2520Symmetry%2520Spire%2520-%2520annotated.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-ewsCO7pAB2w/UFfoOoJm72I/AAAAAAABOt8/R9ipWpMmFss/s640/2012-09-07%2520-%252010%2520-%2520Symmetry%2520Spire%2520-%2520annotated.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Southwest Ridge of Symmetry Spire seen on the approach&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\nAs a bonus climb, we had talked about climbing the SW Ridge of Symmetry Spire. Steph&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;s parents had climbed it 30 years ago, and she wanted to climb the route as a bit of a homage to her parents. She had brought along some photographs from the climb in hopes of recreating some of the photographs with her climbing in them. She had even acquired her mother&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;s pants, pack, and ice axe that were used in the ascent to bring as props!\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\nI hadn&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;t realized it until Steph told me at the base of the climb, but this climb had some other potential significance as well. During our Teton climbing, I had led every pitch that was 5.6 and harder. Despite being a stronger climber than me, and far more comfortable soloing, Steph had not quite felt up to any of the 5th class leads, as she has been struggling in regaining her lead head since her &lt;a href=\"http://www.stephabegg.com/home/tripreports/washington/northcascades/vesper\"&gt;climbing accident&lt;/a&gt; in 2010 on Vesper Peak, from which her leg is still recovering. Although I offered my support in leading any of the pitches, we agreed that since she missed on out the leading thus far, she should have dibs on leading every pitch on Symmetry Spire. As it turned out, Symmetry Spire would be the first climb where she truly attempted to get back into leading trad, and she succeeded wonderfully!\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\nThe hike up was very nice, with a good climber&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;s trail the entire way, although the start of the route is less obvious. We did our usual routine of starting off route before correcting, but soon we were gaining altitude and were rewarded with breathtaking views of the Cathedral Group to the south (Teewinot, Owen, Grand Teton).\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-_IcWbkAs5Ho/UFGhtEAV0sI/AAAAAAABTGE/8j3a5uV5JdM/s2000/2012-09-07%2520-%252035%2520-%2520Teewinot%252C%2520Owen%2520%2526%2520the%2520Grand.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-_IcWbkAs5Ho/UFGhtEAV0sI/AAAAAAABTGE/8j3a5uV5JdM/s640/2012-09-07%2520-%252035%2520-%2520Teewinot%252C%2520Owen%2520%2526%2520the%2520Grand.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Nice views of the Cathedral Group from the Southwest Ridge&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\nWe had a successful day in tracking down most of the photo spots, and after so many days of freezing and windy conditions, we had a relatively straightforward climb in very comfortable conditions. This route is deserving of it&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;s status as a Teton classic as it has good solid rock, an interesting line with great views, and the ratings are stout.\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\nTime passed too quickly on the summit and  soon we were heading down the descent gully and back to our cars. I headed back to California while Steph continued on for a solo backpacking trip into Titcomb Basin. Our Teton Grand Slam was a great success, especially considering the tough conditions, and we proved to be a strong and compatible climbing &amp;amp; photography team. Hopefully we can team up again for another big adventure!\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;table border=\"1\"&gt;\r\n&lt;tbody&gt;\r\n&lt;tr&gt;\r\n&lt;td&gt;\r\n&lt;i&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;/i&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-S3qjjTSfUaY/UMQ9cbdpnSI/AAAAAAABkeA/xdrFxt-sEK4/s100/AAC%2520Logo.jpg\" style=\"display:inline;float:right;margin:5px 10px\"&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;I also want to extend a big \"Thank You\" to the American Alpine Club.

straightforward 5.5 hr drive from Salt Lake City, I pulled into the Lupine Meadows parking lot at about 2am, searching for Steph Abegg, my climbing partner from Seattle who would be joining me for an ambitious multiday linkup and carryover of various routes on and around the Grand Teton. I quickly found a red Subaru Forester, and confirmed her car by spotting her custom Pickets climbing bumper sticker. I pulled around the backside, waking Steph from her slumber, hidden behind her Subaru. Oops! I threw down for a few hours of sleep and we were both up and gearing up by about 7am.&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"http://lh4.ggpht.com/-KDdX0zOMgs4/UFk3p5y31YI/AAAAAAABS3g/9n-1JgrXHP0/s2000/2012-08-30%252520-%25252000a%252520-%252520Cars%252520at%252520TH%252520-%252520Steph.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"http://lh4.ggpht.com/-KDdX0zOMgs4/UFk3p5y31YI/AAAAAAABS3g/9n-1JgrXHP0/s600/2012-08-30%252520-%25252000a%252520-%252520Cars%252520at%252520TH%252520-%252520Steph.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Subaru meetup!

We had 10 days worth of food and fuel, combined with overnight gear and climbing gear to lug up to our Lower Saddle Camp. Using my digital luggage scale, my pack clocked in at about 55 lbs with all of my gear and the rack. Steph\'s pack with her gear and rope clocked in at about \"redacted\" lbs! Steph laughed off the problem that while she knows the optimum weight to carry would be 1/3 of her body weight, she could never seem to get the pack below half her weight. Also, her doctor had told her to keep her pack weight under 30 lbs for the summer. So far she has done several large trips and still strives to meet that order :-)&lt;/div&gt;\r\n&lt;div&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;/div&gt;\r\n&lt;div&gt;By getting an early start we hoped to beat the heat on the climb up Garnet Canyon, and possibly even have enough time to climb the North Ridge of Middle Teton after setting up camp.&lt;/div&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-lOni94Kx0Os/UGGEsDc3UFI/AAAAAAABTuw/HIzF8k8zQ7U/s2000/Teton%2520Grand%2520Slam%2520-%2520GE%2520-%25201a.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-lOni94Kx0Os/UGGEsDc3UFI/AAAAAAABTuw/HIzF8k8zQ7U/s600/Teton%2520Grand%2520Slam%2520-%2520GE%2520-%25201a.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Travels for the day&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\nWe made short work of the switchbacks, and although we set a moderate pace, our conversation and steady pace made time pass quickly. By 10:30 we were at the Platforms Camp, where the easy trail hiking ended and the scrambling and climber\'s trail begins.

I had come up this way 3 days prior to climb Irene\'s Arete with my friend Thomas Bukowski so this terrain was very familiar. By the time we reached the Meadows Camp, I could clearly see Irene\'s Arete. Thomas and I had trouble identifying it before, but now that I knew exactly where it was, I admired the sheer arete and traced the climbing route and belays as best as I could as we passed by the Meadows and began the steep switchbacks up to the Caves Camp.&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"http://lh3.ggpht.com/-ZPwj_XQuGJo/UFGWmDaJBkI/AAAAAAABS3s/NP-PPDgncFw/s2000/2012-08-30%252520-%25252002%252520-%252520Irene%252527s%252520Arete.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"http://lh3.ggpht.com/-ZPwj_XQuGJo/UFGWmDaJBkI/AAAAAAABS3s/NP-PPDgncFw/s600/2012-08-30%252520-%25252002%252520-%252520Irene%252527s%252520Arete.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Irene\'s Arete from above the Platforms Camp.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"http://lh4.ggpht.com/-MqpIsWg17jU/UFGWrI4yi-I/AAAAAAABS38/DnTvdFg_1uM/s2000/2012-08-30%252520-%25252004a%252520-%252520Irene%252527s%252520Arete.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"http://lh4.ggpht.com/-MqpIsWg17jU/UFGWrI4yi-I/AAAAAAABS38/DnTvdFg_1uM/s600/2012-08-30%252520-%25252004a%252520-%252520Irene%252527s%252520Arete.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Irene\'s Arete above the Meadows Camp.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"http://lh3.ggpht.com/-GyURcJHJG-Q/UFGWsMgh41I/AAAAAAABS4A/EssDPhqTNBA/s2000/2012-08-30%252520-%25252005%252520-%252520Irene%252527s%252520Arete%252520profile.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"http://lh3.ggpht.com/-GyURcJHJG-Q/UFGWsMgh41I/AAAAAAABS4A/EssDPhqTNBA/s600/2012-08-30%252520-%25252005%252520-%252520Irene%252527s%252520Arete%252520profile.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Upper Irene\'s Arete in profile from the Caves Camp.

I was more than happy to tug on the lines to get through this section fast and securely, but Steph showed better form, casually ignoring the fixed lines for a proper scramble up to the Lower Saddle.&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"http://lh5.ggpht.com/-OxVCB5Uie-c/UFGWyDDPLcI/AAAAAAABS4Y/pzzDA_Fq_C0/s2000/2012-08-30%252520-%25252010%252520-%252520Steph%252520climbing%252520around%252520fixed%252520lines.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"http://lh5.ggpht.com/-OxVCB5Uie-c/UFGWyDDPLcI/AAAAAAABS4Y/pzzDA_Fq_C0/s600/2012-08-30%252520-%25252010%252520-%252520Steph%252520climbing%252520around%252520fixed%252520lines.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Steph climbing around the fixed lines.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"http://lh6.ggpht.com/-dvyxTeyds-s/UFGWzirG6FI/AAAAAAABS4g/tU54tF4dxMw/s2000/2012-08-30%252520-%25252012%252520-%252520Who%252520needs%252520fixed%252520lines.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"http://lh6.ggpht.com/-dvyxTeyds-s/UFGWzirG6FI/AAAAAAABS4g/tU54tF4dxMw/s600/2012-08-30%252520-%25252012%252520-%252520Who%252520needs%252520fixed%252520lines.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Steph \"I don\'t need no stinkin\' fixed lines\" Abegg stepping around.

Despite the late hour, we were fortunate to snag the best camp at the Lower Saddle. Hidden behind a large rock that serves as a windbreak from the prevalent windward direction, it is also the first one reached, and closest to the water source. Apparently the Upper Saddle has running water year round - and get this: it pours continuously out of a hose! I assume it is meltwater diverted from the Northwest Ice Couloir of Middle Teton, and this hose made water gathering at the saddle a very easy chore.&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"http://lh3.ggpht.com/-g47OYBGRFB0/UFk3ym-rMZI/AAAAAAABS48/Fw_lG_BOqTE/s2000/2012-08-30%252520-%25252016c%252520-%252520Getting%252520water%252520from%252520the%252520hose%252520-%252520Steph.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"http://lh3.ggpht.com/-g47OYBGRFB0/UFk3ym-rMZI/AAAAAAABS48/Fw_lG_BOqTE/s600/2012-08-30%252520-%25252016c%252520-%252520Getting%252520water%252520from%252520the%252520hose%252520-%252520Steph.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Getting water from the hose.

The Ortenburger &amp;amp; Jackson guide rates it II, 5.6, with 4.5 hrs listed as the typical time to summit from the Lower Saddle, so we brought along a rope, climbing shoes, and a light rack, with plans to solo and simul climb as much of the route as we could to make sure we were down before sunset. In the end it turns out it took us only 1 hour to reach the summit, and we never felt a need to break out the rope, rack, or climbing shoes. With solid rock, great views, and a short time needed to summit, this turned out to be a perfect warm up climb to do on the approach day.&amp;Acirc;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;\r\n&lt;div&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;/div&gt;\r\n&lt;div&gt;We left camp at about 2:30 pm and soon we were at the notch dividing Pinocchio Pinnacle and&amp;Acirc;&amp;nbsp;Bonney\'s Pinnacle.&amp;Acirc;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;\r\n&lt;div&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"http://lh5.ggpht.com/-aldSWwlEYuU/UFGW8BN_nQI/AAAAAAABS5M/VUV_4ZF1vfU/s2000/2012-08-30%252520-%25252019%252520-%252520Pinocchio%252527s%252520Pinnacle%252520%252526%252520Bonneys%252520Pinnacle.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"http://lh5.ggpht.com/-aldSWwlEYuU/UFGW8BN_nQI/AAAAAAABS5M/VUV_4ZF1vfU/s600/2012-08-30%252520-%25252019%252520-%252520Pinocchio%252527s%252520Pinnacle%252520%252526%252520Bonneys%252520Pinnacle.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Pinocchio Pinnacle (left) and Bonney\'s Pinnacle (right).

If you are going to belay a pitch on this climb, this is it. Apparently some climbers online found the broken terrain to the right of the notch too wet, and climbed directly out of the notch at a reported 5.8. The broken terrain was dry when we arrived, and we found it to be pretty light for the reported 5.6 grade (especially by Teton standards!). I\'d call it hard 4th class or very easy 5th class on fairly solid rock.&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"http://lh6.ggpht.com/-zOTeVs21fuk/UFGXI_dxxwI/AAAAAAABS6M/TF654GOnmYg/s2000/2012-08-30%252520-%25252031%252520-%252520Steph%252520soloing%252520the%252520crux%252520out%252520of%252520the%252520high%252520notch.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"http://lh6.ggpht.com/-zOTeVs21fuk/UFGXI_dxxwI/AAAAAAABS6M/TF654GOnmYg/s600/2012-08-30%252520-%25252031%252520-%252520Steph%252520soloing%252520the%252520crux%252520out%252520of%252520the%252520high%252520notch.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Steph soloing the crux out of the high notch.

The crux of the lower part was getting into the chimney, after which it was straightforward to ratchet the \r\n\r\nchickenwings and heel-toe position. This deposits you into a wider chimney that is capped with a large chockstone.&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"http://lh3.ggpht.com/-nZEIEbFW4nE/UFGX5Xw0p3I/AAAAAAABSqM/9BpDbGoJxNU/s2000/2012-08-31%252520-%25252009%252520-%252520P4%2525205_7%252520chimney.JPG\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"http://lh3.ggpht.com/-nZEIEbFW4nE/UFGX5Xw0p3I/AAAAAAABSqM/9BpDbGoJxNU/s600/2012-08-31%252520-%25252009%252520-%252520P4%2525205_7%252520chimney.JPG\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;P4 5.7 chimney.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\nThis second chimney is dealt with by some back-to-foot technique, and finished by some wide stemming to bypass the chockstone. As she followed the \r\n\r\npitch, I was amused watching Steph working out the contortions required to transition from chimneying to get atop the chockstone blocking the exit, \r\n\r\nand on the spot dubbed a fitting term to describe this awkward dance: The ChiChoMaMa (Chimney Chockstone Mantel Maneuver). I\'d say the \'beached whale\' \r\n\r\ntechnique, knee mantels, and any other sort of awkward humping over a rock could fit under this alpine dance of the wyde.\r\n&lt;div&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"http://lh6.ggpht.com/-8FNO44TDlJA/UFGX7DsITAI/AAAAAAABSqU/zfeqxUAIwb4/s2000/2012-08-31%252520-%25252011%252520-%252520Steph%252520doing%252520the%252520Chimney%252520Chockstone%252520mantel%252520move.JPG\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"http://lh6.ggpht.com/-8FNO44TDlJA/UFGX7DsITAI/AAAAAAABSqU/zfeqxUAIwb4/s600/2012-08-31%252520-%25252011%252520-%252520Steph%252520doing%252520the%252520Chimney%252520Chockstone%252520mantel%252520move.JPG\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Steph doing the ChiChoMaMa (Chimney Chockstone Mantel Maneuver).&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\nThe P4 belay had some nice views of Petzolt Ridge and the famous Window Pitch. We could also clearly see the developing weather. The sky was overcast \r\n\r\nwith altocumulus or altostratus clouds, and smaller cumulus clouds were forming to the west and south of the Teton range. Still, nothing was growing \r\n\r\nin height like a cumulonimbus, so we continued along.&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"http://lh3.ggpht.com/-39_Tebgt6zc/UFGX6D1l6II/AAAAAAABSqQ/0RYUXMQsh1k/s2000/2012-08-31%252520-%25252010%252520-%252520Petzoldt%252520Ridge.JPG\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"http://lh3.ggpht.com/-39_Tebgt6zc/UFGX6D1l6II/AAAAAAABSqQ/0RYUXMQsh1k/s600/2012-08-31%252520-%25252010%252520-%252520Petzoldt%252520Ridge.JPG\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Window on Petzoldt Ridge.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\nNext was the famous Black Face pitch, which is also the crux of the route. Steph had some pictures of her parents climbing this pitch, and Steph is a \r\n\r\nmuch stronger climber than me, so I had offered for her to get the glory pitch - also, I\'m more of a crack climber and I suck at face climbing, so I \r\n\r\nnever avoid an opportunity to skip out on face climbing duties. Steph wasn\'t feeling up for leading the pitch, though, so I nervously went about \r\n\r\ncreeping into this steep, imposing face.&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"http://lh6.ggpht.com/-WHiOPGlKJCc/UFGX9spCIrI/AAAAAAABSqc/_AdqQPOZTJg/s2000/2012-08-31%252520-%25252013%252520-%252520The%252520Black%252520Face%252520Pitch%252520P5.JPG\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"http://lh6.ggpht.com/-WHiOPGlKJCc/UFGX9spCIrI/AAAAAAABSqc/_AdqQPOZTJg/s600/2012-08-31%252520-%25252013%252520-%252520The%252520Black%252520Face%252520Pitch%252520P5.JPG\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Black Face Pitch, P5.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\nA short ways up I found a piton. Overall, about half of the gear on this pitch seemed to be pitons. &lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"http://lh3.ggpht.com/-jj9w-uizQsE/UFk9rUtsAEI/AAAAAAABSqo/qv8DDSnWCbk/s2000/2012-08-31%252520-%25252013b%252520-%252520Leading%252520P5%252520-%252520Steph.JPG\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"http://lh3.ggpht.com/-jj9w-uizQsE/UFk9rUtsAEI/AAAAAAABSqo/qv8DDSnWCbk/s600/2012-08-31%252520-%25252013b%252520-%252520Leading%252520P5%252520-%252520Steph.JPG\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Leading the Black Face, P5, nearing the first of many pitons. (by Steph Abegg)&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\nRight after the first piton you traverse a ways out right, with a delicate crux move to reach a corner and crack system a long ways out from the last \r\n\r\npiece. Take care not to fall here! A lot of the moves were on blocky and sloping holds, so it was somewhat insecure, but the holds were large and the \r\n\r\nfeet were decent. Still, the route was surprisingly steep for 5.7! The entire pitch was fairly sustained, and I would have to say that this has been \r\n\r\nby far the best pitch of 5.7 face climbing I have done thus far.&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"http://lh6.ggpht.com/-TOVbM-x5p2c/UFk9tloiOKI/AAAAAAABSqw/rPO28whmVHw/s2000/2012-08-31%252520-%25252013d%252520-%252520Leading%252520P5%252520-%252520Steph.JPG\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"http://lh6.ggpht.com/-TOVbM-x5p2c/UFk9tloiOKI/AAAAAAABSqw/rPO28whmVHw/s600/2012-08-31%252520-%25252013d%252520-%252520Leading%252520P5%252520-%252520Steph.JPG\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Leading the Black Face, P5, just at the crux to reach and head up some broken cracks in a shallow corner.

Between the wind, \r\n\r\nlack of sun, and cold water, things got cold fast. As I shivered in the rain and tried to warm my hands, I worried about Steph, as she still had to \r\n\r\nclimb this exposed pitch in the cold, wet conditions. It was sure to be slick as well. Without complaint, Steph scampered up to me without a problem, \r\n\r\nquite indifferent to the unpleasantness of the rain.&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"http://lh5.ggpht.com/-SPrXPPZGTwY/UFGYFuxBjjI/AAAAAAABSrI/HfIQ-BXZAx8/s2000/2012-08-31%252520-%25252018%252520-%252520Steph%252520following%252520the%252520Black%252520Face%252520pitch.JPG\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"http://lh5.ggpht.com/-SPrXPPZGTwY/UFGYFuxBjjI/AAAAAAABSrI/HfIQ-BXZAx8/s600/2012-08-31%252520-%25252018%252520-%252520Steph%252520following%252520the%252520Black%252520Face%252520pitch.JPG\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Steph following the Black Face pitch.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\nThe rain storm was short lived as the clouds blew over the Grand, although another suspicious set of clouds seemed to be hovering above Middle Teton, \r\n\r\nready to strike. Still, these weren\'t the cumulonimbus clouds that we feared, so I climbed on. I took the 5.7 variation of the last pitch, which \r\n\r\ncontained some fun and fairly consistent 5.7 jam cracks that took me nearly directly up to the Wall Street ledge. No sooner had I reached the ledge \r\n\r\nthan the rain resumed with a lot more intensity than on the prior pitch. I threw together an anchor, slipped on my rain poncho, and took cover with my \r\n\r\nfeet underneath the rope slack I pulled up as the rain turned to hail.\r\n&lt;div&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;/div&gt;\r\n&lt;div&gt;\"Poor Steph!\" I thought, as my hands numbed and I began to take in rope on belay. Now things were very wet and cold, and Steph was more exposed \r\n\r\nto the weather than I, getting more battered by the hail and faced with following the pitch under very wet conditions. Still, Steph arrived at the P6 \r\n\r\nbelay all smiles.&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"http://lh5.ggpht.com/-ixl5MEVnUfY/UFk9w1TkzKI/AAAAAAABSrQ/1U9sGP3p5wY/s2000/2012-08-31%252520-%25252019a%252520-%252520Belaying%252520Atop%252520P5%252520-%252520Steph.JPG\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"http://lh5.ggpht.com/-ixl5MEVnUfY/UFk9w1TkzKI/AAAAAAABSrQ/1U9sGP3p5wY/s600/2012-08-31%252520-%25252019a%252520-%252520Belaying%252520Atop%252520P5%252520-%252520Steph.JPG\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Staying dry belaying atop P6.

We had both done the route before and expected to get through \r\n\r\nit quickly, so we decided to press on. We shortened the rope for simul-climbing, and I took off up the Golden Staircase.&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;h2&gt;\r\n&lt;a name=\"TOC-Upper-Exum-Ridge\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Upper Exum Ridge&lt;/h2&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"http://lh6.ggpht.com/-sSObB6T0dPY/UFGYIYhTjJI/AAAAAAABSrU/Vpfcv9AMMJ8/s2000/2012-08-31%252520-%25252020%252520-%252520Simul-climbing%252520the%252520Upper%252520Exum%252520Ridge.JPG\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"http://lh6.ggpht.com/-sSObB6T0dPY/UFGYIYhTjJI/AAAAAAABSrU/Vpfcv9AMMJ8/s600/2012-08-31%252520-%25252020%252520-%252520Simul-climbing%252520the%252520Upper%252520Exum%252520Ridge.JPG\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Simulclimbing the Golden Staircase on the Upper Exum.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\nThe Upper Exum was the first alpine trad climb that I had led, &lt;a href=\"http://www.summitpost.org/a-windy-day-on-the-grand-teton/170226\"&gt;back \r\n\r\nin 2005&lt;/a&gt; with my friend Joe Bullough. Back then I was very nervous about exposure, which ultimately led me to stop trad climbing before I had \r\n\r\nprogressed much. However, beginning in the spring of 2010 I had resumed trad climbing with a vengeance, and so in 2012 it was interesting to revisit \r\n\r\nthis route that had been such a benchmark of climbing for me. Back in 2005 we pitched out much of the route, but now, even in the intermittent rain, \r\n\r\nthe exposure seemed nonexistent, and the rock was still providing relaxed, Type I fun as I jammed, crimped, and stemmed my way up the ridge.&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"http://lh3.ggpht.com/-UtC8NYnei0U/UFGYJTh0weI/AAAAAAABSrY/aEwGv4r_8rY/s2000/2012-08-31%252520-%25252021%252520-%252520Cloudy%252520Upper%252520Exum%252520Ridge.JPG\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"http://lh3.ggpht.com/-UtC8NYnei0U/UFGYJTh0weI/AAAAAAABSrY/aEwGv4r_8rY/s600/2012-08-31%252520-%25252021%252520-%252520Cloudy%252520Upper%252520Exum%252520Ridge.JPG\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Cloudy Upper Exum Ridge.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\nSmall cells of clouds continued to blow over us, but we still made relatively fast work of the route.&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"http://lh6.ggpht.com/-X-_79ksxuh4/UFGYOeXX8YI/AAAAAAABSrs/QJbuEtmHO2I/s2000/2012-08-31%252520-%25252025%252520-%252520Simul-climbing%252520the%252520Upper%252520Exum%252520Ridge%252520Wind%252520Tunnel%252520Pitch.JPG\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"http://lh6.ggpht.com/-X-_79ksxuh4/UFGYOeXX8YI/AAAAAAABSrs/QJbuEtmHO2I/s600/2012-08-31%252520-%25252025%252520-%252520Simul-climbing%252520the%252520Upper%252520Exum%252520Ridge%252520Wind%252520Tunnel%252520Pitch.JPG\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Reaching the Wind Tunnel (through the boulders).&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"http://lh3.ggpht.com/-oORmrAHYSCA/UFGYPPahiRI/AAAAAAABSr0/qVifHQWF1PE/s2000/2012-08-31%252520-%25252026%252520-%252520Steph%252520pleading%252520to%252520the%252520mountain%252520rain%252520gods.JPG\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"http://lh3.ggpht.com/-oORmrAHYSCA/UFGYPPahiRI/AAAAAAABSr0/qVifHQWF1PE/s600/2012-08-31%252520-%25252026%252520-%252520Steph%252520pleading%252520to%252520the%252520mountain%252520rain%252520gods.JPG\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Steph pleading to the mountain rain gods.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\nI had remembered the Friction Pitch being pretty thin and exposed, and with the intermittent rain, I was concerned about it being wet, so as we neared \r\n\r\nit, I traversed to a gully on the right where I remembered there being some more technical but more secure and better protected bypass options.&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"http://lh3.ggpht.com/-wkSvTZcbGbQ/UFGYQDo1hvI/AAAAAAABSr4/MthnEfZXH7g/s2000/2012-08-31%252520-%25252027%252520-%252520Friction%252520Pitch%252520Bypass.JPG\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"http://lh3.ggpht.com/-wkSvTZcbGbQ/UFGYQDo1hvI/AAAAAAABSr4/MthnEfZXH7g/s600/2012-08-31%252520-%25252027%252520-%252520Friction%252520Pitch%252520Bypass.JPG\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Investigating the Friction Pitch bypass.

We had read that the end of the traverse was a serious undertaking and felt that it would be a bad idea to do in the dark, so as we \r\n\r\nrelaxed on the summit and talked things over, we decided to have an easier day today and forfeit a day of our total trip to do a more leisurely \r\n\r\ntraverse.

In certain sections the rock is of the poorest quality, and belay anchors and protection are difficult or impossible to obtain.\" \r\n\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n  &amp;Acirc;&amp;nbsp; &amp;Acirc;&amp;nbsp; &amp;Acirc;&amp;nbsp; - Ortenburg &amp;amp; Jackson, A Climber\'s Guide to the Teton Range.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;\r\n&lt;/td&gt;\r\n&lt;/tr&gt;\r\n&lt;/tbody&gt;\r\n&lt;/table&gt;\r\n&lt;h2&gt;\r\n&lt;a name=\"TOC-The-Carryover-Idea\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;The Carryover Idea&lt;/h2&gt;\r\n&lt;div&gt;With careful reading of guidebooks and time spent farting around on Google Earth, I had pieced together several multi-day traverse ideas around the Grand Teton that could allow us to minimize the effort needed to link up various climbs in the area in one trip. The largest linkup I had dreamed up was to traverse from our base camp at the Lower Saddle over to Valhalla Canyon. There we could gain the Grandstand via the classic Serendipity Arete on Mt. Owen and a traverse from that summit (although one could directly climb the Grandstand from Valhalla Canyon). The Grandstand would serve as our launching point for climbing our main objective of the carryover - the North Ridge of the Grand Teton, from which we could then return to our remaining gear cache at the Lower Saddle. &lt;/div&gt;\r\n&lt;div&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;/div&gt;\r\n&lt;div&gt;The Valhalla Traverse was the key to us achieving this ambitious linkup as we could make a complete loop from the Lower Saddle without any need to hike back out. It was a wonderful idea, but it was also ambitious. We had originally planned to do the Valhalla Traverse the same day as the Complete Exum Ridge (the guidebook said we only needed 3-4 hrs to do the traverse), then climb Serendipity Arete to the Grandstand in a long day, and then finish climbing over the North Ridge. This would mean we would spend 2.5 days and 2 nights doing the linkup.&lt;/div&gt;\r\n&lt;div&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;/div&gt;\r\n&lt;div&gt;However, conditions on the Exum slowed us up enough that we decided not to tempt fate with the Valhalla Traverse that day, so we left an entire day for it, on the worst weather day forecast for our trip. Since I was wary about any additional weather slowing us up, we decided to pack for 4 full days and 3 nights\' worth of food and fuel just in case we were delayed a day. It was good we did this, since the storms on our first day, combined with the cold and windy weather on the days after made us take 4 days to do the linkup instead of 2.5!&lt;/div&gt;\r\n&lt;div&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;/div&gt;\r\n&lt;div&gt;For the record, it took us about 3 hours to do the traverse from the Lower Saddle to the West Gunsight Couloir. This traverse might be done faster with lighter packs, though it often might be slower as there is normally more snow and ice on the route. The Teton NPS maintains a good &lt;a href=\"http://tetonclimbingroutes.blogspot.com/\"&gt;web blog&lt;/a&gt; on route conditions in the area, and they often include conditions on this traverse.&lt;/div&gt;\r\n&lt;div&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"https://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/WSLC8Cg2aGyRZkUDVkvuzNMTjNZETYmyPJy0liipFm0?feat=directlink\"&gt;&lt;img border=\"0\" src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-bebYlpuZ9mI/UGGFFlb7SYI/AAAAAAABTwg/oRYxh2WsHCU/s600/Teton%2520Grand%2520Slam%2520-%2520GE%2520-%25202-6%2520Carryover-b,jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;The 4-Day Carryover Seen from Above&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"https://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/wPiZJ_xaFl2cywP9hrl_D9MTjNZETYmyPJy0liipFm0?feat=directlink\"&gt;&lt;img border=\"0\" src=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-AgQxEF-J9jA/UGGFDQfTztI/AAAAAAABTwY/4ExE6PuFbqs/s600/Teton%2520Grand%2520Slam%2520-%2520GE%2520-%25202-6%2520Carryover-a,jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;The 4-Day Carryover Seen from the West&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;hr&gt;\r\n&lt;hr&gt;\r\n&lt;h2&gt;\r\n&lt;a name=\"TOC-The-Valhalla-Traverse\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;The Valhalla Traverse&lt;/h2&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"https://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/AELYUtEpPuETI4mXYKEKvtMTjNZETYmyPJy0liipFm0?feat=directlink\"&gt;&lt;img border=\"0\" src=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-HCaopl1lEFI/UGGFBRl9R1I/AAAAAAABTwQ/nJ-965ciglE/s600/Teton%2520Grand%2520Slam%2520-%2520GE%2520-%25203,jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Our path for the Valhalla Traverse, seen from the West&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"https://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/y_8AfLk2Wr4raRmNElV-AtMTjNZETYmyPJy0liipFm0?feat=directlink\"&gt;&lt;img border=\"0\" src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-4SYo9avjrDM/UFQUy4UXKCI/AAAAAAABUuE/AzRelxnrR1w/s600/2012-08-30%2520-%252041%2520-%2520Valhalla%2520Traverse%2520Start%2520-%2520annotate,jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;The beginning of the Valhalla Traverse heading out from the Lower Saddle&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;hr&gt;\r\n&lt;hr&gt;\r\n&lt;h2&gt;\r\n&lt;a name=\"TOC-Heading-out-from-Camp\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Heading out from Camp&lt;/h2&gt;\r\nSteph and I woke early the next day, with gear packed for the multi-day carryover and the extra food, fuel, and luxuries packed separately to be left at the Lower Saddle as a cache.

At the very least I could see where a gear anchor could be made to belay the follower in to limit the consequences of falling on this crux. There was no anchor at our position, but there was a solid rock shaped well to be slung, so I slung the block and put Steph on belay. She downclimbed this slot (class 4?), placing a few solid pieces as she went. Although the guidebooks said \"belay anchors and protection are nearly impossible to obtain\", at least we were able to do so at the crux!

Beware of rockfall at this point.

The terrain we were on was also very steep and composed of loose rock and dirt. It seemed like it would be a major pain to put on crampons here for such a short crossing.&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"https://picasaweb.google.com/105894936663116565516/20120901TetonsWStephValhallaTraverseIICl4SteepIceSnow#5789732500226798050\"&gt;&lt;img border=\"0\" src=\"http://lh3.ggpht.com/-ilcbsUk3xHo/UFlDCJyNceI/AAAAAAABSvU/dCsHTCAUUkA/s600/2012-09-01%252520-%25252023a%252520-%252520Just%252520before%252520the%252520debris%252520chute%252520-%252520Steph,jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Taking a break before the ice traverse. (by Steph Abegg)&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\nI thought maybe we could just chop a few steps to quickly walk across and be done with the crossing. However, the ice was hard enough and the position awkward enough that it was difficult to chop steps very efficiently. Steph started looking for a way to climb the steeper rock above to where we could possibly just step over the ice. I expressed my doubts about going that way without being roped up, as it looked to be 4th class on extremely loose rock and we were already in steep terrain where falling would be very bad. &lt;/div&gt;\r\n&lt;div&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;/div&gt;\r\n&lt;div&gt;As I was expressing my doubts about Steph\'s strategy, a table-sized block of ice came tumbling down the narrow strip of ice! Well, after seeing that I agreed that it would be a bad idea to try the slow process of chopping steps. It also probably wouldn\'t be a good idea to rope up here, as stretching a rope across the debris chute now seemed like a bad idea. &lt;/div&gt;\r\n&lt;div&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;/div&gt;\r\n&lt;div&gt;Fortunately Steph found a way up that was reasonably solid if you were careful, and she was able to quickly step across the ice and run across the gully before stopping and waiting beneath the cover of the next set of tiered cliffs. I carefully climbed up and into position, during which time another large block of ice came falling down. Once I was in position, I stopped and listened to make sure nothing was coming down, and quickly stepped across and ran over to Steph as fast as I could. &lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\nThat guidebook certainly put the conditions of this traverse mildly!&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"https://picasaweb.google.com/105894936663116565516/20120901TetonsWStephValhallaTraverseIICl4SteepIceSnow#5789732560564435426\"&gt;&lt;img border=\"0\" src=\"http://lh4.ggpht.com/-gWBMcLLL6lU/UFlDFqj0ueI/AAAAAAABSvc/stDEPXNxj0A/s600/2012-09-01%252520-%25252023c%252520-%252520Crossing%252520the%252520debris%252520chute%252520-%252520Steph,jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Running away from the debris chute as fast as I can go.

We took note of this, and I traversed across and up towards Serendipity Arete to look for a bivy while Steph investigated a line closer to the water source. We both found excellent bivies, and decided that the ones Steph found were on the West Ledges route and mine was more along the Serendipity Arete route. &lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"https://picasaweb.google.com/105894936663116565516/20120901TetonsWStephValhallaTraverseIICl4SteepIceSnow#5787576206458782562\"&gt;&lt;img border=\"0\" src=\"http://lh5.ggpht.com/-uRJUZS5Lk54/UFGZ5Vh6g2I/AAAAAAABSv0/DXXFeaBpz2Q/s600/2012-09-01%252520-%25252029%252520-%252520The%252520Rabbit%252520Ears,jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Rabbit Ears, seen across Valhalla Canyon from camp&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\nSteph was about to go get water next, but as the swirling clouds were starting to look more ominous, I suggested we get the tent set up first just in case it rained. No sooner had I said that than it began to rain. We hurriedly put up the tent as the intensity increased, and hopped inside to take cover. The rain came down hard enough that is started to soak through the membrane of the First Light tent.

We laid gear back out to dry, and enjoyed our picturesque campsite, reading, relaxing, doing logic puzzles, and of course photography! One ongoing thing I was amused to find on this trip was that I was often taking photographs in Steph\'s direction as she was taking photographs, usually in my direction. It was rather funny to be inadvertently be playing a game of camera tag. This phenomena kept occurring throughout the trip as we both seemed to be in sync with our photo-taking habits.&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"https://picasaweb.google.com/105894936663116565516/20120901TetonsWStephValhallaTraverseIICl4SteepIceSnow#5787578775672796978\"&gt;&lt;img border=\"0\" src=\"http://lh6.ggpht.com/-awYT13ILGXY/UFGcO4mRNzI/AAAAAAABSw0/-1nLuf6d0rI/s600/2012-09-01%252520-%25252039%252520-%252520Photo%252520tag%252520with%252520Steph,jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Photo tag with Steph.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"https://picasaweb.google.com/105894936663116565516/20120901TetonsWStephValhallaTraverseIICl4SteepIceSnow#5787578855762673906\"&gt;&lt;img border=\"0\" src=\"http://lh3.ggpht.com/-5MGSRhjH0rQ/UFGcTi9LwPI/AAAAAAABSxU/Q9u5wgxhSPc/s600/2012-09-01%252520-%25252042%252520-%252520Steph%252520looking%252520over%252520Serendipity%252520Arete,jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Steph looking over Serendipity Arete.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"https://picasaweb.google.com/105894936663116565516/20120901TetonsWStephValhallaTraverseIICl4SteepIceSnow#5787578868706066114\"&gt;&lt;img border=\"0\" src=\"http://lh3.ggpht.com/-zBKjNZ5-QMo/UFGcUTLIPsI/AAAAAAABSxY/Da_ekI9wciY/s600/2012-09-01%252520-%25252043%252520-%252520Mt%252520Moran,jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Mt Moran&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\nThis day I took Steph up on her offer to try out one of her logic puzzles. While I still think I\'d want a book for some breaks, I found her puzzles to be very fun and engaging, and the size-to-time entertainment ratio of these little games printed out on paper trounced that of books. I\'ll have to remember to bring some of these along in the future on climbs in lieu of books (or at least bring fewer books).&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"https://picasaweb.google.com/105894936663116565516/20120901TetonsWStephValhallaTraverseIICl4SteepIceSnow#5789732790383608242\"&gt;&lt;img border=\"0\" src=\"http://lh5.ggpht.com/-MFjIGoWaQrs/UFlDTCs_AbI/AAAAAAABSxo/qM71yGntsCQ/s600/2012-09-01%252520-%25252046a%252520-%252520Doing%252520Logic%252520Puzzles%252520-%252520Steph,jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Steph has introduced me to logic puzzles!

Fortunately one of the key pieces of beta that I gleaned was that one should aim for starting the belayed pitches about one pitch below the gigantic corner and roof on the first tower. It was good we had this as a reference, as the annotated aerial photo in the Ortenburger &amp;amp; Jackson guide showed a completely incorrect line!&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-z4ioyBMkqDY/UFgYrvtGjCI/AAAAAAABUuc/ztMFahTOykA/s2000/2012-09-01%2520-%252027%2520-%2520Serendipity%2520Arete%2520%2526%2520Approach%2520-%2520annotated.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-z4ioyBMkqDY/UFgYrvtGjCI/AAAAAAABUuc/ztMFahTOykA/s600/2012-09-01%2520-%252027%2520-%2520Serendipity%2520Arete%2520%2526%2520Approach%2520-%2520annotated.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\nThe approach started out well enough. It seemed that all of the hail that had fallen the day and night before had melted . . . we hoped. The rock and grass was still a tad wet, but it seemed like we would have reasonable conditions. We headed partway up the next gully to the north of our camp, taking a line we had scouted the day before, and traversed out north onto ledges early on.&amp;Acirc;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"http://lh4.ggpht.com/-alg3LrKspaM/UFGiie4dmRI/AAAAAAABTJk/KT1OA6DgjnI/s2000/2012-09-02%252520-%25252014%252520-%252520Steph%252520starting%252520up%252520the%252520approach.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"http://lh4.ggpht.com/-alg3LrKspaM/UFGiie4dmRI/AAAAAAABTJk/KT1OA6DgjnI/s600/2012-09-02%252520-%25252014%252520-%252520Steph%252520starting%252520up%252520the%252520approach.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Steph starting up the approach.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\nThese ledges worked out well enough, but when the first main ledge pinched off into a class 3-4 chimney, I took off on the corner to the right. Based on what we had seen from camp the day before, and looking at the line drawn in the guidebook photo, we figured we stayed mostly to the right of the large corner until we came up to the first roped pitch. This idea dominated our routefinding strategy for the morning and led to us being off route for most of the time approaching the route.&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"http://lh5.ggpht.com/-BPRoOaQc7jQ/UFlMkxN8agI/AAAAAAABTJo/QUz4QZ54xNg/s2000/2012-09-02%252520-%25252014a%252520-%2525205th%252520class%252520groove%252520on%252520approach%252520-%252520Steph.JPG\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"http://lh5.ggpht.com/-BPRoOaQc7jQ/UFlMkxN8agI/AAAAAAABTJo/QUz4QZ54xNg/s600/2012-09-02%252520-%25252014a%252520-%2525205th%252520class%252520groove%252520on%252520approach%252520-%252520Steph.JPG\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Climbing off route up a slightly wet 5th class groove.

Steph wasn\'t feeling her wet slab soloing mojo this morning, so I dropped a coil of rope to belay her up past the crux. Was this really the way we should be going?&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"http://lh3.ggpht.com/--1QQ1suwwco/UFGijhkbzFI/AAAAAAABTJs/bldxJ9x1kn0/s2000/2012-09-02%252520-%25252015%252520-%252520Steph%252520on%252520off%252520route%2525205th%252520class.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"http://lh3.ggpht.com/--1QQ1suwwco/UFGijhkbzFI/AAAAAAABTJs/bldxJ9x1kn0/s600/2012-09-02%252520-%25252015%252520-%252520Steph%252520on%252520off%252520route%2525205th%252520class.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Steph climbing off route up a slightly wet 5th class groove.

Doh! We continued traversing far left, looking for the first reasonable line to cut up towards the next set of ledges. Eventually we found a break and I investigated. Then I roped up to simul climbg (clue), then decided I needed a full on belay (another clue). I climbed through terrain that felt more like 5.6-5.7 to me (yet more clues) until I was stymied by a corner that seemed to burly and insecure to climb with a pack (even more clues). Still, we had the idea in our minds that we needed to be switching back before heading too far north. Steph offered her suggestions on an alternate route, that upon inspection, turned out to be even worse. After 20 minutes or so of wasted time, I came down and we tried the idea of just following the ledge north until a definitively non-5th class way to reach the next ledge above us presented itself.&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"http://lh3.ggpht.com/-ErE5uc5G7A0/UFGikTXs5pI/AAAAAAABTJw/wEFkKCIIHVw/s2000/2012-09-02%252520-%25252016%252520-%252520The%252520Enclosure%252520Area%252520at%252520Sunrise.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"http://lh3.ggpht.com/-ErE5uc5G7A0/UFGikTXs5pI/AAAAAAABTJw/wEFkKCIIHVw/s600/2012-09-02%252520-%25252016%252520-%252520The%252520Enclosure%252520Area%252520at%252520Sunrise.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Sunrise on the Grand Teton and Enclosure.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"http://lh3.ggpht.com/-T4hY4s8hFtQ/UFGilgDPJJI/AAAAAAABTJ0/_EjPojCtv2U/s2000/2012-09-02%252520-%25252017%252520-%252520N%252520Face%252520%252526%252520Ridge%252520of%252520the%252520Grand%252520at%252520Sunrise.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"http://lh3.ggpht.com/-T4hY4s8hFtQ/UFGilgDPJJI/AAAAAAABTJ0/_EjPojCtv2U/s600/2012-09-02%252520-%25252017%252520-%252520N%252520Face%252520%252526%252520Ridge%252520of%252520the%252520Grand%252520at%252520Sunrise.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;North Face and North Ridge of the Grand Teton at sunrise.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"http://lh5.ggpht.com/-LkWLLdI1c5k/UFGimZaOK4I/AAAAAAABTJ4/yE1IeE7dqWU/s2000/2012-09-02%252520-%25252018%252520-%252520Table%252520Mountain%252520at%252520Sunrise.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"http://lh5.ggpht.com/-LkWLLdI1c5k/UFGimZaOK4I/AAAAAAABTJ4/yE1IeE7dqWU/s600/2012-09-02%252520-%25252018%252520-%252520Table%252520Mountain%252520at%252520Sunrise.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Table Mountain at sunrise.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\nThis alpine stuff is a lot harder when you can\'t see the terrain due to perspective, and there is virtually no information (or incorrect information) for choosing your line! &amp;Acirc;&amp;nbsp;After wasting so much time on the 5th class groove, and the harder 5th class dead end, we decided to play it safe and just routefind as we went, rather than trying to make our route fit our preconceived notions. This ended up working much better. We traversed much farther north than expected, but found an easy way up to the next ledge. Then we traversed much farther south than expected before finding the next break to the next ledge. Oh well. Although we were traversing much more than we were ascending, at least we were moving much more continuously.&amp;Acirc;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"http://lh5.ggpht.com/-l-t0_uf0Kbk/UFGinbheU-I/AAAAAAABTJ8/160yFEFRYC4/s2000/2012-09-02%252520-%25252019%252520-%252520Approaching%252520the%252520route.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"http://lh5.ggpht.com/-l-t0_uf0Kbk/UFGinbheU-I/AAAAAAABTJ8/160yFEFRYC4/s600/2012-09-02%252520-%25252019%252520-%252520Approaching%252520the%252520route.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Still approaching the route, trying to keep the climbing easier.

While the information on MountainProject was helpful in suggesting to aim for ending up below the large roof and corner, more directly beneath a long, thin, black roof, we felt that another good landmark to refine routefinding is to aim for the \'triangular\' roof just beneath the thin, black roof, as the first pitch belay starts in a corner at the north end of this roof.&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"http://lh3.ggpht.com/-krVj7CH3Ut0/UFGiu1_unmI/AAAAAAABTKY/XaagTlha4is/s2000/2012-09-02%252520-%25252026%252520-%252520Almost%252520to%252520the%252520proper%252520start.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"http://lh3.ggpht.com/-krVj7CH3Ut0/UFGiu1_unmI/AAAAAAABTKY/XaagTlha4is/s600/2012-09-02%252520-%25252026%252520-%252520Almost%252520to%252520the%252520proper%252520start.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Final exposed traverse to the proper start, which turned out be be in the corner beneath the sloping roof.

I also took some time to rewarm my hands, as there was a constant wind blowing, that coupled with the occasional grabbing of snow, ice, and more often very cold rock, left my hands numb and in need of some painful re-thawing. Steph was doing fairly well, though, as a friend of hers had recently given her a secret weapon - the blue gardening gloves of power, which gave her enhanced grip while maintaining warmth in her fingers without too much loss of dexterity. I was jealous as I only had thin, slippery liners that I often had to remove for the tougher climbing.

Also, although the sun was rising and the landscape all around us was brightening, we would be shaded by Mt. Owen for a good while longer and we had too much terrain to climb to allow the luxury of letting the sun come to us. I would just have to tough it out and climb as much as I could in my glove liners, and then take them off for the harder climbing and race through it to the next rest stance to rewarm my hands.

Some people belay here, but I decided to follow the descriptions that had me ascend the next corner first. I actually found this corner to be the crux of the climb after the 5.9 OW finishing pitch. You must climb a hand crack in the corner, and it is reminiscent of a classic Indian Creek splitter. The problem is that it was a little too tight for me to get my palm in, and the corner flared for the first 5 ft with slick, featureless walls, so basically I had no feet and was starting on what felt like a slight overhang. I threw a red cam in high, shoved my hand in as deep as it would go, crimped to hold it, and kicked my feet against the walls as I pulled up on the jams and dynamically bumped then up a few times until the crack widened enough to get a more solid, passive jam. &amp;Acirc;&amp;nbsp;I threw in another piece, moved a few more tiring moves up, and at last I could get my feet in the crack! From here it was easy jamming and some tricky stemming and awkward squeezing to finish the pitch.&lt;/div&gt;\r\n&lt;div&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"http://lh3.ggpht.com/-TfE6PgPAdUY/UFGi-lzfxrI/AAAAAAABTLo/yqeqV-5FHcA/s2000/2012-09-02%252520-%25252037a%252520-%252520P2%252520crux%252520corner.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"http://lh3.ggpht.com/-TfE6PgPAdUY/UFGi-lzfxrI/AAAAAAABTLo/yqeqV-5FHcA/s600/2012-09-02%252520-%25252037a%252520-%252520P2%252520crux%252520corner.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Turning the corner on P2.

You can belay here or continue up the corner (jamcrack and chimney) to a nice, protected ledge.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\nAlthough this section was shown to be 5.7 in the topo, I really felt like it should be rated 5.8+ or even 5.9. While my pack did make things harder, Steph had the benefit of smaller hands and a top rope and also felt that it was much harder than 5.7. At the very least, we both felt that this section was significantly harder than any of the other 5.7 on the route. It was a great crack, nonetheless.&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"http://lh5.ggpht.com/-MZ0P6NpQzpQ/UFGjAn95E9I/AAAAAAABTLw/3f45GbGw76c/s2000/2012-09-02%252520-%25252038%252520-%252520Steph%252520following%252520up%252520P2.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"http://lh5.ggpht.com/-MZ0P6NpQzpQ/UFGjAn95E9I/AAAAAAABTLw/3f45GbGw76c/s600/2012-09-02%252520-%25252038%252520-%252520Steph%252520following%252520up%252520P2.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Steph following up the last bit of P2.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\nThe information on the next pitch was a bit ambiguous and the topo was wrong (I am making an improved topo for the climb). From our ledge I tunneled through a class 3 chimney to an even larger ledge that was beneath a 30\' slab, bordered by an offwidth. There were no cracks except for the offwidth, and alas we didn\'t bring our Valley Giants. The face was featured enough to appear reasonable to face climb, staying mostly alongside the offwidth.

This wind was very strange. Rather than it feeling like it was stripping away heat, the actual blowing air mass felt frigid. Also, the wind was either fully on or off. One minute it would be calm, with the sun gradually warming us, then like a switch being turned, the wind blast would return, roaring across our bodies for anywhere between the next minute to thirty minutes before there would be a short break. Still, discomfort goes hand in hand with alpine climbing, so we enjoyed the warmth when it came, and then bundled up and climbed faster when it departed.&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"http://lh4.ggpht.com/-bUQuNP7BcYM/UFGjmGu-F4I/AAAAAAABTOE/BZ3YOg8ijYU/s2000/2012-09-02%252520-%25252063%252520-%252520Steph%252520in%252520Rope%252520Blanket%252520for%252520P7.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"http://lh4.ggpht.com/-bUQuNP7BcYM/UFGjmGu-F4I/AAAAAAABTOE/BZ3YOg8ijYU/s600/2012-09-02%252520-%25252063%252520-%252520Steph%252520in%252520Rope%252520Blanket%252520for%252520P7.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Steph in her rope blanket, ready to belay P7.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\nThe next pitch was supposed to be 5.6 (according to Mountainproject, or unlisted in our other topos), and was supposed to take the crest directly. The easiest line veered off the crest (it seemed to me), and it seemed harder than 5.6 (to both me and Steph). It had some interesting face climbing moves with decking potential - classic alpine.

It seems silly to call this entire feature the 4th Tower, as it is larger than the 2nd, 3rd, and 4th combined. Also, sources ambiguously call the lower hump the 4th tower, but I\'m going to insist on labeling the high point the 4th Tower. The scrambling over to it is much shorter than the next 5.7 pitch than depicted on the topos.&amp;Acirc;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"http://lh3.ggpht.com/-Cx7d8tqYkNA/UFGjs9OqC9I/AAAAAAABTOg/xBb10E9YcRY/s2000/2012-09-02%252520-%25252067%252520-%2525204th%252520Tower.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"http://lh3.ggpht.com/-Cx7d8tqYkNA/UFGjs9OqC9I/AAAAAAABTOg/xBb10E9YcRY/s600/2012-09-02%252520-%25252067%252520-%2525204th%252520Tower.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Fourth Tower, beginning P8, which is really just a cl. 2-3 walk over to the tower and a bit around the left side of the crest.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\nEasy 2nd class walking brought be around the corner.

I followed up and over the 4th Tower and down into a large notch. Here our information indicated a bypass option, but I was feeling good and set upon finishing this climb properly. This final pitch was listed as 5.7 A1 or 5.9 chimney or stem. Somehow it seemed like none of this to me. It was no the last pitch, it would go at 5.7 C0 if you brought micronuts and were more gutsy &amp;amp; adept at aiding off of them than free climbing a short offwidth, and the crux itself presented no stemming or chimneying except as an afterthought.

Owen to the Grandstand of the Grand Teton. This section is the routefinding crux of the Cathedral Traverse and one of the technical cruxes (if I recall correctly), so we expected a challenging day finding our way to the Grandstand. We had hoped to combine this traverse with Serendipity Arete the day before, but the long, tiring nature of Serendipity, combined with cold conditions, slowed us up enough that we stopped early.&amp;Acirc;&amp;nbsp;\r\n&lt;div&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;/div&gt;\r\n&lt;div&gt;Steph and I discussed the possibility of climbing the North Ridge the same day as the traverse, as the traverse should only take a few hours, but we decided that we would most likely take our time and stop early on the Grandstand. We didn\'t want to risk getting partway up the North Ridge and run out of daylight. Also, we could see snow and ice on the ledges of the Grand, and we hoped that another day of clear weather and sunshine would melt it off enough to make the route more reasonable to climb.&lt;/div&gt;\r\n&lt;div&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;/div&gt;\r\n&lt;div&gt;It took us about 3 hours to climb from the summit area of Mt Owen to the Gunsight, and another 3 hours to gain the top of the Grandstand. Expect faster times if you don\'t get ropes stuck on rappel, travel lighter, and know where you are going.&lt;/div&gt;\r\n&lt;div&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"https://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/RDNz6F5dEvHeEHwU_o4swNMTjNZETYmyPJy0liipFm0?feat=directlink\"&gt;&lt;img border=\"0\" src=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-QP3DXiQZil8/UGGE2qiGW6I/AAAAAAABTvg/ESsGR93J9H8/s600/Teton%2520Grand%2520Slam%2520-%2520GE%2520-%25205.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Traversing from Owen to the Grandstand&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"https://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/OLqZviplt5Vdz-XpChKrDdMTjNZETYmyPJy0liipFm0?feat=directlink\"&gt;&lt;img border=\"0\" src=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-Z4SO4BSit4A/UFbED_fMdpI/AAAAAAABUwA/1FxDt9KmCUI/s600/2012-09-03%2520-%252037%2520-%2520Mt%2520Owen%2520%2526%2520Steph%2520-%2520annotated.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Descending from Mt.

There was no water here, but one could probably reach the permanent snowfields lower down on the Koven Route easily enough.&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"https://picasaweb.google.com/105894936663116565516/20120903TetonsWStephOwenToGrandstandII5735Rappels#5787582300430693058\"&gt;&lt;img border=\"0\" src=\"http://lh4.ggpht.com/-pKeHYn_15Nc/UFGfcDWCcsI/AAAAAAABTnM/-garuxR2aWU/s600/2012-09-03%252520-%25252005%252520-%252520Dowleading%2525205_4%252520chimney.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Downleading the 5.4 chimney.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"https://picasaweb.google.com/105894936663116565516/20120903TetonsWStephOwenToGrandstandII5735Rappels#5787582327284130610\"&gt;&lt;img border=\"0\" src=\"http://lh5.ggpht.com/-WVqW-v7KfGk/UFGfdnYZYzI/AAAAAAABTnQ/fU8022YPfSE/s600/2012-09-03%252520-%25252006%252520-%252520Steph%252520downfollowing%252520the%2525205_4%252520chimney.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Steph downfollowing the 5.4 chimney.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\nSteph followed down the chimney as we traversed along the main ledge system.

Basically, just keep traversing the big ledge. You downclimb a couple of class 3 steps and then you reach a dramatic dropoff before a large tower. You can\'t miss this. &amp;Acirc;&amp;nbsp;From here it is supposedly a steep and improbable class 4 downclimb into the notch. I say supposedly because there was also a nice and well maintained rappel station here and we chose to take that option. It is a short, single rope rappel to the notch from here.&lt;/div&gt;\r\n&lt;div&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;/div&gt;\r\n&lt;div&gt;The downclimb appears to be steep and tricky for the first 20 ft before reaching a large slabby ledge about halfway down. From here the rest of the downclimb is easy if you pick the right way off the slab. I know this because our rope got stuck when we pulled it and I climbed back up to free it - the rope had stuck itself wrapped around a rock projecting up on the slabby ledge section.&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"https://picasaweb.google.com/105894936663116565516/20120903TetonsWStephOwenToGrandstandII5735Rappels#5789747181100807170\"&gt;&lt;img border=\"0\" src=\"http://lh5.ggpht.com/-uHd0LF3Ku7I/UFlQYsTVNAI/AAAAAAABTno/KLM2XhveJoU/s600/2012-09-03%252520-%25252009b%252520-%252520Rapelling%252520before%252520the%252520tower%252520-%252520Steph.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Rappelling into the West Ledges route just before the tower.

This part could be OK to downclimb, with the crux being this first part. (by Steph Abegg)&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\nAfter the rappel we remained unroped and began downclimbing the West Ledges routes. As we crossed the crest the comfortable morning temperatures dropped as we traded our calm sunny aspect for the shaded windy one. The presence of snow on the ledges on this side reminded us that the shaded aspects still had tricky conditions. Hopefully one more day of melting would take care of this.&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"https://picasaweb.google.com/105894936663116565516/20120903TetonsWStephOwenToGrandstandII5735Rappels#5787582499067893298\"&gt;&lt;img border=\"0\" src=\"http://lh5.ggpht.com/-B1pU27y98C8/UFGfnnU1ljI/AAAAAAABTnw/5vPBqsobISM/s600/2012-09-03%252520-%25252011%252520-%252520Downclimbing%252520the%252520West%252520Ledges.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Downclimbing the West Ledges route.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\nThe West Ledges downclimb is steep and junky. We eventually found ourselves on the north side of the large chute, and here the terrain became steep and thin again. There was enough ice and snow here that we were happy to use another rappel station we had found rather than trying to solo or simul climb down this section. One 70m rappel got us past this crux (a 60m could work too).&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"https://picasaweb.google.com/105894936663116565516/20120903TetonsWStephOwenToGrandstandII5735Rappels#5789747221649485042\"&gt;&lt;img border=\"0\" src=\"http://lh6.ggpht.com/-vr5TqDoewos/UFlQbDW47PI/AAAAAAABTn0/fbpF35OiABI/s600/2012-09-03%252520-%25252011a%252520-%252520Second%252520Rapp%252520on%252520W%252520Ledges%252520-%252520Steph.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Second rappell.

From here it is three rappels into the Gunsight Notch. The first one is a short single rope rappel and swings a bit to rappeler\'s left.

We messed this one up. You begin on a platform and can choose a variety of seemingly feasible directions off of the rappel. The rings were pointed about 45 degrees to the left (East), and as we were planning on traversing out East onto the Grandstand, we figured this must be the way to go.&amp;Acirc;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"https://picasaweb.google.com/105894936663116565516/20120903TetonsWStephOwenToGrandstandII5735Rappels#5790089898470914002\"&gt;&lt;img border=\"0\" src=\"http://lh3.ggpht.com/-B3oLXqRo6XA/UFqIFd_vt9I/AAAAAAABTtg/XIWvdBt5ovI/s600/2012-09-03%252520-%25252016a%252520-%252520Starting%252520Notch%252520Rapp%2525203%252520-%252520Steph%252520-%252520annotated.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Last rappel into Gunsight Notch (by Steph Abegg)&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\nI started down and came across some extremely loose and fractured rock. I swung rappeller\'s left onto better rock to avoid knocking it onto my face. The farther down I went, the more I tried to traverse left, but I was around the corner of this pedestal and the rope limited me in how far back left I could tension. As I dropped down the final steep section, I could see that the ropes didn\'t reach the bottom! I tensioned left even harder and could barely get them to reach. However, the Gunsight had trickier conditions on the East side than I had expected. The entire section east of the notch was filled with very steep ice and snow and a big fall waiting below.&lt;/div&gt;\r\n&lt;div&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;/div&gt;\r\n&lt;div&gt;By this time I couldn\'t swing over to the Notch and had to rappel down into the chute before figuring out how to solve this predicament.

I tied a backup knot in the end and awkwardly tried to climb up to the notch, yarding on the rope until I reached rock. I tried climbing the rock, which was so junky that halfway up a large hold pulled, sending me back down the couloir onto a backflop and swing into the wall. Aaag! At least I had a backup knot.&lt;/div&gt;\r\n&lt;div&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;/div&gt;\r\n&lt;div&gt;Next strategy was to get to a very small platform just level enough to stand on. I could barely make a two-piece anchor with a #0 C3 and a small nut, so I did this to get off rappel. I then directed Steph to flip the rope so that she could rappel directly down to the notch, which she did piece of cake (doh!). She fixed the rope to a piece in the notch as a directional and to lessen bounce in the rope, and I tried climbing back up the rope. This time I knew not to trust the rock, so I jugged up with my belay device in guide mode, tying more frequent backup knots, stemming on the loose rock and carefully stepping around the large, loose sandy blocks capping the top of the chute.&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"https://picasaweb.google.com/105894936663116565516/20120903TetonsWStephOwenToGrandstandII5735Rappels#5789747346605275154\"&gt;&lt;img border=\"0\" src=\"http://lh5.ggpht.com/-U07TCVkIgOQ/UFlQiU2q-BI/AAAAAAABTok/G5y1TBYPDP0/s600/2012-09-03%252520-%25252016ca%252520-%252520Jugging%252520back%252520up%252520to%252520Notch%252520-%252520Steph.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Jugging up to the Gunsight Notch using my belay device in guide mode while being delicate stemming around the death blocks.

Rock in the Gunsight Notch is extremely rotten, but fortunately you are on solid rock very quickly.&lt;/div&gt;\r\n&lt;div&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"https://picasaweb.google.com/105894936663116565516/20120903TetonsWStephOwenToGrandstandII5735Rappels#5789747370089540866\"&gt;&lt;img border=\"0\" src=\"http://lh4.ggpht.com/-uKWT3pCgdCE/UFlQjsVwbQI/AAAAAAABTo4/Ne2qGFQAWwo/s600/2012-09-03%252520-%25252020a%252520-%252520At%252520start%252520of%252520Notch%252520Pitch%252520-%252520Steph.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;At the start of the Gunsight Notch Pitch, by a piton.

(by Steph Abegg)&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\nI stopped and belayed Steph up at a piton. From here it is less clear exactly where to go and the terrain is very steep, but the rock is very good and I could see a lot of potential options to explore. Still, the pitch is not straightforward, so take care with your routefinding.&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"https://picasaweb.google.com/105894936663116565516/20120903TetonsWStephOwenToGrandstandII5735Rappels#5787582648140496370\"&gt;&lt;img border=\"0\" src=\"http://lh3.ggpht.com/-tGJvmIzJWsA/UFGfwSqg_fI/AAAAAAABToo/AVIEbZY_Pz0/s600/2012-09-03%252520-%25252017%252520-%252520Steep%2525205_7%252520out%252520of%252520notch%252520to%252520other%252520notch.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Steep 5.7 climb out of the Gunsight Notch. As per the Ortenburger guide, climb into a notch on the Grandstand, up good rock. This was a fun, but not trivial pitch.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\nThe terrain above the piton looked too hard, so I went left a short ways and did a physical, bouldery move to the top of a large, projecting block, from which I could get in my first piece. From here I launched up steep climbing that was mostly face and occasionally in cracks. I stepped right to a different line of cracks and grooves for better protection opportunities until that section steepened before the end. From there I made a thin, crux face traverse back left into easy cracks that took me to a notch where I belayed Steph up.&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"https://picasaweb.google.com/105894936663116565516/20120903TetonsWStephOwenToGrandstandII5735Rappels#5789747380098121426\"&gt;&lt;img border=\"0\" src=\"http://lh6.ggpht.com/-xOnm-aOjgS8/UFlQkRn_PtI/AAAAAAABTo8/SLYU_bmA02s/s600/2012-09-03%252520-%25252020b%252520-%252520Leading%252520Notch%252520Pitch%252520-%252520Steph.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Beginning the lead up the Gunsight Notch Pitch.

We lost some time as Steph traversed too high, we think, as going lower down appeared in retrospect to be more straightforward. From here we unroped and started scrambling the 300-400 ft of class 3-4 to the top of the Grandstand.&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"https://picasaweb.google.com/105894936663116565516/20120903TetonsWStephOwenToGrandstandII5735Rappels#5787582763317597330\"&gt;&lt;img border=\"0\" src=\"http://lh5.ggpht.com/-sfNlKGKgfzQ/UFGf2_u4FJI/AAAAAAABTpE/tsyoL4r8FEA/s600/2012-09-03%252520-%25252022%252520-%252520Steph%252520coiling%252520rope%252520on%252520thhe%252520Grandstand.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Steph coiling the rope on the Grandstand.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"https://picasaweb.google.com/105894936663116565516/20120903TetonsWStephOwenToGrandstandII5735Rappels#5787582807336874002\"&gt;&lt;img border=\"0\" src=\"http://lh4.ggpht.com/-E0JW5OLwaps/UFGf5jt48BI/AAAAAAABTpM/RwG3cvrgMko/s600/2012-09-03%252520-%25252024%252520-%252520N%252520Face%252520from%252520the%252520Grandstand.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;North Face of the Grand Teton seen from the Grand Stand.

Very comfy! Steph said this terrain reminded her of a lot of the Northern Cascades. We traversed on the ledge until we were near the intersection of the Grandstand and the North Face of the Grand Teton. Here the cliffs to our right opened up into lower angle slabs, snow, and scree slopes. The slabs were wet here and there, which made for some interesting scrambling moments.&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"https://picasaweb.google.com/105894936663116565516/20120903TetonsWStephOwenToGrandstandII5735Rappels#5787582898311683410\"&gt;&lt;img border=\"0\" src=\"http://lh3.ggpht.com/-v6XdoE-GbXM/UFGf-2n-XVI/AAAAAAABTpY/9RRe9VO3YHU/s600/2012-09-03%252520-%25252027%252520-%252520Steph%252520on%252520cl%2525203%252520terrain%252520on%252520the%252520Grandstand.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Steph on cl. 3 terrain on the Grandstand.

Even with the dry winter and the late season, there was still some snow and even running meltwater on this final section, which allowed for convenient water gathering. We set up camp on a spot just barely large enough for the tent, and Steph took off for an hour water gathering outing (note - other parties might want to refill water on their way up, as the running water source for us was about halfway back down where we had come).&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"https://picasaweb.google.com/105894936663116565516/20120903TetonsWStephOwenToGrandstandII5735Rappels#5789747397601849410\"&gt;&lt;img border=\"0\" src=\"http://lh3.ggpht.com/-XzGGdQ6SVtE/UFlQlS1M8EI/AAAAAAABTp0/Gy_7OMEI0D4/s600/2012-09-03%252520-%25252033a%252520-%252520Me%252520at%252520Grandstand%252520Camp%252520-%252520Steph.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;At the Grandstand Camp.

I could see icicles hanging on the shaded faces near the alcove where I believed the Chockstone Chimney to be. As the sun heated the face we could occasionally here this ice detach from the rock and crash down the face. Today is definitely a day to relax at the Grandstand! Most of the face looked dry, so we hoped that maybe one more day of melting would make the route reasonable. Still, I worried about the bits of ice that I could see trickled down here and there on some of the face climbing sections . . .&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"https://picasaweb.google.com/105894936663116565516/20120903TetonsWStephOwenToGrandstandII5735Rappels#5789747414612648242\"&gt;&lt;img border=\"0\" src=\"http://lh4.ggpht.com/-upbKJpHspdo/UFlQmSM5ITI/AAAAAAABTp8/4G2BNxw332c/s600/2012-09-03%252520-%25252034a%252520-%252520Making%252520Topos%252520-%252520Steph.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Making topos of our wanderings to pass the time.

years ago, the North Ridge of the Grand Teton remains today one of the great classic mountaineering routes in the range, a tribute to the vision and skill of the first -ascent party. At the time of its first ascent, this route was perhaps the most difficult climb in the country. This route, which averages over 63&amp;Acirc;&amp;deg; for 1,200 feet, is better described as the intersection of two high-angle faces than as a ridge; \r\n\r\nEven the climb up to the top of the Grandstand is not trivial.\" \r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n &amp;Acirc;&amp;nbsp; &amp;Acirc;&amp;nbsp; &amp;Acirc;&amp;nbsp; - Ortenburger &amp;amp; Jackson, A Climber\'s Guide to the Tetons\r\n&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;\r\n&lt;/td&gt;\r\n&lt;/tr&gt;\r\n&lt;/tbody&gt;\r\n&lt;/table&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\nInspiring quotes like this one are what have kindled my interest and fascination of climbing the impressive and historic routes of the North Face and North Ridge of the Grand Teton. After gaining the Grandstand the day prior, and looking down the other possible approaches to it, I\'d have to say that one thing that really sets the North Ridge apart is its isolation. One must work quite hard just to get to the start of this great route, and from there one is quite committed to finishing it.&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;hr&gt;\r\n&lt;h2&gt;\r\n&lt;a name=\"TOC-Cold-Start-and-the-Lower-Pitches\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Cold Start and the Lower Pitches&lt;/h2&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"http://lh3.ggpht.com/-8DWCy9fCq7Q/UFGcb2GOtxI/AAAAAAABSyM/zrA5FZLONSg/s2000/2012-09-04%252520-%25252001%252520-%252520Sunrise%252520over%252520Teewinot.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"http://lh3.ggpht.com/-8DWCy9fCq7Q/UFGcb2GOtxI/AAAAAAABSyM/zrA5FZLONSg/s600/2012-09-04%252520-%25252001%252520-%252520Sunrise%252520over%252520Teewinot.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Sunrise over Mt Teewinot.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\nAnother early day in the Tetons. Somehow even though we were camped a couple hundred feet lower at the Grandstand than the night prior on Mt. Owen, the last night felts significantly colder. Leaving our tent, we also noticed that it seemed significantly windier too. It was time to get moving!&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"http://lh4.ggpht.com/-NEZlnW88Z9c/UFGccyWL1qI/AAAAAAABSyQ/JbmEyblkMmU/s2000/2012-09-04%252520-%25252002%252520-%252520Sunrise%252520on%252520the%252520N%252520Ridge.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"http://lh4.ggpht.com/-NEZlnW88Z9c/UFGccyWL1qI/AAAAAAABSyQ/JbmEyblkMmU/s600/2012-09-04%252520-%25252002%252520-%252520Sunrise%252520on%252520the%252520N%252520Ridge.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Sunrise on the North Ridge, seen from camp.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\nI scoped out the 100\' approach from our tent to the start of the route the day prior to make sure we took the best line there in the morning (thus far we\'ve had a habit of starting out off route). We walked along the knife edge to a notch to rope up. Oddly there was a cache here of crampons and climbing boots . . .&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"http://lh6.ggpht.com/-_48kRebn2pY/UFGcgLhkDCI/AAAAAAABSyY/EZO926dV8nw/s2000/2012-09-04%252520-%25252004%252520-%252520Climber%252520Cache.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"http://lh6.ggpht.com/-_48kRebn2pY/UFGcgLhkDCI/AAAAAAABSyY/EZO926dV8nw/s600/2012-09-04%252520-%25252004%252520-%252520Climber%252520Cache.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Help! I\'ve fallen and I can\'t get up!&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\nLooking at the topo, pitch 1 had a flake that one must tunnel behind. It is very hard to pick out the flake directly as it blends into the wall, but the day before we figured we had it identified. Since I was worried about tunneling through with a large pack on, I tried a more direct, but probably more difficult line, that avoided the tunnel through. It was more like 5.6-5.7 rather than class 4. I climbed the short face section in the howling wind, then stopped beside the flake to get some feeling back into my hands. Looking to my right it appeared that the tunnel through is plenty large to go through with a pack. Oh well! At least my variation probably saved me a lot of rope drag.&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"http://lh6.ggpht.com/-RLQRcs9l2UE/UFGch8oJG7I/AAAAAAABSyc/hYzf3sEt-H0/s2000/2012-09-04%252520-%25252005%252520-%252520Detached%252520flake%252520I%252520should%252520have%252520tunneled%252520through.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"http://lh6.ggpht.com/-RLQRcs9l2UE/UFGch8oJG7I/AAAAAAABSyc/hYzf3sEt-H0/s600/2012-09-04%252520-%25252005%252520-%252520Detached%252520flake%252520I%252520should%252520have%252520tunneled%252520through.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Detached flake on P1 that I should have tunneled through. I wasn\'t sure if I would fit with my carryover pack, so I took a harder, direct line to bypass this, but it was pretty wide.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\nAfter a bit of moaning as the pain ebbed from my hands, I had gotten enough dexterity back to attack the next short headwall. I raced up before my hands could get too numb again. More 5.7 face climbing with a piton to start. After this the terrain eases and I could climb in gloves again. I went beyond the standard belay and halfway through the next pitch before stopping at a belay around the corner.&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"http://lh6.ggpht.com/-zH5W5jPQu58/UFlWWOIQoqI/AAAAAAABSyg/4VXj7mEuarQ/s2000/2012-09-04%252520-%25252005a%252520-%252520Leading%252520past%252520detached%252520flake%252520on%252520P1%252520-%252520Steph.JPG\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"http://lh6.ggpht.com/-zH5W5jPQu58/UFlWWOIQoqI/AAAAAAABSyg/4VXj7mEuarQ/s600/2012-09-04%252520-%25252005a%252520-%252520Leading%252520past%252520detached%252520flake%252520on%252520P1%252520-%252520Steph.JPG\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Leading past the detached flake on P1.

I could tell this section and the next pitch would be trivial in normal conditions, but the cold and the surprising amount of snow cover made it much trickier and I moved as slowly here as on harder pitches.&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"http://lh3.ggpht.com/-CVrxCzL6vYc/UFGckrPDJwI/AAAAAAABSyo/7gpXtOQ0KNI/s2000/2012-09-04%252520-%25252007%252520-%252520P2%252520Easy%252520pitch%252520gets%252520less%252520easy.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"http://lh3.ggpht.com/-CVrxCzL6vYc/UFGckrPDJwI/AAAAAAABSyo/7gpXtOQ0KNI/s600/2012-09-04%252520-%25252007%252520-%252520P2%252520Easy%252520pitch%252520gets%252520less%252520easy.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;P2 easy pitch gets less easy.

As I crested the chute into the alcove beneath the 5.8 pitch, I found most of the terrain covered in snow. As I climbed the last 20 ft up to the rock wall to make an anchor, the snow became more consolidated into ice. I couldn\'t even kick steps in it, and instead had to smear carefully and try to find little indentations and rocks sticking out to make it to the end.

Neither guidebook made similar warnings about other routes. Naturally this left me apprehensive about climbing on. Specifically, the pitch after the chimneys is a 5.7 friction slab that apparently ices up.&lt;/div&gt;\r\n&lt;div&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;/div&gt;\r\n&lt;div&gt;I belayed Steph up and told her my concerns. However, I happened to have brought along a topo and beta for the Italian Cracks Variation. It avoided the chimneys and slab pitch, so I thought maybe it would be doable in these conditions. Also, it was on the sunny and leeward side of the crest, so it would be much more bearable to climb. Steph agreed that this would be a good way to go.&lt;/div&gt;\r\n&lt;div&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;/div&gt;\r\n&lt;div&gt;I also voiced my wondering about us bailing, but Steph pointed out that considering how remote the top of the Grandstand is, the serious nature of reversing from the Grandstand might scarcely be less sketchy than pressing on. Plus then we would have to hike back up Garnet Canyon to retrieve our camp. Up and over the Grand would probably be the easiest and least sketchy way to go from here. We agreed to dismiss this option so long as it was reasonable to tentatively climb higher into the next pitches.&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"http://lh4.ggpht.com/-Qrvc_h6OJA8/UFGcoLQqUcI/AAAAAAABSy4/7qbiQKk0Kxk/s2000/2012-09-04%252520-%25252010%252520-%252520P3%252520escape%252520to%252520Italian%252520Cracks.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"http://lh4.ggpht.com/-Qrvc_h6OJA8/UFGcoLQqUcI/AAAAAAABSy4/7qbiQKk0Kxk/s600/2012-09-04%252520-%25252010%252520-%252520P3%252520escape%252520to%252520Italian%252520Cracks.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;P3 escape to the Italian Cracks variation.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\nI carefully climbed the icy slabs left on a wide ledge and over the top to a low 5th class jam crack, taking care to place more pro here to protect Steph on the downclimb.&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"http://lh6.ggpht.com/-PJFf57dy4gs/UFGcpk3WFmI/AAAAAAABSy8/qFDL8HL4IeQ/s2000/2012-09-04%252520-%25252011%252520-%252520P3%252520escape%252520to%252520Italian%252520Cracks%252520downclimb%252520other%252520side.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"http://lh6.ggpht.com/-PJFf57dy4gs/UFGcpk3WFmI/AAAAAAABSy8/qFDL8HL4IeQ/s600/2012-09-04%252520-%25252011%252520-%252520P3%252520escape%252520to%252520Italian%252520Cracks%252520downclimb%252520other%252520side.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;A steep downclimb on the P3 escape to the Italian Cracks variation, which was around the corner in sunlight, somewhat shielded by the fierce winds.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\nI continued traversing around the corner into sunlight and cleared a dry patch out of the now on the now sunny ledge at the base of the first real pitch of the Italian Cracks.

I was still very cold, but my hand numbness seemed more manageable now that I was on sunny, dry rock and mostly shielded from the wind. Still, I was feeling pretty tired, so at the base of the next corner I stopped short to make an early belay. We might as well save our strength on this.&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"http://lh4.ggpht.com/-yW6dm2BNxVI/UFGcs9pfncI/AAAAAAABSzY/cz4Cub2iWGY/s2000/2012-09-04%252520-%25252014%252520-%252520P4%252520part%2525202.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"http://lh4.ggpht.com/-yW6dm2BNxVI/UFGcs9pfncI/AAAAAAABSzY/cz4Cub2iWGY/s600/2012-09-04%252520-%25252014%252520-%252520P4%252520part%2525202.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;I stopped short for a rest and belay in the sunshine.

(5.7 roof to finish).&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\nThis next pitch was very sustained at 5.5-5.6 with lots of quality stemming. There was a roof at the end, but it didn\'t feel that much harder to me than the rest of the pitch. I\'d call it all 5.6+ to 5.7ish. According to the route info I had, I stopped and belayed just after in a little alcove, just beneath a larger cavern.&lt;/div&gt;\r\n&lt;div&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;/div&gt;\r\n&lt;div&gt;The MountainProject description said you could reach the Second Ledge in one long pitch of 5.7 face climbing from here (described as having intermittent cracks for pro), while the Ortenburger topo showed 2 pitches of face climbing, heading out right from the crack and then angling back left and heading straight up to the Second Ledge. So from the alcove I started climbing out right.&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"http://lh5.ggpht.com/-IXetGrQC1Ko/UFGcv7ekuJI/AAAAAAABSzg/KXkXVZY4D_8/s2000/2012-09-04%252520-%25252016%252520-%252520P5%252520face%252520climbing.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"http://lh5.ggpht.com/-IXetGrQC1Ko/UFGcv7ekuJI/AAAAAAABSzg/KXkXVZY4D_8/s600/2012-09-04%252520-%25252016%252520-%252520P5%252520face%252520climbing.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;P5 belay (our P6), looking at the 5.7 face climbing crux. This had ice on it, and the intermittent cracks were pretty far apart. I traversed a lot to the right with ledge fall consequences looking for cracks for pro that were clear of ice.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\nThere was a small ledge about 10-15\' beneath me, and all of the \'intermittent\' cracks I traversed too turned out to be grooves. I was on thin, knobby terrain with no pro in sight! Time to relax and watch my balance with my pack. I could see the easiest way through was to head straight up, and there were some cracks there for the first piece of pro, about 20-25\' off the belay. However, the cracks were choked with ice now, and the best edges for crimping and edging had eyebrows of ice on them.&amp;Acirc;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;\r\n&lt;div&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;/div&gt;\r\n&lt;div&gt;Uhh . . .&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"http://lh3.ggpht.com/-wQrb0qPshcw/UFGcxzBOyZI/AAAAAAABSzo/CgP8PwkiMn0/s2000/2012-09-04%252520-%25252017a%252520-%252520P5%252520icy%252520face%252520climbing%252520finish.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"http://lh3.ggpht.com/-wQrb0qPshcw/UFGcxzBOyZI/AAAAAAABSzo/CgP8PwkiMn0/s600/2012-09-04%252520-%25252017a%252520-%252520P5%252520icy%252520face%252520climbing%252520finish.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;P5 icy face climbing (our P6). Where I could, I was ripping chunks off to clear handholds and footholds. Overall I adjusted my route to avoid the ice, making me go far off route to the right.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\nI traversed even farther to the right where I could get in a piece, then climbed up. Eventually the terrain forced me back to the main iced up bottleneck, but at least I was closer to pro, and I could climb into it better from the side than below. All of the best holds had ice on them, so I started grabbing some of the eyebrows of ice and began ripping them off the rock wall. I could get enough off to make a slightly better path through the crux, and as the terrain eased up and more of the rock had ice on it, &amp;Acirc;&amp;nbsp;went all out, ripping ice clear from holds and tossing it behind me to make a path up the face. When I later told Steph about doing this, she said she was getting pelted with ice, but thought it was from pieces naturally detaching from the face as the rock heated up. My bad!&lt;/div&gt;\r\n&lt;div&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;/div&gt;\r\n&lt;div&gt;Finally I started making headway until I reached a long, leaning wide crack. Here the rock steepened became even icier. I was running low on small gear and the crack was too wide for anything else. So I detoured again, climbing along the crack far to the right, and around a corner to a sloping ledge. Since there as a fixed anchor in this slab, I thought it was the slab pitch atop the Classic variation (it later turned out to be the next corner over). I had renewed appreciation for the line we had been taking as I was back in the shade and wind again and it sucked! I belayed Steph in and by the time she arrived I was starting to shiver uncontrollably.&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"http://lh6.ggpht.com/-vXPHXi4snWg/UFGczJMIo2I/AAAAAAABSzs/m80wHk9xErE/s2000/2012-09-04%252520-%25252018%252520-%252520Icy%252520slab%252520pitch.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"http://lh6.ggpht.com/-vXPHXi4snWg/UFGczJMIo2I/AAAAAAABSzs/m80wHk9xErE/s600/2012-09-04%252520-%25252018%252520-%252520Icy%252520slab%252520pitch.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Belay at rapp anchor above an icy slab.

I could tell it would be a straightforwrad 5.6-5.7 chimney if I could face right-side in, but with a pack there was no way I was going to fit that way, so I climbed it facing straight it. I made decent progress with shoulder jams and standing up off of crossed legs, levered off the wall. There was a chockstone inside, but no other pro, and facing straight in I couldn\'t get in deep enough to reach the chockstone. Also, the chimney was lined in flaky, dead lichen.&amp;Acirc;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;\r\n&lt;div&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;/div&gt;\r\n&lt;div&gt;I made it halfway up the chimney when the puffy jacket I was wearing tore open, shrinking my shoulder jams enough that I fell back down, shearing off lichen as it ground up the jacket. I took off the puffy to reattempt the chimney in my sturdier and grippier soft shell jacket. I made it about halfway up again and had trouble getting enough leverage with my crossed legs and I slipped down again. So I went up a third time, all out, as falling inside the chimney was a safe, slow-motion oozing anyways.&lt;/div&gt;\r\n&lt;div&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;/div&gt;\r\n&lt;div&gt;This time I made to the top, but there was no pro in sight. Waiting for me was a sloping slab covered in ice, and it would be very awkward to climb onto it. If I slipped, I would fly off the ledge and take a real fall this time onto the ledge below. Due to the awkwardness of the exit, I decided trailing the pack would be a bad idea as well. Regrettably, I downclimbed and left my pack clipped to my last piece of pro, hoping that I could make a belay atop the next chimney and haul the pack up once Steph reached it.&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"http://lh6.ggpht.com/-n6_U8m7mxoQ/UFGdaUP_-TI/AAAAAAABS14/gOwkGqxCDqU/s2000/2012-09-04%252520-%25252046%252520-%252520P9%252520icy%252520chimney.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"http://lh6.ggpht.com/-n6_U8m7mxoQ/UFGdaUP_-TI/AAAAAAABS14/gOwkGqxCDqU/s600/2012-09-04%252520-%25252046%252520-%252520P9%252520icy%252520chimney.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Our P10 icy squeeze chimney, lined with lots of loose, sharp, dead lichen.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\nThis time, facing right side in, the chimney was pretty casual apart from the slippery lichen and ice.  Also, this time I could climb in deep enough to place a cam in the chockstone at the top to protect the exit.

However, our experience on the North Ridge showed us that the North Face was decidedly out of condition for the rest of our trip due to the amount of ice on the route. However, I had also posed to Steph the unusual idea of camping, for no practical reason, on the west slopes of Mt. Teewinot, in order to get some nice night and sunrise photographs from there. So despite our dropping the North Face from consideration, she was game for checking out the traverse and carrying camp out over the summit of Mt Teewinot.&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-yDmR-bKf5MM/UGGE8Om6FBI/AAAAAAABTv4/o1Kl_ue7zyk/s2000/Teton%2520Grand%2520Slam%2520-%2520GE%2520-%25207b.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-yDmR-bKf5MM/UGGE8Om6FBI/AAAAAAABTv4/o1Kl_ue7zyk/s600/Teton%2520Grand%2520Slam%2520-%2520GE%2520-%25207b.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Black Dike Traverse and our day\'s travels seen from above&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-HcOomiyTftE/UGGE-Fg9vhI/AAAAAAABTwA/wmkNfuHtsHU/s2000/Teton%2520Grand%2520Slam%2520-%2520GE%2520-%25207c.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-HcOomiyTftE/UGGE-Fg9vhI/AAAAAAABTwA/wmkNfuHtsHU/s600/Teton%2520Grand%2520Slam%2520-%2520GE%2520-%25207c.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Carryout Day 1&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\nWe had become fond of using stays to keep the wind from shaking our tent as much. Upon our return to the Lower Saddle camp the day before, I really got into it. Nerd alert!\r\n&lt;div&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"http://lh5.ggpht.com/-LCgpxA7IbSM/UFGdwJnf5mI/AAAAAAABS9g/QZUuF1MZOiY/s2000/2012-09-05%252520-%25252001%252520-%252520Tensegrity%252520Tent%252520System.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"http://lh5.ggpht.com/-LCgpxA7IbSM/UFGdwJnf5mI/AAAAAAABS9g/QZUuF1MZOiY/s600/2012-09-05%252520-%25252001%252520-%252520Tensegrity%252520Tent%252520System.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;An engineering problem! The aim is to provide a transverse restraint to the top of the tent to reduce wind-induced oscillation. However, the clients desired to keep the sun platform to the east clear of any structure. The solution was to create a tensegrity structure using a tension-only member (alpine sling), anchored to the rock with an SLCD, and a compression-only member, (telescoping hiking pole). Uplift from the wind would cause the hiking pole to fall off of the rock, so the restraints of the compression member were reinforced by post-tensioning the system by telescoping the pole in order to reduce uplift on the compression member. The tent is rigid enough against longitudinal oscillations that no external out-of-plane restraints were necessary.:-)&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"http://lh3.ggpht.com/-VwWcwWrQOO0/UFGd0JAB0gI/AAAAAAABS9o/yo5hn6UgJVc/s2000/2012-09-05%252520-%25252003%252520-%252520Tensegrity%252520Tent%252520System.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"http://lh3.ggpht.com/-VwWcwWrQOO0/UFGd0JAB0gI/AAAAAAABS9o/yo5hn6UgJVc/s600/2012-09-05%252520-%25252003%252520-%252520Tensegrity%252520Tent%252520System.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Connection detail of Tensegrity tent system to restrain it against the wind.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;hr&gt;\r\n&lt;hr&gt;\r\n&lt;h2&gt;\r\n&lt;a name=\"TOC-The-Black-Dike-Traverse-to-the-Teton-Glacier\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;The Black Dike Traverse to the Teton Glacier&lt;/h2&gt;\r\nThis traverse is the most convenient way to access the North East side of the Grand Teton from the Lower Saddle. As such, it is often used to return to camps near the Teton Glacier after climbing routes like the North Face or the East Ridge. It is also used to access a myriad of nice routes on the Grand itself, as well as some adjacent towers. The routefinding on this traverse is very straightforward, although it has a lot of loose rock. The traverse is probably a lot more enjoyable in earlier season when there is more snow on it - especially on the final long couloir.&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-rO9DFn7wJZM/UFRbSta6v4I/AAAAAAABUuI/In_yW1WVbqw/s2000/2012-08-30%2520-%252044%2520-%2520Grand%2520Teton%2520from%2520Bonneys%2520Pinnacle%2520-%2520annotated.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-rO9DFn7wJZM/UFRbSta6v4I/AAAAAAABUuI/In_yW1WVbqw/s600/2012-08-30%2520-%252044%2520-%2520Grand%2520Teton%2520from%2520Bonneys%2520Pinnacle%2520-%2520annotated.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Lower Saddle Area and the first part of the Black Dike Traverse&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"http://lh5.ggpht.com/-BoYnAgrcTe8/UFqGjDpCPMI/AAAAAAABTDI/ZwqEGzygnVs/s2000/2012-09-05%252520-%25252004%252520-%252520Steph%252520starting%252520the%252520Black%252520Dike%252520Traverse%252520-%252520annotated.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"http://lh5.ggpht.com/-BoYnAgrcTe8/UFqGjDpCPMI/AAAAAAABTDI/ZwqEGzygnVs/s600/2012-09-05%252520-%25252004%252520-%252520Steph%252520starting%252520the%252520Black%252520Dike%252520Traverse%252520-%252520annotated.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Starting the Black Dike Traverse.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"http://lh4.ggpht.com/-WF1OAvwElv8/UFGd3E_KLGI/AAAAAAABS9w/jUc-ZDMaUxI/s2000/2012-09-05%252520-%25252005%252520-%252520Black%252520Dike%252520Traverse.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"http://lh4.ggpht.com/-WF1OAvwElv8/UFGd3E_KLGI/AAAAAAABS9w/jUc-ZDMaUxI/s600/2012-09-05%252520-%25252005%252520-%252520Black%252520Dike%252520Traverse.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Ascending to Glencoe Col.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"http://lh5.ggpht.com/-EQiygWKJ4MA/UFGd4nSVUpI/AAAAAAABS90/lmAJuNwV_zA/s2000/2012-09-05%252520-%25252006%252520-%252520Optional%252520lower%252520pitches%252520to%252520the%252520Exum%252520Ridge.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"http://lh5.ggpht.com/-EQiygWKJ4MA/UFGd4nSVUpI/AAAAAAABS90/lmAJuNwV_zA/s600/2012-09-05%252520-%25252006%252520-%252520Optional%252520lower%252520pitches%252520to%252520the%252520Exum%252520Ridge.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Optional lower pitches to the Lower Exum Ridge.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"http://lh5.ggpht.com/-5ZO49sbA9Ao/UFGd7d76uWI/AAAAAAABS98/OdmA5BTqho0/s2000/2012-09-05%252520-%25252008%252520-%252520Base%252520of%252520Petzold%252520Ridge.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"http://lh5.ggpht.com/-5ZO49sbA9Ao/UFGd7d76uWI/AAAAAAABS98/OdmA5BTqho0/s600/2012-09-05%252520-%25252008%252520-%252520Base%252520of%252520Petzold%252520Ridge.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Base of Petzoldt Ridge.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"http://lh5.ggpht.com/--m9hodM_6mA/UFGd8vOJ-2I/AAAAAAABS-E/KM1XCmwG-s4/s2000/2012-09-05%252520-%25252009%252520-%252520First%252520Notch%252520in%252520Black%252520DikeTraverse.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"http://lh5.ggpht.com/--m9hodM_6mA/UFGd8vOJ-2I/AAAAAAABS-E/KM1XCmwG-s4/s600/2012-09-05%252520-%25252009%252520-%252520First%252520Notch%252520in%252520Black%252520DikeTraverse.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Looking up Underhill Ridge.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"http://lh3.ggpht.com/-i4KTq5Jrxjs/UFlYSLARjDI/AAAAAAABS-I/kK0s3MRwFXI/s2000/2012-09-05%252520-%25252009a%252520-%252520Descending%252520from%252520first%252520notch%252520-%252520Steph.JPG\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"http://lh3.ggpht.com/-i4KTq5Jrxjs/UFlYSLARjDI/AAAAAAABS-I/kK0s3MRwFXI/s600/2012-09-05%252520-%25252009a%252520-%252520Descending%252520from%252520first%252520notch%252520-%252520Steph.JPG\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Crossing through Glencoe Col, heading towards Teepe Col.

We had an awkward time on the Teepe Glacier, as the recent hail had created a thin layer of slush on top of the ice. I had just barely shed my layers down to shorts and a t-shirt and was attempting to crampon down the glacier in my approach shoes when I took a fall. That slush kept the crampon points from engaging in the ice while creating a nice slippery cushion. So despite the warm sunny weather (for once!) I still managed to get cold and wet today after sliding some 30 ft on the snow before I could self arrest. Steph saw my faux pas and followed much more carefully.&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"http://lh5.ggpht.com/-yRWCnmLkzwU/UFqGpvuIDwI/AAAAAAABTDQ/StXCsyrCM7A/s2000/2012-09-05%252520-%25252022%252520-%252520Teepee%252520Glacier%252520-%252520annotated.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"http://lh5.ggpht.com/-yRWCnmLkzwU/UFqGpvuIDwI/AAAAAAABTDQ/StXCsyrCM7A/s600/2012-09-05%252520-%25252022%252520-%252520Teepee%252520Glacier%252520-%252520annotated.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Black Dike traverse from Teepe Col to Dike Col.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"http://lh3.ggpht.com/-A5OzjB46Uj4/UFqGs-D1bVI/AAAAAAABTDU/V-b0MJJvcLA/s2000/2012-09-05%252520-%25252025%252520-%252520Teepee%252520Pillar%252520%252526%252520Glacier%252520-%252520annotated.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"http://lh3.ggpht.com/-A5OzjB46Uj4/UFqGs-D1bVI/AAAAAAABTDU/V-b0MJJvcLA/s600/2012-09-05%252520-%25252025%252520-%252520Teepee%252520Pillar%252520%252526%252520Glacier%252520-%252520annotated.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Black Dike traverse from Teepe Col to Dike Col.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"http://lh5.ggpht.com/-rnkdxLDLIG0/UFGeL3mUUTI/AAAAAAABS_E/lVBjONbdQVo/s2000/2012-09-05%252520-%25252023%252520-%252520Teepee%252520Glacier%252520%252526%252520Nez%252520Perce.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"http://lh5.ggpht.com/-rnkdxLDLIG0/UFGeL3mUUTI/AAAAAAABS_E/lVBjONbdQVo/s600/2012-09-05%252520-%25252023%252520-%252520Teepee%252520Glacier%252520%252526%252520Nez%252520Perce.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Teepe Glacier &amp;amp; Nez Perce.

As we rounded the corner our path got much steeper. Rather than moving slowly through steep rock with our heavy packs on, we took them off to do a recon higher up. Scrambling up we hit a knife edge ridge and got cliffed out. Oops! At least by looking back I could see better were we had wandered and where we should probably go. We gathered our packs and with only about 30 min time wasted, were back on route.&amp;Acirc;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;\r\n&lt;div&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;/div&gt;\r\n&lt;div&gt;Apparently the guidebook should have said \"as soon as you reach the large grassy ledge, turn left immediately, and head up the nearest large chute\". This would have been a much better way to describe the best route. We were able to traverse high into the chute, which appeared to be blocked by a huge chockstone. There was an opening to the right that offered pretty reasonable class 3-4 scrambling, and a short ways higher I saw a good way to traverse out left and onto the western plateau.&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"http://lh6.ggpht.com/-hDOtF-dqP-c/UFGe9CEI-eI/AAAAAAABTBk/Rg01aVtilTg/s2000/2012-09-05%252520-%25252056%252520-%252520Course%252520correction.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"http://lh6.ggpht.com/-hDOtF-dqP-c/UFGe9CEI-eI/AAAAAAABTBk/Rg01aVtilTg/s600/2012-09-05%252520-%25252056%252520-%252520Course%252520correction.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Course correction.

Steph&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;s parents had climbed it 30 years ago, and she wanted to climb the route as a bit of a homage to her parents. She had brought along some photographs from the climb in hopes of recreating some of the photographs with her climbing in them. She had even acquired her mother&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;s pants, pack, and ice axe that were used in the 1982 climb to bring as props!\r\n&lt;div&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;/div&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-swi0LC_jbKA/UGGEoD-KB5I/AAAAAAABTug/NgigayZ-HbE/s2000/Teton%2520Grand%2520Slam%2520-%2520GE%2520-%25209.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-swi0LC_jbKA/UGGEoD-KB5I/AAAAAAABTug/NgigayZ-HbE/s600/Teton%2520Grand%2520Slam%2520-%2520GE%2520-%25209.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;div&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\nWe met up at the trailhead parking on the north side of Jackson Lake just before sunrise. After a quick breakfast and brew of coffee as we packed, we hit the trail. It had rained hard the night before, but most of the trail was dry by this time. The sky was still full of clouds, but as we left the lake trail and ascended, we popped above them and got our first view of Symmetry Spire.&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"http://lh5.ggpht.com/-xcAk2sPXKeg/UFGg-nSluHI/AAAAAAABTDo/FotkyO8S2QI/s2000/2012-09-07%252520-%25252001%252520-%252520Symmetry%252520Spire%252520on%252520Approach.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"http://lh5.ggpht.com/-xcAk2sPXKeg/UFGg-nSluHI/AAAAAAABTDo/FotkyO8S2QI/s600/2012-09-07%252520-%25252001%252520-%252520Symmetry%252520Spire%252520on%252520Approach.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Approaching Symmetry Spire.

It isn\'t obvious to the casual hiker, but if you know to look for it, the trail is fairly well trodden, which was good for us because the brush lower down would have been very unpleasant to bushwack through. Since it had rained a lot, the brush was still soaked in water, so despite the clear weather forecast, we still got wet today!&amp;Acirc;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"http://lh6.ggpht.com/-dsS65iUk7yE/UFGhA-eNM8I/AAAAAAABTDs/j3-rB9qzWQU/s2000/2012-09-07%252520-%25252002%252520-%252520Steph%252520doing%252520some%252520schwacking.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"http://lh6.ggpht.com/-dsS65iUk7yE/UFGhA-eNM8I/AAAAAAABTDs/j3-rB9qzWQU/s600/2012-09-07%252520-%25252002%252520-%252520Steph%252520doing%252520some%252520schwacking.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Steph doing some schwacking.

We could hear shouting from some other climbers who had started up even earlier. They were climbing the Durrance Ridge, so we had the Southwest Ridge all to ourselves.&amp;Acirc;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;\r\n&lt;div&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;/div&gt;\r\n&lt;div&gt;However, there was some uncertainty on exactly where to start the first pitch. We could see a higher ledge and lower ledge with trees on them and both options seemed to match the topo. In keeping with our tradition of starting the day off route, we took the wrong start.&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"http://lh3.ggpht.com/-pRjwVAo1TDo/UFGhLUmg1xI/AAAAAAABTEU/ngeS_3zIxRU/s2000/2012-09-07%252520-%25252011%252520-%252520Symmetry%252520Spire.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"http://lh3.ggpht.com/-pRjwVAo1TDo/UFGhLUmg1xI/AAAAAAABTEU/ngeS_3zIxRU/s600/2012-09-07%252520-%25252011%252520-%252520Symmetry%252520Spire.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Symmetry Spire seen on the approach.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"http://lh3.ggpht.com/-VtL9Nz-v0j0/UFGhOwvaBQI/AAAAAAABTEg/S6rUgbfVz-w/s2000/2012-09-07%252520-%25252013a%252520-%252520View%252520South%252520from%252520Symmetry%252520Spire%252520Start.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"http://lh3.ggpht.com/-VtL9Nz-v0j0/UFGhOwvaBQI/AAAAAAABTEg/S6rUgbfVz-w/s600/2012-09-07%252520-%25252013a%252520-%252520View%252520South%252520from%252520Symmetry%252520Spire%252520Start.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Looking south from the base of the SW Ridge of Symmetry Spire.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\nI hadn&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;t realized it until Steph told me at the base of the climb, but this climb had some other potential significance as well. During our Teton climbing, I had led every pitch that was 5.6 and harder. Despite being a stronger climber than me, and far more comfortable soloing, Steph had not quite felt up to any of the 5th class leads, as she has been struggling in regaining her lead head since her climbing accident in 2010 on Vesper Peak, from which her leg is still recovering. Although I offered my support in leading any of the pitches, we agreed that since she missed on out the leading thus far, she should have dibs on leading every pitch on Symmetry Spire. I had thought that Steph had done some trad leading this summer, but as it turned out she hadn\'t led anything harder than 4th to low 5th class - &amp;Acirc;&amp;nbsp;Symmetry Spire would be the first climb where she truly attempted to get back into leading trad!&lt;/div&gt;\r\n&lt;div&gt;&amp;Acirc;&amp;nbsp;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"http://lh3.ggpht.com/-X4ZeHhgTQIA/UFGhSL2NzkI/AAAAAAABTEo/cEpjhF3sDoQ/s2000/2012-09-07%252520-%25252015%252520-%252520Steph%252520lacing%252520up%252520to%252520start.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"http://lh3.ggpht.com/-X4ZeHhgTQIA/UFGhSL2NzkI/AAAAAAABTEo/cEpjhF3sDoQ/s600/2012-09-07%252520-%25252015%252520-%252520Steph%252520lacing%252520up%252520to%252520start.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Steph lacing up to start.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\nHowever, things went off to a bumpy start. Steph climbed partway up and was really not feeling confident. The start was supposed to be 5.6, and it felt much too hard. From my vantage it didn\'t look that bad, and I tried offering some suggestions to Steph on what looked like some good ways to go. She still thought it was too much, and backed off, discouraged. I turned things around, though as when I climbed up to where she had backed off, I found the climbing surprisingly thin, steep, and dirty. No way was this 5.6! I backed off too and we decided to check out the other ledge that was not at the low point of the ridge, but closer to the crest.&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"http://lh3.ggpht.com/--ueblmXWFO0/UFGhTxkenII/AAAAAAABTEs/PETETtedipk/s2000/2012-09-07%252520-%25252016%252520-%252520Steph%252520starting%252520up%252520the%252520wrong%252520way.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"http://lh3.ggpht.com/--ueblmXWFO0/UFGhTxkenII/AAAAAAABTEs/PETETtedipk/s600/2012-09-07%252520-%25252016%252520-%252520Steph%252520starting%252520up%252520the%252520wrong%252520way.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Steph starting up the wrong way.

After knocking off the classics, we wanted a bit more \'adventure\', and figured Warbonnet would be a good casual \'alpine\' outing. The descriptions made it sound semi-serious with tricky routefinding, but given how fast and easily we knocked off the &lt;a href=\"http://www.markpthomas.com/mountaineering/trip-reports/wyoming/pingora-ne-face\"&gt;NE Face of Pingora&lt;/a&gt; the day before, we figured we could make short work of this climb and hike out the same day to try some climbs in the Tetons.&amp;Acirc;&amp;nbsp;&lt;div&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, the published guidebook description and line didn\'t match Radek\'s account of the climb, which led us off route. Then once we located ourselves, the exit pitch was indicated very differently between the two sources. We should have believed Radek over the guidebook! Also, the route itself was quite humbling as it was far more unnverving than expected. Ultimately we prevailed and completed a seldom-done climb that is gritty, grassy, stout, and often runout, but takes a great line up a gorgeous peak. We found this climb to be MUCH harder and it took us MUCH longer than the IV, 5.8 NE Face of Pingora that we climed 2 days prior. Don\'t do this one unless you lead much harder than 5.8!\r\n\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;h2&gt;\r\n&lt;a name=\"TOC-Confusion\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Confusion&lt;/h2&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;So given a choice between a published guide that you paid money for and assumed has been vetted, versus the casual recollections of a climber that he wrote down and drew up during spare time at work and distributed for free online, which one would you take? Upon casual glance, the routes appeared to be the same, but as we climbed up the face, their descriptions began to differ from each other and what we encountered. We erred on following Bechtel\'s guidebook, but in the end we were sorry that we had doubted Radek!\r\n&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;&lt;table border=\"0\"&gt;\r\n&lt;tbody&gt;\r\n&lt;tr&gt;\r\n&lt;td width=\"50%\"&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-WKC9U9j-h8M/UTWuVHk1ccI/AAAAAAABtkI/IF7ol4tFdkY/s2000/2012-08-24%2520-%252001%2520-%2520War%2520Bonnett%2520from%2520Jackass%2520Pass%2520-%2520annotated%2520Guides.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-WKC9U9j-h8M/UTWuVHk1ccI/AAAAAAABtkI/IF7ol4tFdkY/s400/2012-08-24%2520-%252001%2520-%2520War%2520Bonnett%2520from%2520Jackass%2520Pass%2520-%2520annotated%2520Guides.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;/td&gt;\r\n&lt;td&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-FJ9qlmCMCR8/UTWuWf9BVgI/AAAAAAABtkQ/cuYiqVpW4co/s2000/2012-08-24%2520-%252001%2520-%2520War%2520Bonnett%2520from%2520Jackass%2520Pass%2520-%2520annotated%2520Ours.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-FJ9qlmCMCR8/UTWuWf9BVgI/AAAAAAABtkQ/cuYiqVpW4co/s400/2012-08-24%2520-%252001%2520-%2520War%2520Bonnett%2520from%2520Jackass%2520Pass%2520-%2520annotated%2520Ours.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\r\n&lt;/tr&gt;\r\n&lt;/tbody&gt;\r\n&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;War Bonnet\'s NE Face seen from near Jackass Pass, and route lines laid down in retrospect . . .&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;h2&gt;\r\n&lt;a name=\"TOC-Approach\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Approach&lt;/h2&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-9imZL0WLyAE/UFInB4H4h3I/AAAAAAABPQ0/3-A4OOPpm6g/s1600/2012-08-23%252520-%25252003%252520-%252520Watch%252520Tower%252520%252526%252520Others%252520under%252520alpenglow.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-9imZL0WLyAE/UFInB4H4h3I/AAAAAAABPQ0/3-A4OOPpm6g/s800/2012-08-23%252520-%25252003%252520-%252520Watch%252520Tower%252520%252526%252520Others%252520under%252520alpenglow.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Watch Tower and others under morning alpenglow.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;&lt;table border=\"0\"&gt;\r\n&lt;tbody&gt;\r\n&lt;tr&gt;\r\n&lt;td width=\"50%\"&gt;&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-hXx-Pw0BuxQ/UFInAKmQHeI/AAAAAAABPQs/6m-PFkTGSlY/s1600/2012-08-23%252520-%25252001%252520-%252520War%252520Bonnett%252520in%252520the%252520morning.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-hXx-Pw0BuxQ/UFInAKmQHeI/AAAAAAABPQs/6m-PFkTGSlY/s400/2012-08-23%252520-%25252001%252520-%252520War%252520Bonnett%252520in%252520the%252520morning.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;War Bonnet under alpenglow.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\r\n&lt;td&gt;&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-9BN39T2qpRI/UFInAtFapVI/AAAAAAABPQw/76jZPocflgw/s1600/2012-08-23%252520-%25252002%252520-%252520War%252520Bonnett%252520upper%252520NE%252520Face.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-9BN39T2qpRI/UFInAtFapVI/AAAAAAABPQw/76jZPocflgw/s400/2012-08-23%252520-%25252002%252520-%252520War%252520Bonnett%252520upper%252520NE%252520Face.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;NE Face of War Bonnet.

So we hiked over the climber\'s version of Jackass Pass, descended a hundred feet or so before picking our way over on a ledge system. Now, we had in mind that the switchback would be smaller than it was, and that the cl. 4 might be old school, so we were ready for some harder soloing. So when the ledge seemed to choke off, we started up a broken ledge system above us.&amp;Acirc;&amp;nbsp;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\nDon\'t do that.&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\nI ended up in iffy 5th class terrain, and the ledges above looked less reasonable as I got higher, so we had to work out a retreat option. It just so happened that we saw a few rappel slings in the area as we backed down and added ours to the cliffside . . .\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\nWe headed up the chute where the ledge appeared to end and popped out the backside on a much longer ledge system. In the end, we nearly ended up on the south side of the peak before we reached the ledge that traversed back up to the Plume, but it is casual, scenic, and probably goes much faster if you know where you\'re going.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;&lt;table border=\"0\"&gt;\r\n&lt;tbody&gt;\r\n&lt;tr&gt;\r\n&lt;td width=\"50%\"&gt;&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-e35ah83Gl6o/UFInEn6stPI/AAAAAAABPRA/YWIpcvMsypE/s1600/2012-08-23%252520-%25252005%252520-%252520Approach%252520Ledges%252520above%252520Arrowhead%252520Lake.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-e35ah83Gl6o/UFInEn6stPI/AAAAAAABPRA/YWIpcvMsypE/s400/2012-08-23%252520-%25252005%252520-%252520Approach%252520Ledges%252520above%252520Arrowhead%252520Lake.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Approach ledges above Arrowhead Lake. You can mostly traverse over to this from the \'climber\'s Jackass Pass\' trail. Look carefully for a line and some cairns as you encounter the large boulders as you descend from the pass.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\r\n&lt;td&gt;&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-INo5UzIOl8o/UFInF0t06wI/AAAAAAABPRE/epAWH1XtFNU/s1600/2012-08-23%252520-%25252006%252520-%252520Thomas%252520on%252520the%252520long%252520approach%252520ledge.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-INo5UzIOl8o/UFInF0t06wI/AAAAAAABPRE/epAWH1XtFNU/s400/2012-08-23%252520-%25252006%252520-%252520Thomas%252520on%252520the%252520long%252520approach%252520ledge.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Looking back at Thomas following the traverse approach. Traverse much longer than you think. The ledge appears to end, but actually narrows, drops down, then widens and continues. The switchback is obvious and if you are climbing harder than cl. 2 to exit the ledge, you are leaving it too early.

However, as the face loomed larger, points of reference disappeared and the way to go became less clear. Both Radek and Bechtel described a chimney after the first pitch. We saw 3 to choose from. The middle one seemed more chimney-like than the right one, but more in line with where we were going, so we climbed up that, expecting to traverse back right as per Radek\'s topo.\r\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;&lt;table border=\"0\"&gt;\r\n&lt;tbody&gt;\r\n&lt;tr&gt;\r\n&lt;td width=\"50%\"&gt;&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-Ny8d4iMJgXA/UFInZqR7DLI/AAAAAAABPR8/yOAEdWijIf4/s1600/2012-08-23%252520-%25252020%252520-%252520Thomas%252520Leading%252520P2.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-Ny8d4iMJgXA/UFInZqR7DLI/AAAAAAABPR8/yOAEdWijIf4/s400/2012-08-23%252520-%25252020%252520-%252520Thomas%252520Leading%252520P2.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Thomas leading the 5.6 chimney on P2.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\r\n&lt;td&gt;&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-K5tROoJhH1g/UFIna6vas0I/AAAAAAABPSA/Y8Ktt2_OWyU/s1600/2012-08-23%252520-%25252021%252520-%252520Following%252520P2%252520Chimney.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-K5tROoJhH1g/UFIna6vas0I/AAAAAAABPSA/Y8Ktt2_OWyU/s400/2012-08-23%252520-%25252021%252520-%252520Following%252520P2%252520Chimney.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;P2 5.6 chimney.

The prospect of an unexpected fall was much higher here, but with much less security with pro and safe fall zones.

We looked more closely at both guides and saw that they were pointing at distinctly different exits. Also, we couldn\'t see the terrain around us well enough to pinpoint just where we were on the face. We thought we were still on route (whatever that was at this point), but we weren\'t too confident about that. I started up P5, which was supposed to be 5.6 and presumably a break from the scarier climbing down low. I guess it was 5.6, but something about the rock and strange body positions made it all feel spooky.\r\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;&lt;table border=\"0\"&gt;\r\n&lt;tbody&gt;\r\n&lt;tr&gt;\r\n&lt;td width=\"50%\"&gt;&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-Ge5KaUz04fQ/UFInvqWPiTI/AAAAAAABPS8/im9EKZH4EWY/s1600/2012-08-23%252520-%25252036%252520-%252520P5.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-Ge5KaUz04fQ/UFInvqWPiTI/AAAAAAABPS8/im9EKZH4EWY/s400/2012-08-23%252520-%25252036%252520-%252520P5.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;P5 (5.6 spooky).&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\r\n&lt;td&gt;&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-Xv6TUtsl3vA/UFInySjSFmI/AAAAAAABPTA/ZzYkR9XUfWE/s1600/2012-08-23%252520-%25252037%252520-%252520P5.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-Xv6TUtsl3vA/UFInySjSFmI/AAAAAAABPTA/ZzYkR9XUfWE/s400/2012-08-23%252520-%25252037%252520-%252520P5.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;P5 (5.6 spooky)&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\r\n&lt;/tr&gt;\r\n&lt;/tbody&gt;\r\n&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\nI gained ground fast and saw a chimney blocking the end quickly approaching. Then I came across rappel slings. I thought that would be odd to find if we were on route, and the chimney above looked large, so I wondered if it was much tougher than 5.6 and was in fact the wrong exit. I continued up a bit higher above the slings on a really tough finger crack (felt like 5.8+, but too awkward to protect, so I ran it out above the rappel horn), then had more doubts. I figured it would be easier to reverse here than going higher, so I downclimbed with a nut left as a TR piece, then rigged a rappel off the slings. Perhaps we weren\'t far enough over on the face?&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-ET4tPt3fhTA/UFIn09bfrxI/AAAAAAABPTE/A4kkmCybMcA/s1600/2012-08-23%252520-%25252038%252520-%252520P5%252520looking%252520down.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-ET4tPt3fhTA/UFIn09bfrxI/AAAAAAABPTE/A4kkmCybMcA/s600/2012-08-23%252520-%25252038%252520-%252520P5%252520looking%252520down.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Looking down P5. I later bailed on this pitch after a 5.8 finger traverse above some fresh rapp slings. I had doubts about being on route, which was too bad, since this was the way we should have gone!&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;h2&gt;\r\n&lt;a name=\"TOC-Attempt-2\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Attempt 2&lt;/h2&gt;\r\nThe belay for P4 also had rappel slings, and looking down the corner to our right, we saw numerous rappel stations scattered over the face. So we rappelled down into the next corner and set up a belay to climb up, assuming that we were in the 5.6 corner system that Bechtel had indicated as the finish.\r\n\r\n\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\nThomas stopped before going very far, and said that the corner we were in seemed to end. No way was it 5.6 if he went higher. I climbed up to him and figured maybe we were still on the left side of the face and that corner ahead was a buttress blocking our view of the rest of the face. So Thomas belayed me as I traversed sideways to the corner in hopes of better seeing where we were, or maybe finding the corner of salvation around the bend.\r\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\nThe end of the traverse was interesting as I had &amp;Acirc;&amp;nbsp;to mantle atop a car-sized detached flake that vibrated under me. I felt it safe to assume it had not been adequately tested by prior climbers, so I tried to avoid pushing out too hard on it.\r\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;table border=\"0\"&gt;\r\n&lt;tbody&gt;\r\n&lt;tr&gt;\r\n&lt;td width=\"50%\"&gt;&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-axHB0AxWQAU/UFIn2y9oD_I/AAAAAAABPTI/DUtD7bdtffI/s1600/2012-08-23%252520-%25252039%252520-%252520Rapp%252520%252526%252520re-lead%252520to%252520traverse.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-axHB0AxWQAU/UFIn2y9oD_I/AAAAAAABPTI/DUtD7bdtffI/s400/2012-08-23%252520-%25252039%252520-%252520Rapp%252520%252526%252520re-lead%252520to%252520traverse.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;So we rappelled on some bail slings at the base of P5 (there were bail slings everywhere on the face) to a ledge near some other bail slings in the next chute over.

I thought the buttress on the skyline was midway across the face, and the chutes we sought after were maybe just around that corner (as there was nothing feasible in sight above us).

The tower in front seemed to overhang towards me. I think this is the Feather Pitch (5.9R/X).

Thomas is at the base and the \"Selects\" guide annotated photo indicated we exit to the near side of the flake in sunshine on the ridge.

Near the end of our stay a nighttime rain &amp;amp; lightning storm cleared out the smoke, so we enjoyed a scenic drive and then climbed Irene\'s Arete car-to-car, leaving at a casual 11am and getting back shortly after dark. It was a stellar climb, with surprisingly hard climbing for the grade! The views were incredible and the climbing was varied, sustained, and interesting.

The smoke also left us somewhat nauseous and with snotty hacking that increased each day.

Really not the best time to be heading up to do a climb in the Tetons, but the forecast for the day was all right, and we decided we\'d watch the weather carefully and decide as we go whether to hop on the climb. At the very least we would get in a good hike. (Note: We also thought about continuing up so late in the day on each pitch of the climb. However, at each of the belays we could see that it would be reasonable to quickly rappel down to shelter if the weather deteriorated, and the clouds stayed at bay, so we kept climbing. This route is not very committing.)&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Probably one of the highlights of the day was a rather bizarre encounter on the trail. A drop dead gorgeous gal in her late 20s was hiking up the trail, wearing nothing but very bright, sleek, skimpy workout clothes. She was fit enough that as we caught up we could tell she was hiking much slower than she could, and the light clothes really weren\'t necessary for how hard she was working to hike at that pace. However, she was holding hands love-dovey with a guy maybe 5-10 yrs older, dressed in trashy jeans and a dirty sweatshirt, looking like he belonged on the couch at home with a bag of chips more than on the trail, as he was panting with exhaustion. As we raced by she complimented us on our solid hiking form (Whaat? First time I\'ve ever heard someone say that as I passed), the guy said something in passing along the lines of us being crazy fast (which we weren\'t) and Thomas heard her telling her companion that actually she often hiked as fast with her girlfriends. Thomas and I were amused and confused at the bizarre contrast of the couple. What was going on there?&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;As we neared the Meadows, we realized that even with the beta from MountainProject, Teton Rock Climbs, and A Climber\'s Guide to the Tetons, we still could not identify the arete. The descriptions were somewhat vague, and the aerial photos we had were very difficult to match with the steep perspective of the south wall of Disappointment Pk. We couldn\'t even place ourselves in the photo.&amp;Acirc;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"http://lh3.ggpht.com/-ZPwj_XQuGJo/UFGWmDaJBkI/AAAAAAABUJw/d6EysST1DpE/s2000/2012-08-30%252520-%25252002%252520-%252520Irene%252527s%252520Arete.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"http://lh3.ggpht.com/-ZPwj_XQuGJo/UFGWmDaJBkI/AAAAAAABUJw/d6EysST1DpE/s600/2012-08-30%252520-%25252002%252520-%252520Irene%252527s%252520Arete.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Irene\'s Arete, unknown to us at the time.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"http://lh4.ggpht.com/-MqpIsWg17jU/UFGWrI4yi-I/AAAAAAABUKA/BBtCgpx3KgU/s2000/2012-08-30%252520-%25252004a%252520-%252520Irene%252527s%252520Arete.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"http://lh4.ggpht.com/-MqpIsWg17jU/UFGWrI4yi-I/AAAAAAABUKA/BBtCgpx3KgU/s600/2012-08-30%252520-%25252004a%252520-%252520Irene%252527s%252520Arete.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;We suspected this was Irene\'s Arete but still were not quite sure.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-dl5MWXVZwUQ/UIEScNPf7lI/AAAAAAABb9I/htkzdVDaRmg/s2000/2012-08-27%2520-%252021%2520-%2520Irene%2527s%2520Arete%2520from%2520the%2520Meadows%2520-%2520annotated.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-dl5MWXVZwUQ/UIEScNPf7lI/AAAAAAABb9I/htkzdVDaRmg/s600/2012-08-27%2520-%252021%2520-%2520Irene%2527s%2520Arete%2520from%2520the%2520Meadows%2520-%2520annotated.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Irene\'s Arete from the Meadows.

My body didn\'t want to climb anymore. Thomas felt similarly awful. Considering we had been near this altitude and in the dry air in the Cirque of the Towers for a week with no problems, I wonder if it was from 3 days of inhaling wildfire smoke? We felt less ambitious for the harder variations, but continued up the climb (we came this far). So Thomas took the 5.7 direct start instead of the 5.8 to the left (seemed contrived and didn\'t look to interesting) nor the 5.9 variation on the right (even more contrived, and looked gritty and unpleasant).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"http://lh6.ggpht.com/-iTPX4_Z-4nA/UFBC2eCIv0I/AAAAAAABalM/6An2H_9dOog/s2000/2012-08-27%252520-%25252027%252520-%252520Irene%252527s%252520Arete%252520-%252520Thomas%252520Leading%252520P2.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"http://lh6.ggpht.com/-iTPX4_Z-4nA/UFBC2eCIv0I/AAAAAAABalM/6An2H_9dOog/s600/2012-08-27%252520-%25252027%252520-%252520Irene%252527s%252520Arete%252520-%252520Thomas%252520Leading%252520P2.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Thomas leading P2, at the 5.7 face section.

Thomas\' morale had improved, so he raced up this fun corner. Alternatively, one could go left here onto an exposed slab and up a 5.7 corner, but I\'m sure this is much better.

This is definitely the best way to go as it stays most in line with the ridge, protects well, and is really fun!\r\n\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;I was intimidated by the exposure, though. You have to step across a wide gap into a stance at an undercling, and then undercling and lieback out left on a very steep wall, with several hundred feet of air beneath you. I don\'t really like exposure. I stepped over a few times, backed off, looked down at the tempting 5.8 finish that looked so friendly, but not nearly so inspiring. So I talked myself into the direct finish by saying I would \'check it out\', and if I could see a reasonable gear placement close by, I would climb up to it and inch forward a few more moves. I did this a few times, sewing things up, and by the time I decided I would go for it, I was already halfway through the crux! Just take care not to use up the blind #3 Camalot placement with a hand jam. Swapping your fist for the cam once you step over is tricky.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;\r\n&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"http://lh6.ggpht.com/-seEXaVew35Q/UFBDO_rKylI/AAAAAAABakI/iu6vfV2t8nU/s2000/2012-08-27%252520-%25252047%252520-%252520Irene%252527s%252520Arete%252520-%252520P5%2525205_9%252520plus%252520undercling.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"http://lh6.ggpht.com/-seEXaVew35Q/UFBDO_rKylI/AAAAAAABakI/iu6vfV2t8nU/s600/2012-08-27%252520-%25252047%252520-%252520Irene%252527s%252520Arete%252520-%252520P5%2525205_9%252520plus%252520undercling.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;P5 5.9+ undercling-lieback variation. It is pretty steep and much more exposed than it appears in this picture. You step left over a 500 ft drop to start.

Joe Bullough and I had come on a tight itinerary to climb the Grand Teton via the Exum ridge car-to-car. This decision was made mostly for practical purposes (Joe had to take advantage of the bi-annual landscaping waste service that would be in his neighborhood Sunday), but also in the spirit of our recent habits of making &lt;i&gt;EVERYTHING&lt;/i&gt; a &amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#152;day hike&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;. We had hoped to get here earlier for a few hours of sleep, but unfortunately we had some problems leaving as early as we had hoped, so we were doing this climb with a sleep handicap.  \r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;  We quickly packed up our gear amidst the other climbers sleeping in their vehicles and stole away into the night. It was very still and cooler than expected, and we made a good pace up the trail. Joe was very worried about running into a bear in the dark, and every few minutes he&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;d call out, just in case. I joined in the fun by making loud &amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#156;beeeeooowhooop!&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#157; calls, hoping this JarJar Binx call would help scare any bears away. This constant lookout for bears made things a little more tense, especially when we thought we saw eyes ahead of us on the trail (turned out to be city lights, duh!).  &lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;  Soon we reached the dreaded mega-switchbacks that lead up to Surprise and Amphitheater lakes. I&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;d been up these two times too many (i.e. twice), but luckily I counted the switchbacks on the topo before reaching them, so I could count them down until we reached the Garnet Canyon trail junction.  The 5 switchbacks passed by shortly and soon I was in new country, heading up Garnet Canyon.   &lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;  Suddenly Joe stopped and pointed up the hill. Two glowing eyes peered down at us, and blinked. We were still concerned about bears, but we couldn&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;t see what it was. It wouldn&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;t respond to our calls, so we slowly walked by beneath the orbs. At one point I thought I saw tall ears above the eyes, so perhaps it was a deer?  &lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;  Everything went smoothly until we got ourselves lost on the approach for the first time. This happened when we reached the beginning of \'Boulder Central\' along the trail.  No trail seemed to appear down by the river, and I thought the trail went higher up the side of the canyon at that point, so we wasted time climbing the hillside to the base of some cliffs. After descending we quickly found the trail again and soon we reached the Meadows Camping area. Some climbers were just starting to stir, so we picked up the pace &amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#147; we wanted to be the first ones on the mountain!   &lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;  After passing a log bridge, the trail began heading up and right. For some reason Joe thought that this was the Middle Teton trail and that we had missed the turnoff, so he charged cross country off the trail and up the hill. I was regretting doing the approach in my stiff mountaineering boots at this time, and my blisters weren&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;t happy with the detour. I finally convinced him that we left the correct trail, so we scrambled up and left to intersect the switchbacks that headed over 1,000 feet up the moraine headwall for the Middle Teton Glacier. Below us the headlamps from other climbers bobbed, but soon they were out of site as we charged up the hill.  &lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;  Soon the hill relented a bit as we began hiking through the moraine, stumbling across yet more hikers just waking up. From here we could see that climbers at the lower saddle were breaking camp &amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#147; we&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;d better hurry. Soon we reached the snowfield, whipped out our ice axes, and charged across the snowy headwall, and then straight up to reach the saddle.  &lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;  Sadly, the climbers at the lower saddle had beaten us up the mountain, as two groups were already beginning to pass the black dike. Joe and I stowed some water and our ice axes behind a boulder near the Exum guide shelters and continued hiking. By this time, we were both getting pretty tired and our pace was slowing down quickly &amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#147; some climbers from the Upper Moraine campsite were catching up!    \r\n\r\n&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;h2&gt;\r\n&lt;a name=\"TOC-Exum-Ridge---5:30-am\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Exum Ridge - 5:30 am&lt;/h2&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;\r\n&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-x2u__cQkHuE/TjFYlUTxifI/AAAAAAAAkCM/-rIsYAsCM4k/s2000/7-16-05-02-GrandTeton%2520from%2520LowerSaddle.jpg\" style=\"text-align:-webkit-center\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"\" border=\"2\" src=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-x2u__cQkHuE/TjFYlUTxifI/AAAAAAAAkCM/-rIsYAsCM4k/s800/7-16-05-02-GrandTeton%2520from%2520LowerSaddle.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Grand Teton seen from the Lower Saddle on the approach&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;We followed the climber&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;s trail as it passed the black dike, and soon we were scrambling in class 3 terrain.

From here we stayed near the rocky crest as we scrambled through class 3-4 terrain until we could find a break.

Joe was concerned about whether or not we should continue on with Exum or change our plans to do the faster and more certain Owen-Spalding route. We were about 40 minutes behind schedule, and he was a little concerned about the strong winds and the clouds to the west. The winds didn&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;t seem abnormally high considering where we were, and the clouds to the east were little &amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#152;popcorn&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153; cumulus and none were developing enough height for thunderstorms &amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#147; not a concern, but something to keep an eye on.  &lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;table border=\"0\" width=\"200\"&gt;\r\n&lt;tbody&gt;\r\n&lt;tr&gt;\r\n&lt;td&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-inEkozi3NGE/TjFZCivXcSI/AAAAAAAAkDY/OsthY6T1wWg/s2000/7-16-05-20-SeaHorseClouds.jpg\" style=\"text-align:-webkit-center\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"\" border=\"2\" src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-inEkozi3NGE/TjFZCivXcSI/AAAAAAAAkDY/OsthY6T1wWg/s400/7-16-05-20-SeaHorseClouds.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;While I was getting ready to belay Joe on Wall Street, I saw some sea horses floating above me - was it a sign my sleep deprivation, or just an active imagination!?&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;/td&gt;\r\n&lt;td&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-U_AauoZWBB8/TjFZPxhh-3I/AAAAAAAAkEA/c98b4XrtizI/s2000/7-16-05-27-BuckMtn.jpg\" style=\"text-align:-webkit-center\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"\" border=\"2\" src=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-U_AauoZWBB8/TjFZPxhh-3I/AAAAAAAAkEA/c98b4XrtizI/s400/7-16-05-27-BuckMtn.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Buck Mountain seen from the base of the Golden Staircase on the Grand Teton\'s Exum Ridge.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;/td&gt;\r\n&lt;/tr&gt;\r\n&lt;/tbody&gt;\r\n&lt;/table&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;   At this point I was feeling a little sleepy as I belayed Joe, so I popped a caffeine pill to prevent \'Belayer Sleepiness (BS) syndrome\' :-D   Soon I was climbing and I quickly reached the Step Around. It was every bit exposed as I had heard. I began looking at my options for using a hand traverse, but then relented to climbing into the notch and back out, taking a photo midway through this move to capture the view.  &lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-Il6MQPrVWp8/TjFZGw9lTZI/AAAAAAAAkDo/90dme_heXZ4/s2000/7-16-05-23-LookingDownStepAround.jpg\" style=\"text-align:-webkit-center\"&gt;&lt;img border=\"2\" src=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-Il6MQPrVWp8/TjFZGw9lTZI/AAAAAAAAkDo/90dme_heXZ4/s800/7-16-05-23-LookingDownStepAround.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Ever wonder what it looks like below the Step-Around on Wall Street? Well, now you know!&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;  Next it was my turn to lead. I threw on Joe&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;s pro sling, took a look at the Golden Staircase, and headed off to the right through a series of ledges and cracks. Luckily the route didn&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;t wander too much, so rope drag was never an issue. After about 150 ft I reached a large bouldery ledge and I just took off walking. I almost made it to a nice ledge sheltered from the wind before Joe radioed that I was out of rope. We ran it out to reach the sheltered ledge, and I belayed Joe the rest of the way up.  &lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-EvVFhzUkv0U/TjFZRkXdLvI/AAAAAAAAkEE/Jj0CeDg7M6M/s2000/7-16-05-28-WindTunnel.jpg\" style=\"text-align:-webkit-center\"&gt;&lt;img border=\"2\" src=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-EvVFhzUkv0U/TjFZRkXdLvI/AAAAAAAAkEE/Jj0CeDg7M6M/s800/7-16-05-28-WindTunnel.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;The rather mediocre pitch known as the Wind Tunnel. Its really just a set of bouldering problems, although the climbing was still fun! From the large ledge above the Golden Staircase, Joe and I free-climbed over to the boulder-filled chute to the right.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;  From here the terrain was easy, so we each coiled some of the rope and free-soloed up and through a notch were we saw the obvious Wind Tunnel Pitch &amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#147; a wide chute chock full of large boulders. We scrambled partway up the chute before setting up another belay. The climbing here was fun, more like bouldering moves than sustained climbing. Although there was some ice in the chute, there was never enough to get in the way. Beyond this pitch we free-soloed again, climbing through another notch and down into another large chute. To the right was a large rocky rib, and then a chute filled with snow and ice, a steep slab, and then a rounded golden crest to our left with a lot of parallel cracks snaking up the spine.  &lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-vTruDYs-nWo/TjFZimYFiEI/AAAAAAAAkEs/zf00ZvlwuPY/s2000/7-16-05-38-FrictionPitch%2520Bypass.jpg\" style=\"text-align:-webkit-center\"&gt;&lt;img border=\"2\" src=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-vTruDYs-nWo/TjFZimYFiEI/AAAAAAAAkEs/zf00ZvlwuPY/s800/7-16-05-38-FrictionPitch%2520Bypass.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Above the Wind Tunnel we coiled our ropes and free-soloed up to a notch to the right, and back around to the left to reach this spot. Climb up the cracks on the left for a fun full pitch to reach the small Boulder Ledge at the base of the Friction Pitch - the crux of the Upper Exum Ridge. To avoid this pitch, you can also ascend the gulley to the right (often iced over, as it is in the photo), or ascend the chimney in the center corner (5.6-5.7).&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;  At this point Joe thought that we were off route. I disagreed and tried to show him certain features that matched up with some photos printed out from SP. We tried reading the route descriptions, but they were just plain confusing. I opted to lead the next pitch up the cracks to our left, as I was sure that was where the Friction Pitch was. Suddenly we heard the voices of another group climbing up the Wind Tunnel. A group of 3 climbers had already climbed the Lower Exum and were passing us! They took off up the chute to the right as Joe set up a belay and I took off up a fun crack. The terrain started out as a wide broken chimney, with more crack climbing higher up.  I ascended left toward the spine, and was treated with awesome exposure looking down the crest and then down the side of the Exum Ridge as I reached a large boulder. I climbed around this and set up a belay beneath what looked to me like the Friction Pitch.  &lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-8eiSsN90KgY/TjFZseYsQ3I/AAAAAAAAkFA/2ZSOK4wtkBc/s2000/7-16-05-43-FrictionPitch.jpg\" style=\"text-align:-webkit-center\"&gt;&lt;img border=\"2\" src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-8eiSsN90KgY/TjFZseYsQ3I/AAAAAAAAkFA/2ZSOK4wtkBc/s800/7-16-05-43-FrictionPitch.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Friction Pitch seen from Boulder Ledge. It was a little hard to follow the route description along here - but if you see rock like this, you\'re definitely on route! Climb up the groove to the right (takes a bit of pro), and double back left to two black knobs before launching up the pitch.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;  Soon Joe was up, and we determined that the small boulder-covered ledge we were on was the Boulder Ledge beneath the Friction Pitch described in the guidebooks. We located the signature black knobs above, and Joe took the next lead. Although I was attached to a single runner slung around a large boulder, I would have preferred more redundancy in an anchor here, and I was quite nervous as Joe took off. Initially he had trouble finding pro placements that wouldn&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;t rip out, but soon he had in a few pieces (whew!) and was climbing up the crux. I saw an excellent shot of him on the crest against the sky, so I asked him if he could stop for a second for a photo-op.  &lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-1S67GOMN0rk/TjFZ18lqjoI/AAAAAAAAkFU/4139I6de3Ds/s2000/7-16-05-48-LookingDownFrictionPitch.jpg\" style=\"text-align:-webkit-center\"&gt;&lt;img border=\"2\" src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-1S67GOMN0rk/TjFZ18lqjoI/AAAAAAAAkFU/4139I6de3Ds/s800/7-16-05-48-LookingDownFrictionPitch.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;My view down the Upper Exum Ridge as I neared the top of the Friction Pitch.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;  &amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#156;No!&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#157; He shouted emphatically, and kept climbing up and out of sight. Soon I followed, and I was pleased to find the nuts placed before the crux were very secure (the only time I needed my nut tool on the route). A few fun friction moves on the sharp and flaky (but not loose!) gneiss and I was on the ridge crest. The exposure was intense, but the climbing was easy and soon I was at the next belay.  &lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;table border=\"0\" width=\"200\"&gt;\r\n&lt;tbody&gt;\r\n&lt;tr&gt;\r\n&lt;td&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-ymn54RFiWHc/TjFZ5obfJtI/AAAAAAAAkFc/xE15cyFp_XI/s2000/7-16-05-50-JoeAtTop%2520of%2520FrictionPitch.jpg\" style=\"text-align:-webkit-center\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"\" border=\"2\" src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-ymn54RFiWHc/TjFZ5obfJtI/AAAAAAAAkFc/xE15cyFp_XI/s200/7-16-05-50-JoeAtTop%2520of%2520FrictionPitch.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Joe Bullough at the top of the Friction Pitch on the Upper Exum Ridge.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;/td&gt;\r\n&lt;td&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-AcPve6fwtW8/TjFZ9VrL7EI/AAAAAAAAkFk/KI36NkO_EmY/s2000/7-16-05-52-Notch%2526V-Pitch.jpg\" style=\"text-align:-webkit-center\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"\" border=\"2\" src=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-AcPve6fwtW8/TjFZ9VrL7EI/AAAAAAAAkFk/KI36NkO_EmY/s200/7-16-05-52-Notch%2526V-Pitch.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;From the top of the Friction Pitch, we coiled our ropes again and free-soloed past an exposed notch (left), up a short headwall (right), and around the east side (right) of the ridge to reach the V-Pitch (aka.

We scrambled up this and followed them to the final roped pitch of the route &amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#147; the V-Pitch. This should have been my lead, but I was feeling pretty tired, a little stressed, and I had been battling heart-burn throughout the day that just wasn&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;t going away, so I accepted Joe&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;s offer to let him lead the pitch. My mistake &amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#147; it turned out to be one of the most enjoyable pitches on the climb!  &lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;table border=\"0\" width=\"200\"&gt;\r\n&lt;tbody&gt;\r\n&lt;tr&gt;\r\n&lt;td&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-JVdDTAl3ly0/TjFaRbXza5I/AAAAAAAAkGQ/GGU_abskJwA/s2000/7-16-05-58-V-Pitch.jpg\" style=\"text-align:-webkit-center\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"\" border=\"2\" src=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-JVdDTAl3ly0/TjFaRbXza5I/AAAAAAAAkGQ/GGU_abskJwA/s400/7-16-05-58-V-Pitch.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Some climbers who caught up to us on the Exum Ridge ascending the fun V-Pitch, the last roped pitch on the route before the summit block.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;/td&gt;\r\n&lt;td&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-lZi8uq_W96E/TjFaThmtIpI/AAAAAAAAkGY/kf6s_UG_KOA/s2000/7-16-05-60-LookingDownV-Pitch.jpg\" style=\"text-align:-webkit-center\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"\" border=\"2\" src=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-lZi8uq_W96E/TjFaThmtIpI/AAAAAAAAkGY/kf6s_UG_KOA/s400/7-16-05-60-LookingDownV-Pitch.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Looking down the fun V-Pitch of the Upper Exum Ridge.

Luckily, the wind seemed to be blowing so strong that it destroyed any chance of updrafts forming larger cumulus clouds. Still, the increase in wind speed was disconcerting, especially since we had a free rappel on one rope to look forward to on our descent.    \r\n  \r\n  \r\n&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;h2&gt;\r\n&lt;a name=\"TOC-Falling-and-Rappelling---1:40-pm\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Falling and Rappelling - 1:40 pm&lt;/h2&gt;\r\n\r\nAbove the V-Pitch we ran into trouble. The guidebooks mentioned heading slightly west and ascending a left-leaning crack with an awkward lieback. The only cracks we could see looked much harder than 5.5. Perhaps if we walked up to them they wouldn&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;t have been so steep, but in our fatigue I guess the thought never occurred to us.  At this point the wind was blowing hard enough that we decided to head straight for the rappel to the Upper Saddle unless we could quickly find a way to the summit &amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#147; we were almost 2 hrs behind schedule, as it was about 1:40pm.   \r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;  At this point Joe suggested we traverse around to the easier slopes on the east side of the summit. Below us was a friction slab and a short snowfield with footprints that led to a notch in the rock step. I looked at the snowfield- it was steep and disappeared over a convexity about 20 feet further down, certainly emptying into the Beckey Couloir. I didn&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;t like the fall consequences, so I suggested we belay each other across the friction slab and 10ft long snow crossing. Joe secured my rope in his belay device and braced himself behind a boulder as I walked down to the snow.  &lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;  When I reached the snow I saw that the footprints were fairly old &amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#147; this certainly wasn&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;t where the three climbers ahead of us went. I carefully stepped onto one of the footprints, only to have it disintegrate into a hissing stream of wet snow pouring down and over the edge below. The snow was superheated. Underneath was a very hard layer of ice, which was expected since I was at the interface of snow and rock. Still, things didn&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;t seem right, but I decided to try walking in the footprints anyways, stepping on the top of the ice where it terminated into rock.  As I carefully stepped forward, each footprint disintegrated into a larger slide. Suddenly my feet flew out from underneath me and I was rocketing down a solid sheet of ice toward the Beckey Couloir and a several thousand-foot plummet.  &lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;  &amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#156;Take! Take! Take!&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#157; I shouted frantically. It felt like I slid for eternity, but I actually stopped about 10 feet below where I fell. Still my heart was pounding, and my bare hands were dug into the snow. The ice sheet was so steep and slick that I was seriously weighting the rope, and I couldn&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;t stand up. I tried to tension traverse to some rock on my left, but the sheet was too slick. I coiled the rope hand over hand to climb back up, but progress was agonizingly slow. I then tried traversing on my shins and bare forearms in slush that kept sliding away beneath me, while Joe held the tension. After a few minutes of this I was back on rock, panting in fear and surprise, and moaning and groaning from the intense pain in my bare hands from the prolonged contact with ice and snow.  &lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;  After I finished warming my hands we decided to look for the rappel. By this point I was completely sketched out and I didn&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;t feel like looking much more for a way up the summit block. We traversed down and to the west to the large ledge with the rappel. I was expecting to see a large boulder with colored slings wrapped around it at the rappel, but no such luck. It was nowhere in sight! Joe and I spent the next 20 minutes or so looking around for it to no avail. Finally, I thought I saw some white slings blowing against the cliff-side of a large boulder to the north. As we headed around to get a better look, we crossed beneath Sergeants Chimney and saw two ropes hanging down &amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#147; the three climbers were descending from the summit!  &lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;  This made me feel better, as our plan for rapping seemed less palatable now that the winds were really howling. Joe and I had brought one 60m rope and a 220 ft long retrieval cord, and we knew what to do with it, but we had never had a chance to practice with it. The idea of rapping on one rope, with the rope and retrieval cord possibly being blowing into a stuck position didn&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;t seem too appealing. We waited for the climbers to come down and then we told them where the rapp station was as we all carefully walked down the loose talus.  &lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;  &amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#156;Don&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;t worry about getting out your rope, guys. You might as well use ours,&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#157; one of the climbers said as Joe and I were preparing to stow the rope coiled around our bodies. Great! We could mooch a two-rope rappel line without the embarrassment of asking :-D  &lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;  As we came around to the rap station we saw that it was composed of some thick cordalettes attached to bolts on the backside of a large stone &amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#147; extra secure but nearly impossible to find from higher up! We all perched in line on a narrow ledge as the rap was set up. The wind kept getting stronger, and we all had to hold on. The first climber went down. He seemed to stumble as a gust hit him when he stepped below the first lip, and then he was out of sight. The line moved up and those closest to the rap anchor clipped into it for security.  &lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;  After a while the first climber radioed that he was down. It took a while to establish this as the wind was blowing so hard that we had trouble hearing the radios! The next climber went down, almost at a run and then stumbling and nearly falling over on his side as the wind buffeted him, and then he was gone. A few minutes later a radio call came in and the third climber descended. Then it was Joe&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;s turn. The intense exposure and high winds had me very nervous and anxious to get down while also dreading the impending rappel &amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#147; I imagined the wind spinning me around on the free rappel like a marionette, slamming me into the rock.  &lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;   Soon Joe was off. Later on he told me that he had had a miserable rappel. He was blown around a lot, and as he was free-hanging in front of a slab, the wind dragged him over and into a wet chimney.  &lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;  Finally it was my turn. I had never considered the tension the rope would be under when so much of it was free-hanging. I had to struggle for several minutes to get the ropes through my belay device. I had to struggle several minutes more to pull enough rope through to get a locking &amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#152;biner in. I really wanted extra friction, given the conditions, so I spent several more minutes lugging on the rope to get a second locker through the rope and ATC. The extra friction was a nice comfort to have, as the wind got worse while I rappelled. At a major ledge the wind knocked me over and pinned me down for a short while. As I continued on I saw the rope disappear into a chimney &amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#147; odd. Rather than work against the rop onto the face, I followed it into a chimney. The walls were slick and dripping with water, and gusts slammed me back and forth into the walls.  &lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;  Once I was down Joe and I organized our gear while the others pulled down their rope. Sadly, when the knot was about 50 ft above them, the end of the rope got stuck. With the rope jammed and the winds getting worse, the climbers gave up their two ropes for lost and headed down.  &lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;  Joe and I followed. The exposed move to get onto the upper saddle was a little spooky with the gusts, especially after I looked down into the Black Ice Couloir beneath my feet as I climbed over. Next we had to descend another 1,000 ft over rugged class 3-4 terrain. It was slow going, but the wind seemed to die down a bit. Finally we scrambled through the \'eye\' of The Needle, down some sketchy class 4 terrain, and we were home free on the climbers trail heading down the scree slopes &amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#147; or so I thought.    \r\n\r\n&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;h2&gt;\r\n&lt;a name=\"TOC-The-Whirlwind\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;The Whirlwind&lt;/h2&gt;\r\n\r\n The wind got even worse around the Black Dike. Dust, grit, and gravel blew into my face and ears. When the wind blew on one side of my head, the pressure differential really made my eardrums ache. The sustained gusts picked up and were so strong that I had to seriously squat, scrunch my abs, and drag my arms and legs forward to step down &amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#147; it was like walking through a river. Then the wind would reverse direction and hurl me to the ground. My legs were constantly getting torqued, and because of my fatigue, the wind knocked me down a lot. In some cases I just stayed low until the gust let up. At several points the wind dragged me along the scree as I was standing, and I had to grab boulders to stop myself. When the wind was really bad, I had to squat down and grab boulders as I walked along to steady my torso.  \r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;  This wind was driving me crazy. I was very tired and looking forward to an easier descent, but the wind made the descent harder than the ascent! For no rational reason I cursed the wind, flipped off the general direction it came from, and then it would reverse direction and spin me around. My wind shirt vibrated so hard that it made a loud humming noise as it turned into a blur of blue. At one point a gust blew both legs out from underneath me. On one moderate gust I let my limbs hang limp &amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#147; the arm blew up about 85 degrees and my leg blew up about 35 degrees! The wind seemed to alternate between a 20-30 second gust and a 10 second break. It seemed to come from everywhere &amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#147; even when I got behind large boulders it didn&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;t make a difference.  &lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;  After what seemed like an eternity, I finally caught up to Joe at our cache on the Lower Saddle. We could barely hear each other over the wind as we packed out gear. Meanwhile, Exum guides were frantically trying to secure the shelters, which hummed like a roaring river. We prayed that the wind would die down once we got off the saddle before reaching the steep snow traverse.  &lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;  As we descended the wind lessened slightly, but it still had plenty of punch. This made the snow traverse rather tiring and sketchy &amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#147; about all I could do was squat down on my axe as the gusts came down the slope. I was completely exhausted physically and mentally at this point, and all the twisting of my legs had really done a number on my knees. I moved slowly as Joe rushed on.   &lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;  I met up with Joe at the Lower Moraine Camp. The winds were still blowing hard enough to knock me down, and occasionally we&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;d get sprayed from the waterfalls pouring off of the Teepee Pillar and Disappointment Peak, several thousand feet above us. It was quite surreal to actually see the waterfalls stream &lt;big&gt;&lt;i&gt;UP&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/big&gt; the cliffs as the wind picked up!  &lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;  I continued to limp down the trail, but the wind continued its pursuit. Even at the meadows we&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;d occasionally get knocked around and sprayed with grit. As we neared the Meadow Camp I though I saw a lot of people standing around some of the boulders. It seemed rather odd, and then I noticed that they weren&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;t moving &amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#147; I was beginning to hallucinate.   &lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;  Joe and I pressed on down the hill. He had taken the wind better than I, and would race ahead and then wait around until I caught up, and then he&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;d be off again. I prodded along in a stoic daze, knees sore, feet aching, vertigo gnawing. The hallucinations continued. Usually when I get exhausted enough on a climb I experience this &amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#147; I&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;ll see patterns of color or texture that look like a person, tent, robot, etc. Rather than seeing a pattern that looks like an object, my mind seems to interpret it as the object first, and only after closer inspection would I realize that I wasn&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;t seeing what I thought I was. It did make the hike down more entertaining, though, as I tried to guess what was a hallucination and what wasn&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;t &amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#147; and if it was a hallucination, what was I really looking at?  &lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;  As the sun set this only got worse as the clarity of my vision became more muddled. The sun set just as we finished our last switchback, but rather than stop to get out the headlamps, I continued on with car fever. Joe and I hiked along in the darkness without speaking, focused on the one goal of reaching the car, following a trail that was only faintly illuminated by the moon.  As we neared the car I thought about our hike up in the dark earlier in the day and how worried Joe was about bears. For some reason he didn&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;t seem as worried now, even though we weren&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;t even hiking with headlamps turned on!   &lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;  &amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#156;Joe, why aren&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;t you worried about the bears coming down like you were this morning?&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#157; I queried.  &lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;  &amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#156;I&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;m just too tired to care,&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#157; he mumbled. It had been a long day and we both were ready for it to end. Finally, around 10:30 pm we reached the car. We had been on the move for over 21 hours, and I had been awake since 6:30 am Friday morning &amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#147; some 40 hours.  &lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;  We were exhausted, dehydrated, bloody, burned, covered in grit, and yet I felt like it was a great trip. Strangely, we finished the Upper Exum route and yet failed to summit. But we &lt;i&gt;did&lt;/i&gt; finish the route, my first major alpine climb where I made an equal contribution to the climb, and we had made it back safely.  Now it was time to rest and make plans for our next trip to the Tetons . . .     &lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;hr&gt;\r\n&lt;hr&gt;\r\n&lt;h2&gt;\r\n&lt;a name=\"TOC-Links\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Links&lt;/h2&gt;\r\n&lt;ul&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://picasaweb.google.com/105894936663116565516/20050717ExumRidgeGrandTeton?authuser=0&amp;amp;feat=directlink\"&gt;Picasa Album&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://www.summitpost.org/a-windy-day-on-the-grand-teton/170226\"&gt;SummitPost TR&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;/ul&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;/div&gt; \r\n'),(65,235,'/mountaineering/trip-reports/wyoming/gannett-peak-the-hard-way-in-one-day','Gannett Peak (Pole Creek)','Gannett Peak, the Hard Way &acirc;Â€Â“ In One Day','Trip_Report','content: &lt;div dir=\"ltr\"&gt;\r\n&lt;h1&gt;\r\n&lt;a name=\"TOC-Gannett-Peak-the-Hard-Way-In-One-Day\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Gannett Peak, the Hard Way &amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#147; In One Day&lt;/h1&gt;\r\n&lt;hr&gt;\r\n&lt;hr&gt;\r\n&lt;table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"2\" cellspacing=\"1\"&gt;\r\n&lt;tbody&gt;\r\n&lt;tr&gt;\r\n&lt;td width=\"40%\"&gt;\r\n&lt;font color=\"gray\"&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\nStats&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/font&gt;\r\n&lt;ul&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;Routes:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href=\"http://www.summitpost.org/route/155536/pole-creek-trail-seneca-lake-trail-india.html\"&gt; Pole Creek Trail&lt;/a&gt;\r\n&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;Elevation Gained:&lt;/b&gt; ca. 10,200&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;RT Distance:&lt;/b&gt; 40 miles&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;RT Time:&lt;/b&gt; 23 hr 20 min&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;Trailhead:&lt;/b&gt; Pole Creek TH/  Elkhart Park&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;TH Elevation:&lt;/b&gt; 9,360&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;Max Elev.

Last year I had posed the idea to him and his rather condescending assumption that the peak could not be dayhiked spurred my interest in attempting such a feat. Originally, though, the idea was inspired by &lt;a href=\"http://www.summitpost.org/user_page.php?user_id=276\"&gt;Bob Burd&lt;/a&gt; and the fun days I had had with him on the &lt;a href=\"http://www.snwburd.com/bob/challenge/2005/\"&gt;Sierra Challenge&lt;/a&gt;. Comparing the logistics, if I could take 10 days of the Challenge, then I certainly could dayhike Gannett Peak. It certainly wouldn&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;t be a walk in the park, though &amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#147; with just over 40 miles round trip and over 10,000 ft of elevation gain, I would need to travel fast and ultra-light to be able to do the hike. Also, I needed a partner.\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n	\r\nSomehow all I had to do was mention the trip one day to my friend Joel Wilson and he happily volunteered to fly out to Salt Lake City with me to climb the peak and attempt the WURL (Wasatch Ultimate Ridge Linkup), another sick and twisted goal of mine. On August 20th we flew from Oakland to Salt Lake City, and after an unfortunate delay in finishing a final assignment for my summer architecture studio, we were racing north, hoping to reach the trailhead by our planned start time of 12:00 am. It looked like we might be late, and we definitely would be sleep-deprived &amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#147; definitely NOT a good way to start out the climb.\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\nLuckily Joel and I made good time driving across Wyoming, and by 11pm we were driving up the mountain road above Fremont Lake. As we approached one turn in the road we noticed an eerie orange glow &amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#147; obviously there was a huge fire around the bend. As we got closer it became apparent that we would be traveling right through the inferno.  &amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#156;Great,&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#157; we joked to each other, &amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#156;we were going to be on time to the trailhead, but now we&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;re going to be delayed by burning wreckage on the road.&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#157;  Luckily the fire was merely a brush fire alongside the road. Some teenagers had already called it in, so I did the touristy thing and took pictures. As we continued on we could feel the heat of the fire inside the car.\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;h2&gt;\r\n&lt;a name=\"TOC-Midnight-Departure\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Midnight Departure&lt;/h2&gt;\r\n\r\nWe reached the trailhead at 11:30 pm and had just enough time to eat a light breakfast and throw on our packs before starting exactly at midnight. We were both traveling very light, with packs weighing barely 20lbs. Together we brought 1 bivvy sack, one small first aid kit, crampons, helmets, ice axes, 2 fleece jackets and shells, sunscreen, sunglasses, camera, headlamps, cell phones, maps, compass, 1 sausage, a few granola bars, 4 liters of water, and about 20 packages of GU.\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\nWe started off extremely fast, practically running up the trail. The small world illuminated by my headlamp gave me a sense of tunnel vision, as it was mostly a white blur, with occasional rocks and roots, barely discernable, moving through my field of vision. I did my best to hop and skip over them, but the lack of depth perception with my LED headlamp caused regular tripping and cursing, but with each stumble I maintained my momentum and kept my stride fast.  By 1:30 am we had reached Photographers Point, nearly 5 miles up the trail.  \r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\nNext we had a long downhill portion that took forever. Larger rocks made hiking downhill at 4 mph difficult, and after a significant jarring to our knees, Joel and I quickly ascended back up to Seneca Lake, reaching the far shore by 3am. So far so good.\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\nThe hiking was tedious at times, as hills seemed to come at random, with no end in sight for their ascent or descent, but I did my best to match the terrain to the topo map in my head to determine our progress.  Overall though, the terrain flew by, and at 4:40 am we reached Island Lake. Joel commented on a nice looking beach that we should soak on feet in on the way back and then we began a final climb to the Titcomb lakes. Beyond the lower outlet, the trail began to fade and was often interrupted by marshes and stream crossings, so in the dark, our speed slowed. By about 6am we reached the far shore of the upper lake.\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\nWhile I took my time refilling my water, Joel announced he was taking off on the cross-country portion, but would go slow so that I could catch up. I hiked quickly up the grassy meadows and rocky slabs, but Joel was nowhere it sight. At one point I came across some campers tending some goats (?!) that tried to follow me, to their annoyance. Eventually I crossed the permanent snowfield trickling down from Mt Helens and sat on a prominent rock to wait for Joel, as I assumed that I had passed him in the maze of talus.\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"http://www.summitpost.org/image/218435/154058/mount-helen-at-sunrise.html\" style=\"text-align:-webkit-center\"&gt;&lt;img border=\"2\" src=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-skTyZp-4mQA/TjDU1yhd5FI/AAAAAAAAfSg/4eNwWbXVFTo/s800/2006-08-21%2520-%2520Gannett%2520Pk%252002%2520-%2520Mt%2520Helen%2520from%2520Bonney%2520Pass.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Mount Helen at Sunrise&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\nA few minutes later Joel appeared and we began the first grueling climb of our hike to gain Bonney Pass. Oddly, we hadn&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;t seen any signs of hikers ahead of us, and yet we were certain that people must be attempting Gannett Peak that day. The rocks were surprisingly solid, and before we knew it, we had reached windy Bonney Pass.\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;h2&gt;\r\n&lt;a name=\"TOC-7:30-am---Bonney-Pass-Almost-There-\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;7:30 am - Bonney Pass &amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#147; Almost There?&lt;/h2&gt;\r\n&amp;Acirc;&amp;nbsp;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-WWEiCI62rl4/TjDVQKBzpgI/AAAAAAAAfTg/aVvKbNRf9po/s2000/2006-08-21%2520-%2520Gannett%2520Pk%252006%2520-%2520Sphinx%2526WoodrowWilson%2520-%2520Labeled.jpg\" style=\"text-align:-webkit-center\"&gt;&lt;img border=\"2\" src=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-WWEiCI62rl4/TjDVQKBzpgI/AAAAAAAAfTg/aVvKbNRf9po/s800/2006-08-21%2520-%2520Gannett%2520Pk%252006%2520-%2520Sphinx%2526WoodrowWilson%2520-%2520Labeled.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Spinx and Mt Woodrow Wilson&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\nUpon reaching the pass I had escaped from my tunnel vision and for the first time on our hike I finally began to look around. I immediately whipped out my camera and started snapping away. The terrain was gorgeous! Behind us the ground dropped away steeply to the Titcomb Lakes, above which were some immense granite walls rising up to Mt Helen, Mt Sacajawea, and Fremont Pk. In front of us the terrain dropped away again to the huge Dinwoody Glacier and Gannett Peak beyond. I was surprised at the immensity of the glacier, and the prominence of the peaks lining it. \r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-IuAOUiq_tTA/TjDU6SjRajI/AAAAAAAAfSs/wm54pCrJJC8/s800/2006-08-21%2520-%2520Gannett%2520Pk%252005%2520-%2520Gannet%2520Pk%2520from%2520Bonney%2520Pass.jpg\" style=\"text-align:-webkit-center\"&gt;&lt;img border=\"2\" src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-IuAOUiq_tTA/TjDU6SjRajI/AAAAAAAAfSs/wm54pCrJJC8/s800/2006-08-21%2520-%2520Gannett%2520Pk%252005%2520-%2520Gannet%2520Pk%2520from%2520Bonney%2520Pass.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Gannett Peak seen from Bonney Pass. Still a long ways to go . . .&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\nThe traverse looked longer than expected, and Joel commented that we were behind schedule. How far were we really from the summit? I optimistically said that we were only 2.5 hours from the summit &amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#147; a half hour to descend from the pass, a half hour to cross the glacier, and an hour and a half to ascend the peak. But how long did we really have to reach the summit? Our speed was obviously slowing as sleep deprivation began to slow us down. Already my body kept demanding rest so that I could drift off to sleep, but at the moment I could keep the urging pretty well at bay. Still, I could tell that the dizziness and fatigue from the lack of sleep would be a major difficulty later.\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-SeLIJcbHa-M/TjDWnn4_nHI/AAAAAAAAfW0/lpcdRg7Sl9A/s2000/2006-08-21%2520-%2520Gannett%2520Pk%252008%2520-%2520Dinwoody%2520Glacier%2520-%2520Labeled.jpg\" style=\"text-align:-webkit-center\"&gt;&lt;img border=\"2\" src=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-SeLIJcbHa-M/TjDWnn4_nHI/AAAAAAAAfW0/lpcdRg7Sl9A/s800/2006-08-21%2520-%2520Gannett%2520Pk%252008%2520-%2520Dinwoody%2520Glacier%2520-%2520Labeled.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Dinwoody Glacier&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\nThe descent to the glacier went by quickly, but the loose rock on this side of Bonney Pass promised to be a major pain upon our return. Joel and I reached the glacier, donned our crampons, and began traversing while keeping a sharp eye out for crevasses. Luckily the snow cover seemed to be pretty well melted out, fully exposing any dangerous crevasses. The crunchy pocketed ice on the surface hinted that the glacier would turn to slush later in the day &amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#147; all the better to hurry back.\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"http://www.summitpost.org/image/218466/150362/west-sentinel.html\" style=\"text-align:-webkit-center\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;table border=\"0\" width=\"200\"&gt;\r\n&lt;tbody&gt;\r\n&lt;tr&gt;\r\n&lt;td&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-jDnR5zYQui4/TjDVCR-qBGI/AAAAAAAAfTA/tc-ZH0tYvEU/s2000/2006-08-21%2520-%2520Gannett%2520Pk%252009%2520-%2520West%2520Sentinel.jpg\" style=\"text-align:-webkit-center\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"\" border=\"2\" src=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-jDnR5zYQui4/TjDVCR-qBGI/AAAAAAAAfTA/tc-ZH0tYvEU/s400/2006-08-21%2520-%2520Gannett%2520Pk%252009%2520-%2520West%2520Sentinel.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;West Sentinel&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;/td&gt;\r\n&lt;td&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/--OcW5J718Ns/TjDVHhIUHNI/AAAAAAAAfTM/fxWthzObJkI/s2000/2006-08-21%2520-%2520Gannett%2520Pk%252011%2520-%2520Dinwoody%2520Glacier.jpg\" style=\"text-align:-webkit-center\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"\" border=\"2\" src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/--OcW5J718Ns/TjDVHhIUHNI/AAAAAAAAfTM/fxWthzObJkI/s400/2006-08-21%2520-%2520Gannett%2520Pk%252011%2520-%2520Dinwoody%2520Glacier.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Cool Gendarmes above Dinwoody Glacier\r\n  &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;/td&gt;\r\n&lt;/tr&gt;\r\n&lt;/tbody&gt;\r\n&lt;/table&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\nAbout halfway across the glacier Joel began to crash. He slowed up, but I continued to hike on, eager to get this leg of the journey over with. After reaching the second cleaver in the glacier, I had fun catwalking along the edge of the glacier and an immense moat, some 200 feet across and over 100 feet deep! A crossed another thin sliver of the glacier to reach the base of the Gooseneck Pinnacle. A 50 foot deep overhanging moat barred, progress, but a little further up the glacier I climbed onto class three rock to traverse over to the pinnacle ridge. Joel joined me at 8:30 am and we began the irritating routine of taking our crampons and axe back off.\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-JwrVsRSZh-s/TjDVJFN7B-I/AAAAAAAAfTQ/KnGpDwGrodk/s2000/2006-08-21%2520-%2520Gannett%2520Pk%252014%2520-%2520Gooseneck%2520Pinnacle%2520%2526%2520Gannett%2520Pk.jpg\" style=\"text-align:-webkit-center\"&gt;&lt;img border=\"2\" src=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-JwrVsRSZh-s/TjDVJFN7B-I/AAAAAAAAfTQ/KnGpDwGrodk/s800/2006-08-21%2520-%2520Gannett%2520Pk%252014%2520-%2520Gooseneck%2520Pinnacle%2520%2526%2520Gannett%2520Pk.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fun Class 3 Slabs Below the Gooseneck Pinnacle&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\nAfter a short bit of class 2 scrambling I reached the Goosneck Glacier. Ahead of me was a huge convexity in the glacier, shattering the ice into an impassable maze of crevasses and seracs. To my left, though, were some clean and fun class 3 slabs leading around this slow-motion waterfall of ice. The climbing was exposed and the scenery beautiful and I bypassed the glacier. Soon I was at the base of the Gooseneck Pinnacle, which barred further progress on the ridge &amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#147; time again to don the crampons and ice axe to continue around on the glacier.\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;h2&gt;\r\n&lt;a name=\"TOC-9:30-am---Crux-at-the-Bergschrund\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;9:30 am - Crux at the Bergschrund&lt;/h2&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;As Joel and I rounded the Gooseneck, we kept looking for the impassable bergschrund we had heard about. Joel had called into the ranger station earlier in the week and had learned that the &amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#152;schrund was supposedly impassable by now. The few people summiting were climbing around to the left via some low 5th class rock. We could see a direct snow couloir splitting the south east face of Gannett Peak and assumed this was our line &amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#147; yet there was no bergschrund in sight. &lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n  \r\n  A few hundred feet later, though, we could see that our snow climb was to our left, directly behind the Gooseneck, and there was indeed a gaping bergschrund blocking passage to all of the snow lines leading above the Goosneck Glacier.  As we approached the steep snow chute I looked at the supposed 5.1 rock to the left of the &amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#152;schrund &amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#147; it didn&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;t look like 5.1 to me! \r\n  &lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n  \r\n  I carefully walked up to the edge of the bergschrund and looked around. To my left the snow dropped about 5 feet down until the glacier pinched back into the rock, where the bypass was located. To my right there was a snow bridge about 8 feet above me, with a huge cavern beneath, dark blue and lined with sinister icicles. Above the bridge there was a wall of snow some 10 feet high that looked rather impassable. Ahead of me was a drop of about 4 feet to a snow bridge of unknown thickness with a few imbedded boulders. About 10 feet away was a rock wall covered with a veneer of ice several inches thick and a sliver of a snow ledge draping down from the snow chute to the ice wall.\r\n  &lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-Qru7nFE_n8s/TjDVTZofGnI/AAAAAAAAfTo/YQ-or2zT2Kk/s2000/2006-08-21%2520-%2520Gannett%2520Pk%252016%2520-%2520Joel%2520on%2520Berg.jpg\" style=\"text-align:-webkit-center\"&gt;&lt;img border=\"2\" src=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-Qru7nFE_n8s/TjDVTZofGnI/AAAAAAAAfTo/YQ-or2zT2Kk/s800/2006-08-21%2520-%2520Gannett%2520Pk%252016%2520-%2520Joel%2520on%2520Berg.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Joel bypassing the bergschrund.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n  &amp;Acirc;&amp;nbsp; &lt;br&gt;\r\n  After some debating as to whether we should try the crossing, Joel gingerly poked at the snow bridge and started across. So far so good. Upon reaching the ice wall he hacking the pick of his axe into the ice and proceeded to kick steps into the ice. A few minutes later he was at the snow sliver, staying off of it as much as possible as he traversed up and left onto the snow slopes above. Once he was through I followed. I held my breath and walked quickly and lightly across the bridge and sank my ice tool into the veneer. The ice was pleasantly plastic and secure. I gingerly sidestepped over, moving my tool with me in the ice, hacking away with pleasure, and before I knew it I was on the snow. The crux was over, but now we were worried about getting down &amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#147; how solid would the snowbridge be after a few more hours of sunlight?\r\n  &lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-WvUtJJKg9Sk/TjDVa-925QI/AAAAAAAAfT8/iNfWvzhNOf8/s2000/2006-08-21%2520-%2520Gannett%2520Pk%252020%2520-%2520Upper%2520Dinwoody%2520Glacier%2520-%2520Labeled.jpg\" style=\"text-align:-webkit-center\"&gt;&lt;img border=\"2\" src=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-WvUtJJKg9Sk/TjDVa-925QI/AAAAAAAAfT8/iNfWvzhNOf8/s800/2006-08-21%2520-%2520Gannett%2520Pk%252020%2520-%2520Upper%2520Dinwoody%2520Glacier%2520-%2520Labeled.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Upper Dinwoody Glacier&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&amp;Acirc;&amp;nbsp;&amp;Acirc;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n  \r\n  Anyways, onward we went, climbing up a nice sun-cupped snow slope some 45 degrees steep. Soon we were at the backside of the Gooseneck Pinnacle. After stripping off our crampons and axes, we continued a short ways further, traversing to the right of the ridge on class 2 ledges before caching much of our gear. \r\n  &lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-kbFVmfgxYyY/TjDVi9V0ahI/AAAAAAAAfUY/Tu_xcza3ZOU/s2000/2006-08-21%2520-%2520Gannett%2520Pk%252023%2520-%2520Dinwoody%2520Peak%2520%2526%2520Others%2520-%2520Labeled.jpg\" style=\"text-align:-webkit-center\"&gt;&lt;img border=\"2\" src=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-kbFVmfgxYyY/TjDVi9V0ahI/AAAAAAAAfUY/Tu_xcza3ZOU/s800/2006-08-21%2520-%2520Gannett%2520Pk%252023%2520-%2520Dinwoody%2520Peak%2520%2526%2520Others%2520-%2520Labeled.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Some rugged summits&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n  \r\n  I was tired, so I sat down while Joel ran ahead. When I was good and ready I followed. Partway up onto the final summit ridge, I heard yelling. Behind me on the ridge between Glacier Pass and Gannett Peak was a lone climber. I yelled a greeting back and continued on, pondering what route he took to get onto that ridge.\r\n  &lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n  \r\n  Joel had mentioned that the final ridge was exposed class 3, but it didn&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;t appear that way to me. For fun I decided to use my hands as little as possible, to see if I could keep the route class 2. I found that at every class 3 move there was a class 2 bypass, and soon I reached the summit at the same time as Joel. It was 11:05 am, about an hour later than we had planned on summitting.\r\n  &lt;br&gt;\r\n&amp;Acirc;&amp;nbsp;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;table border=\"0\" width=\"200\"&gt;\r\n&lt;tbody&gt;\r\n&lt;tr&gt;\r\n&lt;td&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-_5baoYbKmSs/TjDWX3k4TQI/AAAAAAAAfWQ/D8yjMVD42J8/s2000/2006-08-21%2520-%2520Gannett%2520Pk%252026%2520-%2520Summit%2520View%2520SSE%2520-%2520Labeled.jpg\" style=\"text-align:-webkit-center\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"\" border=\"2\" src=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-_5baoYbKmSs/TjDWX3k4TQI/AAAAAAAAfWQ/D8yjMVD42J8/s400/2006-08-21%2520-%2520Gannett%2520Pk%252026%2520-%2520Summit%2520View%2520SSE%2520-%2520Labeled.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Summit View SSE&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;/td&gt;\r\n&lt;td&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-z6bxsHdFvoI/TjDWWSMiPDI/AAAAAAAAfWM/MdTQJFtY3kU/s2000/2006-08-21%2520-%2520Gannett%2520Pk%252027%2520-%2520Summit%2520View%2520S%2520-%2520Labeled.jpg\" style=\"text-align:-webkit-center\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"\" border=\"2\" src=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-z6bxsHdFvoI/TjDWWSMiPDI/AAAAAAAAfWM/MdTQJFtY3kU/s400/2006-08-21%2520-%2520Gannett%2520Pk%252027%2520-%2520Summit%2520View%2520S%2520-%2520Labeled.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Summit View South&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;/td&gt;\r\n&lt;/tr&gt;\r\n&lt;/tbody&gt;\r\n&lt;/table&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;table border=\"0\" width=\"200\"&gt;\r\n&lt;tbody&gt;\r\n&lt;tr&gt;\r\n&lt;td&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-BXc2R0n02Uw/TjDWZvzofJI/AAAAAAAAfWU/iBwsdesqng4/s2000/2006-08-21%2520-%2520Gannett%2520Pk%252028%2520-%2520Summit%2520View%2520SSW%2520-%2520Labeled.jpg\" style=\"text-align:-webkit-center\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"\" border=\"2\" src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-BXc2R0n02Uw/TjDWZvzofJI/AAAAAAAAfWU/iBwsdesqng4/s240/2006-08-21%2520-%2520Gannett%2520Pk%252028%2520-%2520Summit%2520View%2520SSW%2520-%2520Labeled.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Summit View SSW&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;/td&gt;\r\n&lt;td&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-Q6V_HxbvOnE/TjDWg5EZo_I/AAAAAAAAfWk/Qbr2kDo-XEI/s2000/2006-08-21%2520-%2520Gannett%2520Pk%252029%2520-%2520Summit%2520View%2520SW%2520-%2520Labeled.jpg\" style=\"text-align:-webkit-center\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"\" border=\"2\" src=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-Q6V_HxbvOnE/TjDWg5EZo_I/AAAAAAAAfWk/Qbr2kDo-XEI/s240/2006-08-21%2520-%2520Gannett%2520Pk%252029%2520-%2520Summit%2520View%2520SW%2520-%2520Labeled.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Summit View SW&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;/td&gt;\r\n&lt;td&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-8yo8P-2_XqQ/TjDWdTecm9I/AAAAAAAAfWc/eGCEYEFlMDg/s2000/2006-08-21%2520-%2520Gannett%2520Pk%252030%2520-%2520Summit%2520View%2520W%2520-%2520Labeled.jpg\" style=\"text-align:-webkit-center\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"\" border=\"2\" src=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-8yo8P-2_XqQ/TjDWdTecm9I/AAAAAAAAfWc/eGCEYEFlMDg/s240/2006-08-21%2520-%2520Gannett%2520Pk%252030%2520-%2520Summit%2520View%2520W%2520-%2520Labeled.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Summit View W&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;/td&gt;\r\n&lt;/tr&gt;\r\n&lt;/tbody&gt;\r\n&lt;/table&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;Acirc;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;h2&gt;\r\n&lt;a name=\"TOC-11:30-am---The-Long-Return-to-Bonney-Pass\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;11:30 am - The Long Return to Bonney Pass&lt;/h2&gt;\r\n\r\nThe prospect of returning to Bonney Pass looked rather unappealing to us now, so we took a good long break on the summit. After a half-hour we faced reality and began our long trek back to the trailhead. While we were behind our preferred schedule, it still looked like we would be back to the trailhead before midnight. Our trip should be a success if only we could keep ourselves moving.\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\nPartway along the summit ridge we met the lone climber. He had come from the east, but after talking with several parties that had been deterred by the bergschrund, he had somehow climbed the Dinwoody Glacier to the south of the Goosneck Pinnacle and ascended a chute to the north of Glacier Pass! He reported that the chute was steep enough that he didn&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;t want to downclimb it and was eager to learn how we got past the &amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#152;schrund. After a brief chat (we learned that this was his 49th highpoint), he continued on the summit and we picked up the pace on our descent. \r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\nThe snow slope above the &amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#152;schrund was soft but not too bad, and soon we were back to the class 3 slabs beneath the Gooseneck Pinnacle. By this time both Joel and I were crashing. Occasionally a GU would recharge the system, but we were constantly slowing down and speeding up. \r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n	\r\nWe reached the Dinwoody Glacier at 1:30 pm, and already thunderheads were building in the sky. Occasional rockfall could be heard in the distance, but the unmistakable sound of thunder had me psyched to get across the glacier and over Bonney Pass as soon as possible. Joel fell behind as I raced across the glacier. My pace was still slow, but constant, and I made it all the way across the glacier without stopping. After a brief break at the base of the talus slope, Joel caught up and by 3pm we were at Bonney Pass. Luckily by this time the thunderheads had begun to dissipate, but it was getting late in the day and we still had a long way to go.\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\nAmazingly the descent into Titcomb Basin took longer than the climb out of it as the rock turned out to be a major pain to scramble down. I suggested to Joel that we take a half-hour nap at the meadows above the Titcomb Lakes to stave off our dizziness and he happily agreed. Now it was my turn to crash and Joel dashed off towards the Titcomb Lakes.\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;h2&gt;\r\n&lt;a name=\"TOC-5-pm---What-Have-We-Done-\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;5 pm - What Have We Done?!&lt;/h2&gt;\r\n\r\nWe reached upper Titcomb Lake at 5pm and collapsed. Off came the shoes and socks. Water was refilled, appetites were satiated, but we both agreed that we felt good enough to forgo sleep and start hiking out.

Still, I was in a bit of a daze that left me uncertain as to whether I could maintain a continuously fast pace, so I insisted that Joel lead on. \r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"http://www.summitpost.org/image/218711/171223/mt-sacajawea-and-fremont-peak.html\" style=\"text-align:-webkit-center\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;table border=\"0\" width=\"200\"&gt;\r\n&lt;tbody&gt;\r\n&lt;tr&gt;\r\n&lt;td&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-qExOyKasgHo/TjDV3lXpAiI/AAAAAAAAfVM/Q7YEfi-JbWM/s2000/2006-08-21%2520-%2520Gannett%2520Pk%252037%2520-%2520Mt%2520Sacajawea%2520%2526%2520Fremont%2520Pk%2520-%2520Labeled.jpg\" style=\"text-align:-webkit-center\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"\" border=\"2\" src=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-qExOyKasgHo/TjDV3lXpAiI/AAAAAAAAfVM/Q7YEfi-JbWM/s240/2006-08-21%2520-%2520Gannett%2520Pk%252037%2520-%2520Mt%2520Sacajawea%2520%2526%2520Fremont%2520Pk%2520-%2520Labeled.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Mt Sacajawea and Fremont Peak&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;/td&gt;\r\n&lt;td&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-R_cj2EGY6Ms/TjDWACxRlZI/AAAAAAAAfVc/NoRK2_wCUaI/s2000/2006-08-21%2520-%2520Gannett%2520Pk%252041%2520-%2520Mt%2520Sacajawea.jpg\" style=\"text-align:-webkit-center\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"\" border=\"2\" src=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-R_cj2EGY6Ms/TjDWACxRlZI/AAAAAAAAfVc/NoRK2_wCUaI/s240/2006-08-21%2520-%2520Gannett%2520Pk%252041%2520-%2520Mt%2520Sacajawea.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Mt Sacajawea&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;/td&gt;\r\n&lt;td&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-xqsk5txX8dY/TjDWCZdAm8I/AAAAAAAAfVg/E5HmSYHR5TA/s2000/2006-08-21%2520-%2520Gannett%2520Pk%252042%2520-%2520Fremont%2520Pk.jpg\" style=\"text-align:-webkit-center\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"\" border=\"2\" src=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-xqsk5txX8dY/TjDWCZdAm8I/AAAAAAAAfVg/E5HmSYHR5TA/s240/2006-08-21%2520-%2520Gannett%2520Pk%252042%2520-%2520Fremont%2520Pk.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fremont Peak from Titcomb Basin&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;/td&gt;\r\n&lt;/tr&gt;\r\n&lt;/tbody&gt;\r\n&lt;/table&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n In daylight the trail seemed to pass by faster for me, as I could see where we were going. I was glad to be returning in daylight as we had missed scenery along the trail on the approach, and what scenery! By 6:40 pm we passed Island Lake and by 8pm we had passed Seneca Lake. The terrain whizzed by as we began jogging the downhill portions to make better time. The sun was beginning to set, but the trailhead was almost within reach!\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\nThe final climb to Photographer&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;s Point took forever, and Joel&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;s pace dwindled to almost nothing. He thought he was through. Waving me on to finish the hike by midnight, Joel stopped for a break. Still, he wasn&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;t far behind me and by 10 pm we had both passed Photographers Point. 2 hours left and 5 miles to go.\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\nI raced down the trail, looking for every opportunity to pinpoint my location to determine if I should speed up. I occasionally tried to jog, but this proved unwise in the dark as I couldn&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;t see the trail too well even when lit by my headlamp.\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\nI was certain that I should be at the trailhead by 10:45 pm, but as it reached 11:15 pm I became increasingly worried that I had accidentally taken the wrong trail at the last junction. A compass bearing proved this idea false, but the aching in my feet made time pass slowly enough that I was certainly that I should have reached the trailhead a while ago. A few minutes later another compass bearing led only to confusion. Worried about continuing on but not wanting to turn back, I laid to do decide what I was to do, as time was running out. To my joy, as I was dozing Joel&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;s lamp suddenly appeared on the trail! He couldn&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;t have made the same mistake I did, so I lept up and continued hiking. Apparently I had stopped a mere 100 ft from the end of the trail, and we reached the parking lot at 11:36 pm.\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\nWe had successfully dayhiked Gannett Peak, and it only took 23.5 hours! We crashed at the trailhead and the next afternoon we were back in Salt Lake debating whether to attempt my next major project &amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#147; the Wasatch Ultimate Ridge Linkup.  The decision to attempt this ungodly traverse this weekend is still up in the air, but Gannett Peak seemingly left me only slightly fatigued. We will know tomorrow if Gannett Peak was our climb of the month, or merely a warm-up for the more difficult WURL climb.\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"http://www.summitpost.org/image/218728/171223/wind-rivers-overlook.html\" style=\"text-align:-webkit-center\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;table border=\"0\" width=\"200\"&gt;\r\n&lt;tbody&gt;\r\n&lt;tr&gt;\r\n&lt;td&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-Hjz2gkvKfLM/TjDWLqhmpaI/AAAAAAAAfV0/Y7zeboIBOvU/s2000/2006-08-21%2520-%2520Gannett%2520Pk%252049%2520-%2520Overlook%25203%2520-%2520Labeled.jpg\" style=\"text-align:-webkit-center\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"\" border=\"2\" src=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-Hjz2gkvKfLM/TjDWLqhmpaI/AAAAAAAAfV0/Y7zeboIBOvU/s240/2006-08-21%2520-%2520Gannett%2520Pk%252049%2520-%2520Overlook%25203%2520-%2520Labeled.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Wind Rivers Overlook&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;/td&gt;\r\n&lt;td&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-lUfGzSz-VQs/TjDWU4o75lI/AAAAAAAAfWI/3bCube2aBHQ/s2000/2006-08-21%2520-%2520Gannett%2520Pk%252048%2520-%2520Overlook%25202%2520-%2520Labeled.jpg\" style=\"text-align:-webkit-center\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"\" border=\"2\" src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-lUfGzSz-VQs/TjDWU4o75lI/AAAAAAAAfWI/3bCube2aBHQ/s240/2006-08-21%2520-%2520Gannett%2520Pk%252048%2520-%2520Overlook%25202%2520-%2520Labeled.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Wind Rivers Overlook&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;/td&gt;\r\n&lt;td&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-I72tqFcXE-4/TjDWQ0Ij7LI/AAAAAAAAfWA/yj_Q495uFvE/s2000/2006-08-21%2520-%2520Gannett%2520Pk%252047%2520-%2520Overlook%25201%2520-%2520Labeled.jpg\" style=\"text-align:-webkit-center\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"\" border=\"2\" src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-I72tqFcXE-4/TjDWQ0Ij7LI/AAAAAAAAfWA/yj_Q495uFvE/s240/2006-08-21%2520-%2520Gannett%2520Pk%252047%2520-%2520Overlook%25201%2520-%2520Labeled.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fremont Peak from Elkhart Park&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;/td&gt;\r\n&lt;/tr&gt;\r\n&lt;/tbody&gt;\r\n&lt;/table&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;hr&gt;\r\nUpdate - Gannett Peak turned out to be our climb of the month.

Yet it is a beautiful peak with an incredibly symmetric east ridge that is often touted by veterans of the Sierra as one of the finest scrambles in the range. The route is like the East Ridge of Mount Russell, but on steroids &amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#147; and the people who climb it are like other climbers who frequent the area, but on crack. It is extremely knife edged with sustained and exposed class 3 friction and crack climbing interrupted by occasional class 4 obstacles. (&lt;a href=\"http://www.climber.org/Secor/heller.html\"&gt;Some people&lt;/a&gt; insist that some of the moves approach mid-5th in difficulty). Technically the route is only class 3-4, but in winter conditions I found the route to be far harder and scarier than the 5.5 East Ridge of Mt Humphreys that I had climbed a month earlier. In fact the crux pitch was the scariest pitch I have climbed to date!\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\nThe East Ridge is also listed as one of the 100 Classic Climbs of the High Sierra, yet few people have climbed this route. Why?  The route isn&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;t done that often due to the difficulty in even reaching the peak. It is situated on a remote section of the Sierra Crest between Mount Russell and Mount Williamson and is most easily approached via two ways, both of which require extensive cross country travel and over 5,000 ft of gain to reach the base of the East Ridge: \r\n\r\n&lt;ol&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;Starting from Whitney Portal, leave the trail at the Boy Scout Lakes and climb Cleaver or Carillon Pass, drop down to Tulainyo Lake, climb Vacation Pass, and drop down to reach the route. Then you have climb back through Cleaver or Carillon Pass to get back out. \r\n&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;Joyous George Creek Approach from 6,500&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;. The first couple of miles are generally &amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#152;unpleasant&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#152; due to a little bit of bushwacking. ;-)  4WD high clearance vehicles are helpful for making it all the way to the TH.\r\n&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;/ol&gt;\r\n\r\nThe final (and most critical) obstacle for reaching the peak (for those who are law-abiding) is the Bighorn Sheep Closure. This closure banned access to the area for all of the year except the short windows of December 15-31 and April 15-May15. Until this year!\r\n&lt;div&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&amp;Acirc;&amp;nbsp;\r\n\r\n\r\n&lt;h2&gt;\r\n&lt;a name=\"TOC-Is-the-Finest-Scramble-Even-Better-in-Winter-\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Is the Finest Scramble Even Better in Winter?&lt;/h2&gt;\r\n\r\nThe idea of the winter climb took place way back in May 7 of 2006 when I joined Bob Burd on my first trip up George Creek. Although I climbed other peaks that day and never saw Carl Heller Peak, it was on that trip that Bob backed off on doing the route after seeing that it was covered in snow, but not without taking an inspirational photograph of the snow covered ridge. \r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;table&gt;\r\n&lt;tbody&gt;\r\n&lt;tr&gt;\r\n&lt;td&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://www.snwburd.com/bob/trip_photos/tunnabora_1/reg/tunnabora.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img height=\"300\" src=\"http://www.snwburd.com/bob/trip_photos/tunnabora_1/reg/tunnabora.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;/td&gt;\r\n&lt;/tr&gt;\r\n&lt;tr&gt;\r\n&lt;td&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;My inspiration for the climb&amp;Acirc;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;(Photo by Bob Burd)&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;/td&gt;\r\n&lt;/tr&gt;\r\n&lt;/tbody&gt;\r\n&lt;/table&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;table&gt;\r\n&lt;tbody&gt;\r\n&lt;tr&gt;\r\n&lt;td&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-YKQQsikiBHY/Tm-pxrm7GmI/AAAAAAACSVQ/MKnhthEdIAA/s2000/Mt%2520Carl%2520Heller-from%2520John%2520Moynier-citation.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-YKQQsikiBHY/Tm-pxrm7GmI/AAAAAAACSVQ/MKnhthEdIAA/s300/Mt%2520Carl%2520Heller-from%2520John%2520Moynier-citation.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;/td&gt;\r\n&lt;td&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-5C4JnxKY7YA/Tm-pydiipcI/AAAAAAACs_Y/2lxf7yeqXRU/s2000/Mt%2520Carl%2520Heller-from%2520John%2520Moynier-citation-annotation.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-5C4JnxKY7YA/Tm-pydiipcI/AAAAAAACs_Y/2lxf7yeqXRU/s300/Mt%2520Carl%2520Heller-from%2520John%2520Moynier-citation-annotation.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;/td&gt;\r\n&lt;/tr&gt;\r\n&lt;tr&gt;\r\n&lt;td&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;&lt;b&gt;The beautifully symmetric East Ridge of Carl Heller.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;/td&gt;\r\n&lt;td&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;&lt;b&gt;With annotations by me.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;/td&gt;\r\n&lt;/tr&gt;\r\n&lt;tr&gt;\r\n&lt;td colspan=\"2\"&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Photographed &amp;amp; shared with permission by John Moynier&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;/td&gt;\r\n&lt;/tr&gt;\r\n&lt;/tbody&gt;\r\n&lt;/table&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;div&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;/div&gt;\r\n\r\n\r\nI was strongly taken by the image &amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#147; an incredible knife-edged ridgeline that jutted up out of the cirque like a rock palisade emanating from the peak, with snow cover that made the peak look like it belonged in a range greater than the Sierra. From above the symmetry of the ridge is eye catching.\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\nAfter researching the route more I learned that it would be a significant winter mountaineering objective, with a climbing rating that would become much harder in winter conditions. I was especially concerned about crossing some of the snow covered slabs, as well as the steepness and slope stability of the final couloir climb to exit the route. These difficulties and the great amount of unknowns for them scared me, but they also attracted me. I worked my way up to the route demands with other winter ascents, found the right climbers to partner up with for the route, and carefully watched for the conditions to become good and safe.&lt;/div&gt;\r\n&lt;div&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&amp;Acirc;&amp;nbsp;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n&lt;h2&gt;\r\n&lt;a name=\"TOC-Friday-March-11\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Friday, March 11&lt;/h2&gt;\r\n&lt;i&gt;Note: Perspectives from others are combined in this report.

Vitaly, Max, and I met Shane (from Redding) in Sacramento after work Thursday night and the four of us drove through Tahoe and down the 395 to the Owens Valley.  \r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"http://maps.google.com/maps?f=d&amp;amp;source=s_d&amp;amp;saddr=Oakland,+ca&amp;amp;daddr=38.87423,-120.00554+to:36.7336001,-118.2609237+to:Unknown+road&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;geocode=FUzZQAIddkq2-CkD7aooi32FgDFnk3U11RW0cQ%3BFXYsUQIdXNzY-Ckl4OS0cY6ZgDE0EslYPJGmBw%3BFaCCMAIdRXvz-Ckjw2viBJW_gDGx47Sbc4ef6g%3BFdY5LwId2t7z-A&amp;amp;mra=dpe&amp;amp;mrsp=1&amp;amp;sz=7&amp;amp;via=1,2&amp;amp;sll=37.68382,-119.135742&amp;amp;sspn=5.042175,9.876709&amp;amp;ie=UTF8&amp;amp;ll=36.649691,-118.23555&amp;amp;spn=0.319519,0.617294&amp;amp;t=h&amp;amp;z=11\"&gt;&lt;b&gt;(Winter Driving Route from the Bay Area)&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;i&gt;(keep in mind this doesn\'t factor in Bay Area &amp;amp; Sacramento traffic, Tahoe ski traffic, or how much the winding roads force one to slow down)&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;div align=\"center\"&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;&lt;div class=\"sites-embed-align-center-wrapping-off\"&gt;&lt;div class=\"sites-embed-border-off sites-embed\" style=\"width:800px;\"&gt;&lt;div class=\"sites-embed-content sites-embed-type-ggs-gadget\"&gt;&lt;iframe title=\"Include gadget (iframe)\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" id=\"1966669000\" name=\"1966669000\" allowtransparency=\"true\" class=\"igm\" src=\"//mj89sp3sau2k7lj1eg3k40hkeppguj6j-a-sites-opensocial.googleusercontent.com/gadgets/ifr?url=http://www.gstatic.com/sites-gadgets/iframe/iframe.xml&amp;amp;container=enterprise&amp;amp;view=default&amp;amp;lang=en&amp;amp;country=ALL&amp;amp;sanitize=0&amp;amp;v=1cbf636963b6b8f8&amp;amp;libs=core&amp;amp;mid=199&amp;amp;parent=http://www.markpthomas.com/mountaineering/trip-reports/california/2011-03-13-carlheller#up_scroll=auto&amp;amp;up_iframeURL=http://player.vimeo.com/video/21404582?title%3D0%26byline%3D0%26portrait%3D0%26color%3Dff9933&amp;amp;st=e%3DAIHE3cCVKIMdjHrK9R2B1xXD5j5ecusPOQSdD%252FBO16A1y4kKjyi4rmFSRiyIGbSOjDYMFEHKU3VzDpcU%252FAd4HDj3IGqXm1p1yqvRG5XCMm7MSVy%252BAD7sZHpDyMYy%252Bb15FqZZX5QW9wY9%26c%3Denterprise&amp;amp;rpctoken=-8037621841555799265\"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;Driving To The Trail Head&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;/div&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\nFriday we finished the drive and met Kevin on the dirt road approach just outside of Independence.

The creek crossings became much more difficult, and once the snow got deep enough to get out the snowshoes, things got really bad. It is really tricky crossing a thickly wooded creek with deep unconsolidated snow on both sides with snowshoes on while wearing a large, heavy pack. Each crossing became more annoying than the last. At last we began reaching the clearings and we expected to start making better time, but George Creek wasn&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;t done with us yet. Things got really bad when we discovered that the snow cover was just deep enough to cover bushes, deadfall, and talus boulders under a smooth sheen of white, but unconsolidated enough to allow us to punch through the snow to the waist in the many moats waiting for us as booby traps. \r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\nThe snowshoes did nothing to limit the postholing as far as I could tell, except that when one leg went all way in to the crotch, it was actually possible to get back up on the snow surface despite the heavy pack trying to hold you down. Whenever I could find a log, buried or exposed, I tried to walk along it in my snowshoes to stay off of the death snow. All of the postholing in the sun and soft snow got our boots drenched &amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#147; never a good thing to have happen on approach day.\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\nOur pace slowed to a crawl and our morale dropped. Luckily our mood was lifted when Shane punched through one seemingly benign patch of snow and got his snowshoe stuck underneath a hidden log. He struggled and struggled. He began cursing, but this didn&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;t help him in the slightest. He attempted to dig himself out enough to take off his snowshoe, but to no avail. Much laughter and video-taking ensued by the rest of us as Shane threw snowballs in retaliation.\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;table&gt;\r\n&lt;tbody&gt;\r\n&lt;tr&gt;\r\n&lt;td&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;table&gt;\r\n&lt;tbody&gt;\r\n&lt;tr&gt;\r\n&lt;td&gt;\r\n&lt;table&gt;\r\n&lt;tbody&gt;\r\n&lt;tr&gt;\r\n&lt;td&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-J-bWwSuAVyc/Tm-pmXGOlBI/AAAAAAACs-Y/gcP9DOFVO-0/s2000/006-Shane-Taunt-byVitaliy.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-J-bWwSuAVyc/Tm-pmXGOlBI/AAAAAAACs-Y/gcP9DOFVO-0/s400/006-Shane-Taunt-byVitaliy.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;/td&gt;\r\n&lt;/tr&gt;\r\n&lt;tr&gt;\r\n&lt;td&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;&lt;b&gt;Shane mocking George Creek\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;i&gt;Photo by Vitaliy&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;/td&gt;\r\n&lt;/tr&gt;\r\n&lt;/tbody&gt;\r\n&lt;/table&gt;\r\n&lt;/td&gt;\r\n&lt;td&gt;\r\n&lt;table&gt;\r\n&lt;tbody&gt;\r\n&lt;tr&gt;\r\n&lt;td&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-Ch2SijEBdkI/Tm-pltWkevI/AAAAAAACs-g/2j0DYdpQdZ0/s2000/007-Shane-Posthole-byMax.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-Ch2SijEBdkI/Tm-pltWkevI/AAAAAAACs-g/2j0DYdpQdZ0/s400/007-Shane-Posthole-byMax.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;/td&gt;\r\n&lt;/tr&gt;\r\n&lt;tr&gt;\r\n&lt;td&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;&lt;b&gt;George Creek mocking Shane\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;i&gt;Photo by Max&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;/td&gt;\r\n&lt;/tr&gt;\r\n&lt;/tbody&gt;\r\n&lt;/table&gt;\r\n&lt;/td&gt;\r\n&lt;/tr&gt;\r\n&lt;/tbody&gt;\r\n&lt;/table&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;div align=\"center\"&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;div class=\"sites-embed-align-center-wrapping-off\"&gt;&lt;div class=\"sites-embed-border-off sites-embed\" style=\"width:800px;\"&gt;&lt;div class=\"sites-embed-content sites-embed-type-ggs-gadget\"&gt;&lt;iframe title=\"Include gadget (iframe)\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" id=\"1348503846\" name=\"1348503846\" allowtransparency=\"true\" class=\"igm\" src=\"//mj89sp3sau2k7lj1eg3k40hkeppguj6j-a-sites-opensocial.googleusercontent.com/gadgets/ifr?url=http://www.gstatic.com/sites-gadgets/iframe/iframe.xml&amp;amp;container=enterprise&amp;amp;view=default&amp;amp;lang=en&amp;amp;country=ALL&amp;amp;sanitize=0&amp;amp;v=1cbf636963b6b8f8&amp;amp;libs=core&amp;amp;mid=27&amp;amp;parent=http://www.markpthomas.com/mountaineering/trip-reports/california/2011-03-13-carlheller#up_scroll=auto&amp;amp;up_iframeURL=http://player.vimeo.com/video/21334253?title%3D0%26byline%3D0%26portrait%3D0%26color%3Dff0179&amp;amp;st=e%3DAIHE3cCEHOTHC%252F5PffaIMXc4roShO8PwyJ3Zo4iFlf%252Banas4eniUkaDh4gdni1x1QP2By%252Fes6o%252B0vAv%252FtxThFfVYBrl6orDNQQZO5gezUGs1pGCa8U0PM%252Bq5DchYICdqUGSbiY5UoMMS%26c%3Denterprise&amp;amp;rpctoken=8315269519307010859\"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;Mark mocking Shane&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;/div&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;h3&gt;\r\n&lt;a name=\"TOC-Escaping-George-Creek\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Escaping George Creek&lt;/h3&gt;\r\n\r\nAfter some climbing up and down on the side slopes to get around obstacles, the snow got deeper and we started making better time. Still, we had climbed only 1,500 over the first 3 hours and but this time it had taken us over 4 hours to do the first 2.4 miles of George Creek, and we had only ascended about 2,000 ft. We were only halfway to camp by mileage, and we still had 3,000 ft to climb!\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\nFortunately from here on the going was straightforward. I turned on my I-Pod and charged up the hill, taking turns breaking trail with Kevin as we tried to make up for lost time. We really needed to reach our planned campsite so that we&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;d be properly positioned for the climb the next day, and we really needed to get there before sunset to preview the route. Plus, setting up camp and melting water on winter climbs is always easier before the sun goes down. \r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;table&gt;\r\n&lt;tbody&gt;\r\n&lt;tr&gt;\r\n&lt;td&gt;\r\n&lt;table&gt;\r\n&lt;tbody&gt;\r\n&lt;tr&gt;\r\n&lt;td&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-Jpjhf8rJTwM/Tm-psVm0XTI/AAAAAAACSOY/tzlEX3mvVUQ/s2000/008-Vitaliy-2-198309_10150116008412270_515072269_6166576_5869085_n.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-Jpjhf8rJTwM/Tm-psVm0XTI/AAAAAAACSOY/tzlEX3mvVUQ/s200/008-Vitaliy-2-198309_10150116008412270_515072269_6166576_5869085_n.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;/td&gt;\r\n&lt;/tr&gt;\r\n&lt;tr&gt;\r\n&lt;td&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Snowshoeing up through some cool little canyons\r\n(Photo by Vitaliy)&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;/td&gt;\r\n&lt;/tr&gt;\r\n&lt;/tbody&gt;\r\n&lt;/table&gt;\r\n&lt;/td&gt;\r\n&lt;td&gt;\r\n&lt;table&gt;\r\n&lt;tbody&gt;\r\n&lt;tr&gt;\r\n&lt;td&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-EkfaOaKkf3Q/Tm-o9W4o_eI/AAAAAAACSQg/1skN9WzVc9c/s2000/2011-03-11%2520-%252004%2520-%2520Approaching%2520Camp.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-EkfaOaKkf3Q/Tm-o9W4o_eI/AAAAAAACSQg/1skN9WzVc9c/s200/2011-03-11%2520-%252004%2520-%2520Approaching%2520Camp.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;/td&gt;\r\n&lt;/tr&gt;\r\n&lt;tr&gt;\r\n&lt;td&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Ascending below Tunnabora&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;/td&gt;\r\n&lt;/tr&gt;\r\n&lt;/tbody&gt;\r\n&lt;/table&gt;\r\n&lt;/td&gt;\r\n&lt;td&gt;\r\n&lt;table&gt;\r\n&lt;tbody&gt;\r\n&lt;tr&gt;\r\n&lt;td&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-VLXCjcrYDYU/Tm-o95DlX3I/AAAAAAACSQo/yYeAO7uUPL4/s2000/2011-03-11%2520-%252006%2520-%2520Looking%2520down%2520George%2520Creek.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-VLXCjcrYDYU/Tm-o95DlX3I/AAAAAAACSQo/yYeAO7uUPL4/s200/2011-03-11%2520-%252006%2520-%2520Looking%2520down%2520George%2520Creek.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;/td&gt;\r\n&lt;/tr&gt;\r\n&lt;tr&gt;\r\n&lt;td&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Looking back towards Williamson&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;/td&gt;\r\n&lt;/tr&gt;\r\n&lt;/tbody&gt;\r\n&lt;/table&gt;\r\n&lt;/td&gt;\r\n&lt;td&gt;\r\n&lt;table&gt;\r\n&lt;tbody&gt;\r\n&lt;tr&gt;\r\n&lt;td&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-9Wh2tawiGVg/Tm-pBQMlg1I/AAAAAAACSQ0/79x11B0q15k/s2000/2011-03-11%2520-%252008%2520-%2520Water%2520Ice%2520%2526%2520Chutes%2520on%2520N%2520Side%2520of%2520Canyon.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-9Wh2tawiGVg/Tm-pBQMlg1I/AAAAAAACSQ0/79x11B0q15k/s200/2011-03-11%2520-%252008%2520-%2520Water%2520Ice%2520%2526%2520Chutes%2520on%2520N%2520Side%2520of%2520Canyon.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;/td&gt;\r\n&lt;/tr&gt;\r\n&lt;tr&gt;\r\n&lt;td&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Water ice columns!

The &amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#152;mid really only fits 2 people with gear, maybe 3 without, but I had devised an idea for how to fit 5 people and gear with room for 2 stoves inside for winter camping.  Because we arrived late in the day and the snowpack made for harder digging, my crazy architectural masterpiece was only partially realized (we did without the nice interior stairs, holes were shallower w/ less room for stoves), and Kevin had given up on us and just went to sleep in his bivy sack by the stoves.

I had suggested we wake at this time to leave 1 hour before sunrise so that we&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;d reach the beginning of the route just as alpenglow was hitting the peak - I wanted to save every ounce of precious daylight we had for the serious climbing!\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\nI got up but no one else rose. The tent sides were flapping and vibrating like crazy. The wind was really howling outside! This was not good for climbing a route of this commitment, especially in winter. Shane woke up and said he thought it was too windy outside. We agreed to sleep in until 7 and see if the wind died down by then.\r\n\r\n&lt;hr&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;table&gt;\r\n&lt;tbody&gt;\r\n&lt;tr&gt;\r\n&lt;td&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-AKCsRX2gWbE/Tm-pIOGoGtI/AAAAAAAAwqI/OJze3bqicoU/s2000/2011-03-12%2520-%252001%2520-%2520Sunrise%2520on%2520Carl%2520Heller.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-AKCsRX2gWbE/Tm-pIOGoGtI/AAAAAAAAwqI/OJze3bqicoU/s800/2011-03-12%2520-%252001%2520-%2520Sunrise%2520on%2520Carl%2520Heller.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;/td&gt;\r\n&lt;/tr&gt;\r\n&lt;tr&gt;\r\n&lt;td&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Carl Heller awaits&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;/td&gt;\r\n&lt;/tr&gt;\r\n&lt;/tbody&gt;\r\n&lt;/table&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\nWe woke to brighter skies at 7am. The tent was still shaking and vibrating. We began talking about aborting our attempt on the route. Yes, it would have really sucked to do such a difficult approach only to walk out the next day, but none of us wanted to be caught in an exposed bivy on that ridge under high winds. We agreed to abort . . . or maybe, wait a little longer, and at the very least head up to the base of the route ready to climb and make the final decision there. Maybe the winds were just bad at the campsite based on how the flows were draining down the cirque?\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\nAs the others slept in a bit more and began to slowly stir, I went outside to get some morning shots of the peak and route, wanting to at least salvage what I could with our time and effort to get up here by enjoying the pristine winter views. Outside I immediately noticed something interesting &amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#147; the poor job we did of sealing the tent walls to the ground made it a collector for wind and the ultralight fabric accentuated the effects. The shaking of the tent tricked us into thinking the wind was blowing much harder than it was. \r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\nThe wind was sustained at about 0-5mph, with occasional gusts to about 15 mph (my best estimate based on what I&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;ve felt when I&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;ve recorded winds), which was no different than what the forecasts had called for when we left, so why abort now? I announced this good news to the group and we all decided to pack up and head out ASAP while closely monitoring the wind. We&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;d get going like we&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;re going to climb, but we&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;d turn back at the base if the winds seemed worse than forecasted. Although the gusts became more sustained by the time we left at about 8am, they were still no stronger than about 15 mph.\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;h3&gt;\r\n&lt;a name=\"TOC-Go-And-the-Toe-\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Go! And the &amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#152;Toe&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;&lt;/h3&gt;\r\n\r\nWe quickly cramponed up the 800 ft gain to the base of the ridge, enjoying the dramatic views as the ridge unfolded before us. It looks very different from every angle &amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#147; slabby on the north side, sheer on the south side. From those ends the &amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#156;wall-like&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#157; rise is apparent, but from head on it looks more like a direct ar&amp;Atilde;&amp;ordf;te shooting up to the summit. Beware the effects of this foreshortening from perspective or else you&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;re in for a nasty surprise on the ridge! There is twice as much horizontal distance to climb as there is vertical distance &amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#147; about 2,400 ft in all. At the base of the ridge the winds had completely disappeared and we gave &lt;b&gt;Operation Carl Heller&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;s East Ridge&lt;/b&gt; a Go! \r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;table&gt;\r\n&lt;tbody&gt;\r\n&lt;tr&gt;\r\n&lt;td&gt;\r\n&lt;table&gt;\r\n&lt;tbody&gt;\r\n&lt;tr&gt;\r\n&lt;td&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-ic9rwFQW67I/Tm-pJSsjyAI/AAAAAAACSSE/y0UQiVbFG8c/s2000/2011-03-12%2520-%252002%2520-%2520Carl%2520Heller%2520%2526%2520Lake.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-ic9rwFQW67I/Tm-pJSsjyAI/AAAAAAACSSE/y0UQiVbFG8c/s400/2011-03-12%2520-%252002%2520-%2520Carl%2520Heller%2520%2526%2520Lake.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;/td&gt;\r\n&lt;/tr&gt;\r\n&lt;tr&gt;\r\n&lt;td&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Going around the lake&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;/td&gt;\r\n&lt;/tr&gt;\r\n&lt;/tbody&gt;\r\n&lt;/table&gt;\r\n&lt;/td&gt;\r\n&lt;td&gt;\r\n&lt;table&gt;\r\n&lt;tbody&gt;\r\n&lt;tr&gt;\r\n&lt;td&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-6u3KcTUyTvo/Tm-poByGJJI/AAAAAAACSOc/-yrEtcMJ-Fk/s2000/009-Max-3-189120_1667226048748_1480207555_31602218_8291183_n.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-6u3KcTUyTvo/Tm-poByGJJI/AAAAAAACSOc/-yrEtcMJ-Fk/s400/009-Max-3-189120_1667226048748_1480207555_31602218_8291183_n.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;/td&gt;\r\n&lt;/tr&gt;\r\n&lt;tr&gt;\r\n&lt;td&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Vitaliy and Shane getting smaller as the ridge gets larger\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;i&gt;(Photo by Max)&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;/td&gt;\r\n&lt;/tr&gt;\r\n&lt;/tbody&gt;\r\n&lt;/table&gt;\r\n&lt;/td&gt;\r\n&lt;/tr&gt;\r\n&lt;/tbody&gt;\r\n&lt;/table&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\nWe had hoped to do some simul-climbing, but climbing conditions were severe enough that we ended up pitching out about 2,000 ft worth of climbing. Starting the roped climbing at 8:40 turned out to be way too late for a climb of this length in winter! Luckily I told the others what I thought the likelihood of a bivy was, so everyone but Max and I brought bivy sacks. I knew that I could do fine sleeping in my backpack with a down jacket (which I brought) and down pants (which I forgot) and Max, well, I don&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;t know what he did but he sure didn&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;t seem to mind! We also brought a Jetboil this time to melt water to avoid dehydration if we bivied.\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\nThe ridge rose straight up in a triangular-shaped wall which I like to call the &amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#156;Toe&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#157; because it reminds me of the Toe of a glacier as the flat glacier drops suddenly to the bare ground. According to other trip reports, this was one of the class 4 cruxes of the route. Above the Toe the ridge suddenly stops rising and traverses gradually until it reaches what I like to call the &amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#156;Step&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#157;, where a section near the crest of the ridge suddenly juts up vertically from the rest of the ridge above a vertical step. After surmounting the step the angle would ease again until we reached the final snow chute. The final hundred feet or so before the chute was supposed to be the crux of the route, where a gendarme forced parties off of the ridge crest and onto extremely exposed slabs on the north side. Apparently a piton could be found on this section. (I had hoped after looking at photos that we could just climb slightly harder rock and stay on the gendarme fin and avoid the steep snow covered slab crux, but I had misjudged the scale from photos and this turned out not to be practical.) We expected to have a quick and straightforward snowclimb of a few hundred feet up the couloir to the notch near the summit and from there, 1-2 more pitches of climbing or a few hundred feet of scrambling to the summit.\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;table&gt;\r\n&lt;tbody&gt;\r\n&lt;tr&gt;\r\n&lt;td&gt;\r\n&lt;table&gt;\r\n&lt;tbody&gt;\r\n&lt;tr&gt;\r\n&lt;td&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-lJE1btlMUDE/Tm-pJ6n08cI/AAAAAAACs-o/Al7_VPA4nzU/s2000/2011-03-12%2520-%252003%2520-%2520Carl%2520Heller%2520East%2520Ridge%2520-%2520Annotate.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-lJE1btlMUDE/Tm-pJ6n08cI/AAAAAAACs-o/Al7_VPA4nzU/s400/2011-03-12%2520-%252003%2520-%2520Carl%2520Heller%2520East%2520Ridge%2520-%2520Annotate.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;/td&gt;\r\n&lt;/tr&gt;\r\n&lt;tr&gt;\r\n&lt;td&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Route Topo (numbers need adjustment.

It is maybe easy 4th class but more comparable to sustained 3rd class in my opinion &amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#147; it gets steep, but the climbing stays solid and juggy and none of the moves are any more technical than a basic hand jam here and there. I placed one piece for the pitch as I ascended a corner that cut diagonally across the face. Near the top I avoided a crux by stepping right into an easier crack and then left again, then surmounted an easy final step to a snow-filled chute at the top. This section required a bit of finesse in boots as the snow was thinly covering some slab on the left side &amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#147; a good warm up for things to come.

The climbing here was mostly 2nd-3rd class, but with the snow and exposure we were glad to have a rope.

of rocks that I recognized from photos &amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#147; a short wall barring progress that cut down along the slab as it dropped off to the north. This wall was crossed by ascending the third crack/chimney that cut through it. It was hard to tell from the pictures how hard it was, but it did look funky. What really concerned me was that this was the first of two sections where from summer photos I knew that there was a relatively featureless slab beneath the snow. The snow was pretty shallow here, so I was worried about slipping off the rock, or causing the snow to slide off. The ridge crest was too narrow, steep, and rounded with snow too close to it to ascend by &amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#152;a cheval&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153; or liebacking.\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;table&gt;\r\n&lt;tbody&gt;\r\n&lt;tr&gt;\r\n&lt;td&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;table&gt;\r\n&lt;tbody&gt;\r\n&lt;tr&gt;\r\n&lt;td&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://www.snwburd.com/bob/trip_photos/carl_heller_1/DSC05564_w.html\"&gt;&lt;img height=\"300\" src=\"http://www.snwburd.com/bob/trip_photos/carl_heller_1/reg/DSC05564.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;/td&gt;\r\n&lt;/tr&gt;\r\n&lt;tr&gt;\r\n&lt;td&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;The slab &amp;amp; chimney section in summer.\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;i&gt;(Photo by Bob Burd)&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;/td&gt;\r\n&lt;/tr&gt;\r\n&lt;/tbody&gt;\r\n&lt;/table&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;/td&gt;\r\n&lt;td&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;table&gt;\r\n&lt;tbody&gt;\r\n&lt;tr&gt;\r\n&lt;td&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-0fn6dq0AIsg/Tm-pSFQP3LI/AAAAAAACSTA/nCqPcBc1oN4/s2000/2011-03-12%2520-%252013%2520-%2520Pitch%25206%2520Slab%2520%2526%2520Chimney.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-0fn6dq0AIsg/Tm-pSFQP3LI/AAAAAAACSTA/nCqPcBc1oN4/s400/2011-03-12%2520-%252013%2520-%2520Pitch%25206%2520Slab%2520%2526%2520Chimney.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;/td&gt;\r\n&lt;/tr&gt;\r\n&lt;tr&gt;\r\n&lt;td&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;This doesn\'t look too secure to me&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;/td&gt;\r\n&lt;/tr&gt;\r\n&lt;/tbody&gt;\r\n&lt;/table&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;/td&gt;\r\n&lt;/tr&gt;\r\n&lt;/tbody&gt;\r\n&lt;/table&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\nI wavered here.

I decided to wait for Kevin to reach us, after which I briefed him about the section.

Since I was not having much luck finding a partner for one of the objectives I was really burning to do, I had resigned myself to stay in town.

Since he lives in LA and spends most of the year out of the country guiding and teaching for an outdoor group called The Dragons, I have rarely had a chance to climb with him, so I jumped at the opportunity. Japhy was fully on board for climbing the classic Direct Southeast Face of Clyde Minaret (IV, 5.9+, 12P), so before I knew it, I had a car rented, time off from work confirmed, and was hurtling across Tioga pass on a bright, moonlit Friday night to meet him in Mammoth.\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"http://lh5.ggpht.com/-mtb6fb049Gw/T9DnRJzgyQI/AAAAAAABH6U/23hBbQaBm64/s2000/2012-06-02%252520-%25252003%252520-%252520Minarets%252520Far%252520-%252520annotated.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"http://lh5.ggpht.com/-mtb6fb049Gw/T9DnRJzgyQI/AAAAAAABH6U/23hBbQaBm64/s640/2012-06-02%252520-%25252003%252520-%252520Minarets%252520Far%252520-%252520annotated.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Minarets.

Downclimbing, we made it to the snow just as it got dark. The temperature plummeted and the wind picked up, but we stayed nice and comfy in the puffies that we had painstaking hauled up the route. A full moon added to the nice ambiance as we picked our way around Ken Minaret and scrambled up to the wrong descent notch (doh!).\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\nA brief look at the map showed we were close and a bit more scrambling took us to a reasonable notch with a rappel anchor, an old fixed line and very loose rock at the top. After this last obstacle we had clear sailing down to camp, where we enjoyed the views of Clyde Minaret illuminated by a full moon a we ate dinner. It had been a full and grand day in the Minarets!\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;hr&gt;\r\n&lt;hr&gt;\r\n&lt;h2&gt;\r\n&lt;a name=\"TOC-Monday-June-4\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Monday, June 4&lt;/h2&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;Lucky Times&lt;/b&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\nWe slept in and took our time heading out. Japhy and I had hoped to spend another day in the Minarets and climb Michael Minaret, or maybe a route on Banner Peak, but the weather had forecast a 40% chance of precipitation on Monday with a large drop in temperature.\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\nJaphy did not like the idea of slogging back up to Deadman Pass and had talked me into hiking down to Devil\'s Postpile and back up the road. We could take a trail that cut the switchback in the road. And who knows? Maybe we could bum a ride? Even if we got in trouble being on the road, we had not entered from that side, so we figured at most we\'d be shooed into the forest or allowed to walk out since we had technically not reached the road unlawfully.\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\nWe enjoyed the clear, sunny morning, but by the time we left camp the winds had picked up and clouds had gathered around the Minarets. It was a shame they hid Clyde, as I was hoping to scope out the views of Clyde above Minaret Lake for some nigh photography ideas on my next visit.\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"http://lh6.ggpht.com/-TwBo0DzRCls/T8940uj4y-I/AAAAAAABH18/SnsSy-Lacks/s2000/2012-06-04%252520-%25252003%252520-%252520Minarets%252520in%252520the%252520clouds%252520from%252520Minaret%252520Lake.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"http://lh6.ggpht.com/-TwBo0DzRCls/T8940uj4y-I/AAAAAAABH18/SnsSy-Lacks/s640/2012-06-04%252520-%25252003%252520-%252520Minarets%252520in%252520the%252520clouds%252520from%252520Minaret%252520Lake.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Minarets in the morning clouds above Minaret Lake as we departed.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n \r\n\r\nDeeper down in the forest we ran into a couple of hikers passing through on the John Muir trail - the only people we saw the three days we were back there. As we reached the last 2 miles of trail, large trees were blown down everywhere, forcing us to do a lot of climbing over and detouring around trees.

We had barely walked 10 minutes when a fuel truck started up from the end of the road. The driver had just made his annual delivery and was driving out. As the truck approached us, Japhy, ever the sweet talker, waved to the trucker, and got us a ride out! As we drove up the road, we could see that the steep, loose hillside and the vast number of huge trees blown over would have made it an epic hiking out on our intended trail. Just as we were let off at the Minaret summit, the rain started pouring and quickly changed to a mixture of rain and hail. Talk about perfect timing! We definitely would have gotten caught in that weather had we not gotten that ride, but instead, we were enjoying beer &amp;amp; burgers in Mammoth as we watched the deluge, and then caught refuge for the evening at the Mammoth hot springs.\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"http://lh4.ggpht.com/-x1CQOMMWBZE/T895EckHrCI/AAAAAAABH3E/70LbexHIYQQ/s2000/2012-06-04%252520-%25252020a%252520-%252520Storming%252520clouds%252520from%252520the%252520hot%252520springs%252520Banner.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"http://lh4.ggpht.com/-x1CQOMMWBZE/T895EckHrCI/AAAAAAABH3E/70LbexHIYQQ/s640/2012-06-04%252520-%25252020a%252520-%252520Storming%252520clouds%252520from%252520the%252520hot%252520springs%252520Banner.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Stormy clouds over the Sierra, seen from the hot springs.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"http://lh4.ggpht.com/-kr-VeXBsMT0/T895Gn7C0KI/AAAAAAABH3M/0JbIBfvwyQo/s2000/2012-06-05%252520-%25252001a%252520-%252520Laurel%252520Mtn%252520from%252520the%252520hot%252520springs.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"http://lh4.ggpht.com/-kr-VeXBsMT0/T895Gn7C0KI/AAAAAAABH3M/0JbIBfvwyQo/s640/2012-06-05%252520-%25252001a%252520-%252520Laurel%252520Mtn%252520from%252520the%252520hot%252520springs.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Laurel Mtn NE Gully (III, 5.2)&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"http://lh5.ggpht.com/-RCuAIqgs45Q/T895G3mSNGI/AAAAAAABH3Q/SmSA06on36Y/s2000/2012-06-05%252520-%25252002%252520-%252520Sawtooth%252520Range%252520from%252520Bridgeport.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"http://lh5.ggpht.com/-RCuAIqgs45Q/T895G3mSNGI/AAAAAAABH3Q/SmSA06on36Y/s640/2012-06-05%252520-%25252002%252520-%252520Sawtooth%252520Range%252520from%252520Bridgeport.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Sawtooth Range under a fresh dumping of snow.

We only placed nuts for the anchor to save cams, and even there we mostly used pink, red and black tricams instead. We found having extras in small cams including the narrower and smaller C3s down do a #0 to be very helpful, especially for the first two pitches. If you are solid on 5.8 leading and climbing with a 60m rope, you could get by with closer to a single set of cams, since our rack worked well for 70m pitches.\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\nAccording to Roper &amp;amp; Steck\'s \"50 Classic Climbs of North America\":\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;\"Although the climb is usually done clean, it is advisable to carry five pitons in addition to a standard selection of twenty chocks\"&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\nThis is no longer advisable. ;-)\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;hr&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;Descent:&lt;/b&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\nFrom the summit, unrope and scramble north. About 200 ft later you will encounter a steep step (cl. 4). This is the crux of the Rock Route (IMHO one of the best cl. 4 scrambles in the Sierra) and here you have two options:\r\n\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\n1. Continue on to downclimb the Rock Route. This is similar in nature and length to the East Face of Middle Palisade, but a bit harder and more exposed, so only do this if you have time and energy for lots of sustained downclimbing!\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\n2. Turn left and switchback on some exposed but solid ledges to reach a rappel anchor. A single rope rappel trending climber\'s left brings you into a chute. From here cross the chute to a rib and downclimb the ridge about 100 ft to find our pimpin\' rapp station. One more single rope rappel (or possibly some downclimbing) places you into a good chute for downclimbing. Basically, a single 60m rope and some downclimbing should easily get you down. From there, downclimb to Amphitheater Lake and traverse around Ken Minaret to South Notch where one more short rappel places you onto easy snow slopes for the remainder of the walk back to Cecile Lake.\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\nThe descent takes a while and would not be fun in the dark, especially if you haven\'t done it before, as it is exposed and would be hard to make sense of by headlamp. So make sure you aim to finish the route with at least enough daylight to get through the first two rappels. Otherwise you are in for an epic night descent or a likely summit bivy.\r\n\r\n&lt;hr&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;Bailing:&lt;/b&gt;\r\nThe route has a number of fixed pieces and bail gear everywhere. Nearly every pitch had some rappel setup, so with two ropes you can rappel the route, although be prepared to make some new rapp stations or leave a bit of gear.\r\n\r\n&lt;hr&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;Route Topo:&lt;/b&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\nI brought copies of three different topos and have this to say:\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\n1. The topo on Mtn Project was utter junk. We rarely were on anything like that topo.\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\n2. The topo from Moynier &amp;amp; Fiddler is pretty good, but a little vague and misleading at some critical junctions.\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\n3. We had no trouble finding our way following the route description on SummitPost and using Peter Croft\'s topo in \"The Good, the Great, and the Awesome\". Bring these along!\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;hr&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;Miscellany:&lt;/b&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\nFor the most part, all of the pitches were very long and sustained, though there were many rest along the way. We only were able to link some pitches with a minumum of simul-climbing and not too much drag because we climbed with 70m doubles, so we trimmed the route to 10 pitches and could have trimmed it to 9 if I had set up the belay before the 5.8 traverse at a better spot to reduce drag. Be prepared to do the route as 12 pitches if you bring a 60m or a single rope!\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\nAlso, the route is long and fairly sustained, and some of the moves higher up are arguably as hard as any on the direct start. So if you think you climb hard and fast enough to do the route, you certainly can handle the 5.9+ start and absolutely should do it this way for two of the best pitches on the route! I have heard this route (without the direct start) described as a good 5.8 route for the solid 5.9 leader, and I\'d agree.\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\nThe route sucks up gear, and nearly all of the moves can be well protected. \r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\nThe face looks butt ugly and dirty in the shade, but in the sun it looks glorious. Apart from the occasional friable rock and some loose bits on the ledges in the middle pitches, the rock was very solid. The route was far cleaner and more solid than any of the aretes Temple Crag, at least!\r\n\r\n&lt;hr&gt;\r\n&lt;hr&gt;\r\n&lt;h2&gt;\r\n&lt;a name=\"TOC-Links\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Links&lt;/h2&gt;\r\n&lt;ul&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://picasaweb.google.com/105894936663116565516/20120602to04SEFaceOfClydeMinaretWJaphyDIV5912P?authuser=0&amp;amp;feat=directlink\"&gt;Picasa Album&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://picasaweb.google.com/105894936663116565516/20120602to04SEFaceOfClydeMinaretWJaphyDIV5912P?authuser=0&amp;amp;feat=directlink\"&gt;SuperTopo TR&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;/ul&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;/div&gt; \r\n'),(68,38,'/mountaineering/trip-reports/california/mark-n-dirk-s-bivouac-trilogy---part-1-mt-conness','Mt Conness (W Ridge)','Mark N&acirc;Â€Â™ Dirk&acirc;Â€Â™s Bivouac Trilogy - Part 1: Mt Conness','Trip_Report','content: &lt;div dir=\"ltr\"&gt;\r\n&lt;h1&gt;\r\n&lt;a name=\"TOC-Mark-N-Dirk-s-Bivouac-Trilogy---Part-1:-Mt-Conness\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Mark N&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153; Dirk&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;s Bivouac Trilogy - Part 1: Mt Conness&lt;/h1&gt;\r\n&lt;h2&gt;\r\n&lt;a name=\"TOC-Aug-15-17-2003\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Aug 15-17, 2003&lt;/h2&gt;\r\n&lt;hr&gt;\r\n&lt;hr&gt;\r\n&lt;table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"2\" cellspacing=\"1\"&gt;\r\n&lt;tbody&gt;\r\n&lt;tr&gt;\r\n&lt;td width=\"40%\"&gt;\r\n&lt;font color=\"gray\"&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;b&gt;Stats&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/font&gt;\r\n&lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;Route:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href=\"http://www.summitpost.org/show/route_link.pl/route_id/258/object_id/335\"&gt;East Ridge&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"http://www.summitpost.org/show/route_link.pl/route_id/243/object_id/335\"&gt;West Ridge&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;Elevation Gained:&lt;/b&gt; 4,200 ft  &lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;RT Distance:&lt;/b&gt; TBD  &lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;RT Time:&lt;/b&gt; 24 hrs  &lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;Trailhead:&lt;/b&gt; Sawmill Capmground  &lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;TH Elevation:&lt;/b&gt; 9,800&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;  &lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;Summit Elev.:&lt;/b&gt; 12,590&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;  &lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;Rating:&lt;/b&gt; IV, 5.6  &lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;Climbers:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href=\"http://www.summitpost.org/mountains/user_link.pl?user_id=13451\"&gt;Mark Thomas&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"http://www.summitpost.org/mountains/user_link.pl/user_id/583\"&gt;Dirk Summers&lt;/a&gt;, Vito, Gus  &lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;/ul&gt;\r\n&lt;/td&gt;\r\n&lt;td&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-IRunymAf3wk/Tg7RNhXT5BI/AAAAAAAAPK8/ltMBLO7_jDI/s2000/MtConness-East%2520Ridge9.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img height=\"200\" src=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-IRunymAf3wk/Tg7RNhXT5BI/AAAAAAAAPK8/ltMBLO7_jDI/s800/MtConness-East%2520Ridge9.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;/td&gt;\r\n&lt;/tr&gt;\r\n&lt;/tbody&gt;\r\n&lt;/table&gt;\r\n&lt;hr&gt;\r\n&lt;hr&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;It was raining hard, and the cold breeze made it hard to fall asleep as I collapsed onto the rock-hard ground. Luckily I had a scrap of cardboard to use as padding, so I was at least a little comfortable and didn&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;t lose as much body heat to the ground from conduction. Besides reeking of BO from several days of being unable to shower, I was a little malnourished and extremely sleep deprived, having only gotten a few brief hours of sleep over the last few days, and sometimes it was hard to tell if I was awake or asleep as I was in a continuous dream-state. I wasn&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;t the only one sorely in need of rest, and as I nursed my callused hands there was a yelp as someone near me gushed blood &amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#147; apparently they had an accident with their exacto knife.    &lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;No, I wasn&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;t on some thrilling climb in the Sierras, although sometimes fantasizing about this made the nights easier. I was working my way through a summer architecture studio at UC Berkeley during the summer of 2003. I had joined Summitpost a few months earlier after Bob Burd had referred me to it over the previous winter as I was searching online for information about climbing Round Top.  Since then the site had mainly been an interesting curiosity for me, as well as a very useful resource for planning climbs.      &lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Then, one dreary night in Wurster Hall I got a mysterious e-mail from Dirk Summers. Who? I had no idea who this person was, but apparently he was a Summitpost member interested in climbing Mt Sill, one of the CA 14ers that I wanted to climb.  Great!  I had been having much better luck finding partners for my mountain adventures at Berkeley than I ever did in Utah, and this new possible partner was just what I needed since I had really wanted to begin climbing some technical alpine routes.  Up to this point I had only done crag climbing and all of my mountaineering consisted of class 3-4 scrambles. SummitPost had become more than just a reference for me, and from this point on it became an integral part of my climbing trips.    &lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Before climbing Mt Sill, Dirk wanted to do an easier climb with me over the summer so that we could get a better feel for each other. I couldn&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;t get enough time off from studio to take weekends off, so I missed out on a trip to Bear Creek Spire.  Finally my studio ended and Dirk suggested I join him on an easier climb near Yosemite with an American Alpine Club group. I still had never met this guy, but from the types of climbs he suggested and what insight I could glean from his SP profile, I felt like I would do fine seconding on a climb and that Dirk was well qualified to do a safe job leading. Little did I realize that the dynamics between Dirk &amp;amp; me would lead consistently to unplanned high-altitude bivouacs (well,  for the contiguous 48 states), of which this would be  the first.    \r\n\r\n\r\n&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;h2&gt;\r\n&lt;a name=\"TOC-August-15th:-Strange-Companions\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;August 15th: Strange Companions&lt;/h2&gt;\r\n\r\nDirk already had arrangements to carpool with another group, so I would be meeting him at a campground just outside of Lee Vining. I was able to arrange a ride with two other members of this AAC outing, Paul and his lady friend.  Paul turned out to be a very interesting character as he had a striking resemblance to Steve Buscemi - &amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#152;kinda funny lookin&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153; - and he was rather small. Sadly his car wasn&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;t much larger, and fitting in was a squeeze.      \r\n\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;Next we spent nearly an hour picking up our second passenger (I can&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;t remember her name). Every inch of the inside of her Berkeley apartment was covered with random colorful knickknacks - I could have sworn that she was a gypsy.  This lady had more stuff to bring than Paul and me combined, and every time we thought that we were about ready to leave she remembered something else that we needed to shove into the trunk and back seat. Near the end, Paul was beginning to get peeved, which made the situation all the more amusing. To top it all off, because she had been having some back problems, we lined the back seat of the car with pillows so that she could lie down for the drive.    \r\n&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Needless to say, when I arrived at the campground and met Dirk, he wasn&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;t nearly as strange as my car companions, which was quite a relief.    &lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;h2&gt;\r\n&lt;a name=\"TOC-August-16th:-The-Approach\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;August 16th: The Approach&lt;/h2&gt;\r\n\r\nIt was a clear sunny morning as Dirk and I left the trailhead with two other members of the American Alpine Club. It was 9am, but the air was still cool as we hiked briskly through the Sawmill Campground and clusters of meadow beyond. Dirk and I would be climbing the West Ridge of Mt Conness, which required that we practically climb the goddamn thing via the East Ridge before losing 1,800 ft to reach the &lt;i&gt;START&lt;/i&gt; of the route.  Dirk had had a number of ideas for what to climb on this trip, and we decided on this climb at the last minute, although I didn&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;t really have any idea what it was like apart from the 5.6 rating. Along for the approach were Vito and Gus. Gus was an old guy, but still spry and full of energy. Vito was much younger and very fit. Together they were going to pick their way up the western slopes of Mt Conness via some class 4 chutes.&amp;Acirc;&amp;nbsp;\r\n   \r\n\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-VhYcYV-L5wI/Tg7Rv3JC3gI/AAAAAAAAPNc/nV33urwpyLo/s2000/MtConness-Approach1.jpg\" style=\"text-align:-webkit-center\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-VhYcYV-L5wI/Tg7Rv3JC3gI/AAAAAAAAPNc/nV33urwpyLo/s500/MtConness-Approach1.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;The first series of ledges to be climbed before gaining the East Ridge route.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Soon the nice trail ended and we began an easy cross-country hike towards the east buttress, a maze of granite walls that appear 5th class from a distance. We planned on climbing through this wall to gain a hanging valley above as a shorter alternative to climbing Mt Conness via Alpine Lake. As it turned out, the buttress was an easily navigable class three scramble over a mixture of granite ledges, with a stream and patches of grass marking the way through.    &lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;table border=\"0\" width=\"200\"&gt;\r\n&lt;tbody&gt;\r\n&lt;tr&gt;\r\n&lt;td&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-i5xXmhD74cA/Tg7Rn6uUuNI/AAAAAAAAPM4/yB8QiiiWY8w/s2000/MtConness-Approach5.jpg\" style=\"text-align:-webkit-center\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"\" src=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-i5xXmhD74cA/Tg7Rn6uUuNI/AAAAAAAAPM4/yB8QiiiWY8w/s400/MtConness-Approach5.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;The East Ridge as seen from the hanging meadow.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;/td&gt;\r\n&lt;td&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/--nHLI6iCHm8/Tg7Rp4NfBPI/AAAAAAAAPNA/Jpmg_Z8kk6U/s2000/MtConness-Approach4.jpg\" style=\"text-align:-webkit-center\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"\" src=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/--nHLI6iCHm8/Tg7Rp4NfBPI/AAAAAAAAPNA/Jpmg_Z8kk6U/s400/MtConness-Approach4.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;A view of the east ridge of Mt Conness (upper right) as seen from the hanging meadow.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;/td&gt;\r\n&lt;/tr&gt;\r\n&lt;/tbody&gt;\r\n&lt;/table&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;After a brief break refilling water and messing around on some boulders in the unnamed lake above the buttress, we continued up the bare, empty valley. We reached the east ridge just as another party was topping out from a technical climb coming up from the glacier, which I thought was surprising. Growing up in Utah, I still hadn&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;t gotten used to the hordes of climbers encountered in the California backcountry. I was awestruck at the view we had of Conness&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;s impressive NE face and the large glacier filling the valley below. Seeing the mountain from this vantage point had me wondering what to expect on the other side!    &lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Soon the scenic ridge ended and we grunted through some sandy class 2 scrambling before reaching the large plateau above. From there I was surprised to see how CLOSE we actually were to Conness&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;s summit for the approach. I suggested that we run over and bag the peak now, to get two summits in for the day, but the others were not as enthusiastic about the idea.    &lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;table border=\"0\" width=\"200\"&gt;\r\n&lt;tbody&gt;\r\n&lt;tr&gt;\r\n&lt;td&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-FTtw8oP0vMo/Tg7RlyTCDPI/AAAAAAAAPMw/uHSjhswUYOg/s2000/MtConness-Approach6.jpg\" style=\"text-align:-webkit-center\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"\" src=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-FTtw8oP0vMo/Tg7RlyTCDPI/AAAAAAAAPMw/uHSjhswUYOg/s400/MtConness-Approach6.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;The summit plateau.

We matched up some snowfields with a route description and headed straight across the open terrain. Along the way Dirk and I admired the impressive views of Mt Maclure and Mt Lyell.  Even from far away they appeared massive, and the large snowfields and glaciers below made them appear to be floating above the clouds.    &lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-Z367uYv8y2M/Tg7RGBvEGDI/AAAAAAAAPKM/MxcCH2lFsAY/s2000/MtConness-WestRidge1.jpg\" style=\"text-align:-webkit-center\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-Z367uYv8y2M/Tg7RGBvEGDI/AAAAAAAAPKM/MxcCH2lFsAY/s500/MtConness-WestRidge1.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;The entire West Ridge of Mt Conness, as viewed from the west edge of the summit plateau.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Finally we were at the chute. It was really steep, but we could pick out a way down. From here we were treated with our first views of the massive West Ridge of Mt Conness &amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#147; a vertical wall of granite over 1,000 feet high sweeping from the bottle-neck that connects to the peak to our plateau all the way down to Roosevelt Lake. I had been climbing in the Sierra for a little less than a year now, but I still wasn&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;t used to such &lt;i&gt;HUGE&lt;/i&gt; cliffs!    &lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-oXjGof36lBk/Tg7RgEMch9I/AAAAAAAAPMU/9OFVzLCiiZc/s2000/MtConness-Approach9.jpg\" style=\"text-align:-webkit-center\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-oXjGof36lBk/Tg7RgEMch9I/AAAAAAAAPMU/9OFVzLCiiZc/s500/MtConness-Approach9.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Looking back up the class 3 chute that we downclimbed to gain the west ridge.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;The chute was steep and full of crappy loose rock and sand, but the route finding was fairly straightforward, and after a little class 4 scrambling we had made it down to an open rocky bowl. The talus was rather small, so cross-country travel at this point was relatively easy, but still slow. As we neared the base of the climb, Dirk and I bid our friends farewell and began traversing to the base of the West Ridge.   &lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;table border=\"0\" width=\"200\"&gt;\r\n&lt;tbody&gt;\r\n&lt;tr&gt;\r\n&lt;td&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-cVVzvOYFnuc/UHotoKW9vGI/AAAAAAABZL8/eVggZhg9wLY/s2000/Dirk-MtConness-WestRidge5.jpg\" style=\"text-align:-webkit-center\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"\" src=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-cVVzvOYFnuc/UHotoKW9vGI/AAAAAAABZL8/eVggZhg9wLY/s400/Dirk-MtConness-WestRidge5.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Mt.

To avoid the danger of running short of rope before reaching the first belay ledge, we decided to climb partway up the route before setting up a belay. In retrospect this was a mistake &amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#147; we climbed too high and soon we were in an awkward position of standing on some narrow ledges in the middle of some low 5th class climbing, and we needed to rope up.\r\n&lt;div&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&amp;Acirc;&amp;nbsp;  \r\n\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-Z9zaAXDKmSg/Tg7Q33fCO7I/AAAAAAAAPJM/Go4UzTG3S9M/s2000/MtConness-WestRidgeRoute2.jpg\" style=\"text-align:-webkit-center\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-Z9zaAXDKmSg/Tg7Q33fCO7I/AAAAAAAAPJM/Go4UzTG3S9M/s500/MtConness-WestRidgeRoute2.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Looking down the West Ridge of Mt Conness just before the sun set.&amp;Acirc;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Oops! Well, we spent the next half hour or so at our precarious perches trying to change out of hiking boots and into rock shoes, put on our harnesses, and get the rope and pro ready to go.  By the time I was anchored and Dirk was climbing it was nearly 4:00.  The approach had been longer than expected, and our delicate gear-changing act had cost us a lot of time. Still, we had high hopes, since the most difficult part of the route was the first few pitches. After that it was smooth sailing on class 4 terrain to the summit.    &lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;table border=\"0\" width=\"200\"&gt;\r\n&lt;tbody&gt;\r\n&lt;tr&gt;\r\n&lt;td&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-8NRaIaWKV2M/Tg7Q7jI9Q4I/AAAAAAAAPJc/mifNhecTgd8/s2000/MtConness-WestRidge4.jpg\" style=\"text-align:-webkit-center\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"\" src=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-8NRaIaWKV2M/Tg7Q7jI9Q4I/AAAAAAAAPJc/mifNhecTgd8/s400/MtConness-WestRidge4.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Looking down the first roped pitch on the West Ridge of Mt Conness.&amp;Acirc;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;/td&gt;\r\n&lt;td&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-ykp3boyOQJk/UHotpiwyF1I/AAAAAAABZMU/HMnbYcuCjCo/s2000/Dirk-MtConness-WestRidge3.jpg\" style=\"text-align:-webkit-center\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"\" src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-ykp3boyOQJk/UHotpiwyF1I/AAAAAAABZMU/HMnbYcuCjCo/s400/Dirk-MtConness-WestRidge3.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Mt.

I headed up some steep sloping ledges that cut away from me at an angle. The many sloped parallel cracks provided some fun jamming and liebacking opportunities while I relied on smearing for my feet. The rock was a little loose in places, but still great! After an awkward ascending traverse, I was at the first belay ledge, with an awesome view of the valley below. I tied in and Dirk took off on the next pitch.    &lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;As I belayed Dirk I noticed a lone figure boulder-hopping far below - they were making really good time! Apparently this person was a lady park ranger who had headed out for an afternoon stroll. After running up to Conness\'s West Ridge, she went on to free-solo the route beginning a little further north than us. Dirk was a little irritated at her cocky attitude as she passed him on this pitch, and I got a good laugh hearing about their encounter once I met up with Dirk at the next belay station.    &lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;The first pitch was the hardest, and the climbing got easier as we climbed higher. We topped out from the headwall just as the sun was setting. From there we could see just how much of the ridge we had left to climb &amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#147; there was no way that we were going to finish before sunset!  While the terrain was low 5th to 4th class, it was still very long. We were momentarily distracted from our predicament as we admired the beauty of the route. On the right the rock dropped away vertically for hundreds of feet, and the dropoff increased as the ridge climbed higher. On the left was a steep chute, merging into the ridge like a breaking wave, ready to spill over the abyss to our right. As we climbed along the razor-sharp arete, the fiery-orange light of the sunset illuminated the ridge. The white granite was a perfect tabula rasa for capturing the color of the sun&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;s rays, and, Chameleon-like, Mt Conness changed hues as we hurried along the ridge, racing the setting sun.  Then it was dark.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;table border=\"0\" width=\"200\"&gt;\r\n&lt;tbody&gt;\r\n&lt;tr&gt;\r\n&lt;td&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-8tTD1SkVbBk/UHotogjtbSI/AAAAAAABZME/98wD7MkJz5Q/s2000/Dirk-MtConness-WestRidge.jpg\" style=\"text-align:-webkit-center\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"\" src=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-8tTD1SkVbBk/UHotogjtbSI/AAAAAAABZME/98wD7MkJz5Q/s400/Dirk-MtConness-WestRidge.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Two of Mt.

I had thought that this would be a climb easily completed in a day, and due to inexperience, I only had jeans and a t-shirt to wear. No warm layers or a windbreaker, and this exposed ridge was windy! Since the climbing wasn&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;t very hard, and we both had headlamps, we decided to just keep climbing in order to stay warm, and hopefully, finish the route and descend.    \r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;Darkness was a two-fold handicap. First of course, was the obvious problem that climbing by headlamp is more difficult, and hence, the route finding slower. Another problem was that by climbing in the dark, it seemed too dangerous to free-climb the class 4. I myself certainly wasn&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;t ready to try something like that, so we ended up belaying the entire 1,800 ft route.    &lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Climbing on the ridge by headlamp was a surreal experience. Although there was a full moon out, Mt Conness blocked our route from its illumination. As a result, we could see the valley below quite clearly. In fact, at one of our belay stations we could actually pick out Half Dome! In the distance we could see the sparkling lights of Oakdale, and Roosevelt Lake shimmered below, yet we were in total darkness. While we could see the landscape around us just fine, when it came to our route, our worldview was limited to whatever the headlamp illuminated. Climbing became a much more enclosed experience, each of us seemingly alone except for when shouting commands.  At one point there were some headlamps down in the valley. They kept flashing, on and off. Were they hikers trying to signal us? Obviously, if we could see their lights in the valley, they could see our lights on the mountain. We couldn&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;t decipher what, if anything, the people were saying, so we climbed on, and eventually the blinking ceased.  A while later the air was filled with the echoing sound of coyotes howling. Still, we climbed on in our little bubbles of light high on the mountain.    &lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;It seemed cruel that as the full moon came out, Mt Conness kept us in the dark, but the mountain wasn&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;t through with me yet. At one point I reached a belay that was on a small, steeply sloping slab that I could tell was dropping me toward the huge abyss on the south side of the ridge. Although the belay was secure, and I was still &lt;i&gt;sitting&lt;/i&gt; on a slab, I am also a wuss when it comes to exposure. I muttered my displeasure with the airy belay as Dirk climbed around a roof and out of site.  Luckily I was in the dark, so at least I couldn&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;t see the drop off below. Then Conness finally let the moon out. As I sat on my windy perch, I watched with increasing discomfort as the moonlight illuminated the chasm below.  I was more than ready to climb on when Dirk shouted back.    &lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Dirk traverse left into the class 4 gully in order to save time on the next pitch. He was irritated that we didn&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;t do the route as purely as he wanted, but I was fine with the idea of moving to less exposed terrain - at this point I felt that staying on the ridge for 90% of the route was good enough! We had one more pitch of 4th class climbing and then we unroped. The climbing was suddenly easy class 2-3, with no exposure, so we dispensed with the belay and hurried up to the summit. As we scrambled the last few hundred feet, I asked Dirk how many pitched we had climbed. Neither of us could remember, having lost count somewhere over 10 pitches, so we figured we had done about 14 roped pitches on the route.   &lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Reaching the summit was a glorious occasion. We whooped with relief, and eagerly signed the summit register. It was 5am.    &lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-IRunymAf3wk/Tg7RNhXT5BI/AAAAAAAAPK8/ltMBLO7_jDI/s2000/MtConness-East%2520Ridge9.jpg\" style=\"text-align:-webkit-center\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-IRunymAf3wk/Tg7RNhXT5BI/AAAAAAAAPK8/ltMBLO7_jDI/s500/MtConness-East%2520Ridge9.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Mt Conness at sunrise.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;The scramble down was tiring, but easy. A brief catwalk on the East Ridge required some attention, but after that it was smooth sailing all the way down. Now we were in a hurry to get down before the other AAC members noticed that we hadn&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;t returned last night. We made it back to the car at 9am &amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#147; exactly 24 hours after we had left it the day before.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;&lt;table border=\"0\" width=\"200\"&gt;\r\n&lt;tbody&gt;\r\n&lt;tr&gt;\r\n&lt;td&gt;&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-APxSoqGYrdM/Tg7R1ciTGTI/AAAAAAAAPN4/tkYHiV6BtPk/s2000/Mt%2520Coness%2520via%2520West%2520Ridge.JPG\" style=\"text-align:-webkit-center\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"\" src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-APxSoqGYrdM/Tg7R1ciTGTI/AAAAAAAAPN4/tkYHiV6BtPk/s800/Mt%2520Coness%2520via%2520West%2520Ridge.JPG\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Topo map of the climb from the Saddlebag Lake TH.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;\r\n&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;Acirc;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\r\n&lt;/tr&gt;\r\n&lt;tr&gt;\r\n&lt;td&gt;&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-7eX3yqaHDYw/Tg7Ry66qbNI/AAAAAAAAPNw/x3vmp5PSSAY/s2000/Mt%2520Coness%2520Profile%2520via%2520West%2520Ridge.JPG\" style=\"text-align:-webkit-center\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"\" src=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-7eX3yqaHDYw/Tg7Ry66qbNI/AAAAAAAAPNw/x3vmp5PSSAY/s800/Mt%2520Coness%2520Profile%2520via%2520West%2520Ridge.JPG\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Route profile of our climb.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\r\n&lt;/tr&gt;\r\n&lt;/tbody&gt;\r\n&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;h2&gt;\r\n&lt;a name=\"TOC-Afterword\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Afterword&lt;/h2&gt;\r\n   \r\n\r\nSince Dirk, Vito, Gus and I carpooled to the trailhead together, Dirk and I had expected to hitchhike back to camp. Instead, we were surprised to see the car was still parked beside the road, empty.  Vito and Gus left the car. Did they not make it back last night?    \r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;First thing&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;s first &amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#147; we took the car and drove down to the AAC camp to avoid being reported overdue. Once we get there, the camp was empty, except for a note saying that we were reported overdue. Shit!     &lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Eventually we managed to find the AAC group and call off our overdue status. Vito and Gus reappeared later in the day too. Apparently they had backed off of their route, and in the dark they had gotten lost on the cross country travel around Mt Conness. They too spent the night in the mountains, and when the sun rose they found themselves at the road in Tuolomne Meadows!   &lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;After some beers and a nap, it was time to go home, but my adventure wasn&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;t over yet.  Paul&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;s car broke down just outside of Yosemite, and ultimately we had to be towed to a dealership in Walnut Creek, over 4 hours away. While we waiting on a street corner in Walnut Creek with all of our gear, some bored cops harassed us until Paul&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;s girlfriend in San Francisco was able to pick us up. Finally, I arrived home at about 2am.     &lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;I was completely exhausted, but the trip was great. I couldn&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;t wait to meet up with Dirk to take a crack at Mt Sill.   &lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;hr width=\"80%\"&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;i&gt;Mark N\' Dirk\'s Bivouac Trilogy:&lt;/i&gt; &lt;a href=\"http://www.markpthomas.com/mountaineering/trip-reports/california/mark-n-dirk-s-bivouac-trilogy---part-2-mt-sill\"&gt;Part 2: Mt Sill&lt;/a&gt; -  &lt;a href=\"http://www.markpthomas.com/mountaineering/trip-reports/california/mark-n-dirk-s-bivouac-trilogy---part-3-north-palisade-polemonium\"&gt;Part 3: N Palisade &amp;amp; Polemonium&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;hr&gt;\r\n&lt;hr&gt;\r\n&lt;h2&gt;\r\n&lt;a name=\"TOC-Links\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Links&lt;/h2&gt;\r\n&lt;ul&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://picasaweb.google.com/105894936663116565516/20030817MtConnessWestRidgeIV56WithDirk?authuser=0&amp;amp;feat=directlink\"&gt;Picasa Album&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://www.summitpost.org/mark-n-dirk-s-bivouac-trilogy-part-1-mt-conness/170009\"&gt;SummitPost TR&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;/ul&gt;\r\n&lt;/div&gt;\r\n&lt;/div&gt; \r\n'),(69,39,'/mountaineering/trip-reports/california/mt-goode-n-buttress','Mt Goode (N Buttress)','North Buttress of Goode (III, 5.9+)','Trip_Report','content: &lt;div dir=\"ltr\"&gt;\r\n&lt;h1&gt;\r\n&lt;a name=\"TOC-North-Buttress-of-Goode-III-5.9-\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;North Buttress of Goode (III, 5.9+)&lt;/h1&gt;\r\n&lt;h2&gt;\r\n&lt;a name=\"TOC-June-16-2012\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;June 16, 2012&lt;/h2&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-NQgHFRn0WnI/T-AeYKRlYII/AAAAAAABJLU/xyrhv362g1g/s2000/2012-06-16%2520-%252027%2520-%2520Nic%2520leading%2520the%2520P3%2520traverse.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-NQgHFRn0WnI/T-AeYKRlYII/AAAAAAABJLU/xyrhv362g1g/s600/2012-06-16%2520-%252027%2520-%2520Nic%2520leading%2520the%2520P3%2520traverse.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Nic starting the P3 lead (5.9 face traverse).

We drove through the night and immediately left the trailhead at 3:30 am, reaching the base of the route at 5:30 am. We ate breakfast and enjoyed the alpenglow as the sun rose and warmed the rock. We started P1 at 7:30 and topped out about 3pm. The route was great! While there was some loose rock, it was no worse than Temple Crag. The route gave us everything from face climbing to wild mantels &amp;amp; stems, finger to fist cracks, OW &amp;amp; chimneys. The 5.9 pitches were stout, and the traversing pitch was runout. There was a fast team from Bishop that was also on the route behind us.

Then I got to the knifeblade piton and couldn\'t find enough features to use to get to the second corner. I hesitated to unclip the piton, as I was worried about taking a swing into the unknown around the corner, but I wasn\'t sure if I could reach back to unclip it. I climbed up, climbed down, and eventually decided I could backclean. A few delicate smears and I grabbed the edge, reached back and unclipped the piton, then swing back around the corner and onto a narrow ledge.\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\nIt was good I did the crux this way! I had to climb another 15 ft or so on a narrow ledge and down into the chimmney, where the next piece of pro was - a slung chockstone. If the follower unclips the piton and falls, they would take about a 15-20 ft blind pendulum around the corner and splatter into the 5.9 face climb to the left of the chimney. This face had sparse pro (Nic made good use of the C3 cams), and was only slightly easier than the crux. Nic had to wander all over the face to find pro and find his way through, as the two didn\'t really coincide. After an hour of nervous following, I finally made it up to the belay ledge.\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"http://lh5.ggpht.com/-nTftukW8LDI/T-AecKd0tEI/AAAAAAABJLs/6EoawE1lF0w/s2000/2012-06-16%252520-%25252032%252520-%252520Looking%252520down%252520chimney%252520%252526%252520face%252520of%252520P3.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"http://lh5.ggpht.com/-nTftukW8LDI/T-AecKd0tEI/AAAAAAABJLs/6EoawE1lF0w/s600/2012-06-16%252520-%25252032%252520-%252520Looking%252520down%252520chimney%252520%252526%252520face%252520of%252520P3.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Looking down the chimney (left) or 5.9 with poor pro (right) variations of P3.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;h2&gt;\r\n&lt;a name=\"TOC-Pitch-4\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Pitch 4&lt;/h2&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"http://lh6.ggpht.com/-IcAAvrznZ7o/T-Aecsz75cI/AAAAAAABJLw/sOiYOOi8qMw/s2000/2012-06-16%252520-%25252033%252520-%252520Nic%252520leading%252520P4.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"http://lh6.ggpht.com/-IcAAvrznZ7o/T-Aecsz75cI/AAAAAAABJLw/sOiYOOi8qMw/s600/2012-06-16%252520-%25252033%252520-%252520Nic%252520leading%252520P4.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Nic leading P4 (5.5).

Humphreys. Such sayings, while both masochistic and depraved, also seemed to embody the spirit of our intended winter objective.  I&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;ve wanted to climb the East Arete of Mount Humphreys for years now as a mixed snow and rock climb, and I&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;ve twice gotten high on the route without success. But this time I fully understood what climbing the route in those conditions would entail, and I had a partner with the resolve to see things through with me. \r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\nThe East Arete (II, 5.5) up 13,986&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153; Mt Humphreys is one of the 100 Classic Climbs of the High Sierra. Peter Croft upped the ante by recommending the full East Ridge (III, 5.5.) in his listing of the &amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#156;Good, the Great, and the Awesome&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#157; of the High Sierra. This variation is several times longer, requires over twice as much elevation gain, and requires climbing up and over the 13,000 ft &amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#152;gendarme&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153; on the ridge that to me seemed more like a pretty decent subpeak. Overall, the Full East Ridge, from where you first start climbing rock to the summit, is 0.9 miles long and gains about 2,330 ft, which is longer with more elevation gain than the Thunderbolt to Sill Traverse and &amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#147; at least in winter &amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#147; seemed harder (sans the summit blocks) and more alpine in nature .

Not out of design, but more an afterthought of realizing that conditions were good, and that my next main objective of the Petit Griffon, shared with my friends, was being delayed to wait for Shane and &amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#152;Ski to return from their Orgy of Ice in Ouray. Vitaliy was game for taking advantage of the unusually good conditions and stable weather, so the climb was on.\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;table&gt;\r\n&lt;tbody&gt;\r\n&lt;tr&gt;\r\n&lt;td&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-OQ1pxCP0ZMk/Tm-nTMnxQVI/AAAAAAACMIQ/jxw12xXCrwQ/s2000/2011-02-11%2520-%252001%2520-%2520Humphreys%2520%2526%2520Basin%2520Mtn%2520at%2520Sunrise.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-OQ1pxCP0ZMk/Tm-nTMnxQVI/AAAAAAACMIQ/jxw12xXCrwQ/s200/2011-02-11%2520-%252001%2520-%2520Humphreys%2520%2526%2520Basin%2520Mtn%2520at%2520Sunrise.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Humphreys &amp;amp; Basin Mtn&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;/td&gt;\r\n&lt;td&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-NanwHeqNg04/Tm-nQDyrHXI/AAAAAAAAwfk/re9_bHbxYrY/s2000/2011-02-11%2520-%252002%2520-%2520Mt%2520Tom%2520at%2520Sunrise.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-NanwHeqNg04/Tm-nQDyrHXI/AAAAAAAAwfk/re9_bHbxYrY/s200/2011-02-11%2520-%252002%2520-%2520Mt%2520Tom%2520at%2520Sunrise.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Mt Tom&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;/td&gt;\r\n&lt;td&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-aBmt_4E99E0/Tm-nTzWFsdI/AAAAAAACMIc/301RGPEEntw/s2000/2011-02-11%2520-%252005%2520-%2520Four%2520Gables%2520at%2520Sunrise.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-aBmt_4E99E0/Tm-nTzWFsdI/AAAAAAACMIc/301RGPEEntw/s200/2011-02-11%2520-%252005%2520-%2520Four%2520Gables%2520at%2520Sunrise.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Four Gables Area&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;/td&gt;\r\n&lt;td&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-8MmWr6xWVOE/Tm-nQ7IhqvI/AAAAAAACMIw/zJnOLJiVhD0/s2000/2011-02-11%2520-%252008%2520-%2520Humphreys%2520at%2520Sunrise.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-8MmWr6xWVOE/Tm-nQ7IhqvI/AAAAAAACMIw/zJnOLJiVhD0/s200/2011-02-11%2520-%252008%2520-%2520Humphreys%2520at%2520Sunrise.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Mt Humphreys&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;/td&gt;\r\n&lt;/tr&gt;\r\n&lt;tr&gt;\r\n&lt;td colspan=\"4\"&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;&lt;b&gt;Sunrise over the High Sierra&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;/td&gt;\r\n&lt;/tr&gt;\r\n&lt;/tbody&gt;\r\n&lt;/table&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis time, to make the trip a little different for me, I chose to camp on the north side of the ridge at 11,000 ft. I admit part of this was comparing the views in Google Earth and realized the north side would offer much better views of the mountains for my photography fun. We would approach from the Buttermilks and ascend to a camp at 11,000 ft on our first day. Second day we&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;d expected to climb the route and be down after a long effort, with a third day set aside to hike out and drive home.\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;table&gt;\r\n&lt;tbody&gt;\r\n&lt;tr&gt;\r\n&lt;td&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-VLRf5SepkH8/Tm-nUXQzRgI/AAAAAAACtAE/G2eiERcpVTo/s2000/2011-02-11%2520-%252006%2520-%2520Paiute%2520Crags%2520%2526%2520Mt%2520Emerson%2520-%2520annotate.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-VLRf5SepkH8/Tm-nUXQzRgI/AAAAAAACtAE/G2eiERcpVTo/s260/2011-02-11%2520-%252006%2520-%2520Paiute%2520Crags%2520%2526%2520Mt%2520Emerson%2520-%2520annotate.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Paiute Crags &amp;amp; Mt Emerson&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;/td&gt;\r\n&lt;td&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-MzDzEym1UKw/Tm-nVjSAPwI/AAAAAAACtAM/omU59ky9z70/s2000/2011-02-11%2520-%252007%2520-%2520Checkered%2520Demon%2520-%2520annotated.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-MzDzEym1UKw/Tm-nVjSAPwI/AAAAAAACtAM/omU59ky9z70/s260/2011-02-11%2520-%252007%2520-%2520Checkered%2520Demon%2520-%2520annotated.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Mt Locke &amp;amp; Checkered Demon&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;/td&gt;\r\n&lt;td&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-01Qe57XtV5U/Tm-nZCXea4I/AAAAAAACtAU/NcdAhwTcosU/s2000/2011-02-11%2520-%252011%2520-%2520Eastern%2520Sierra%2520Panorama%2520at%2520Sunrise%2520-%2520annotated.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-01Qe57XtV5U/Tm-nZCXea4I/AAAAAAACtAU/NcdAhwTcosU/s260/2011-02-11%2520-%252011%2520-%2520Eastern%2520Sierra%2520Panorama%2520at%2520Sunrise%2520-%2520annotated.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Sierra Panorama from the Buttermilks&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;/td&gt;\r\n&lt;/tr&gt;\r\n&lt;/tbody&gt;\r\n&lt;/table&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOn Friday we drove as high into the Buttermilks as we could to start the climb. I had hoped to start at about 7,500&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;, where one can usually get to with a 2WD vehicle when the dirt roads are dry, but the heavy season snows forced us to start 1,000 ft lower and 2 miles further out at 6,500 ft. It was surreal starting so low. We walked amongst boulders and sagebrush on a flat valley bottom towards the gleaming white peaks in the distance. They looked so small and far away, but we knew that they still rose over 7,000 ft above us. We had a ways to go.\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-3bHtsovC4d8/Tm-nhHE-JTI/AAAAAAACtAk/HpJaFEYTOGg/s2000/2011-02-11%2520-%252022%2520-%2520Vitaliy%2520starting%2520out%2520-%2520annotated.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-3bHtsovC4d8/Tm-nhHE-JTI/AAAAAAACtAk/HpJaFEYTOGg/s800/2011-02-11%2520-%252022%2520-%2520Vitaliy%2520starting%2520out%2520-%2520annotated.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;This approach gets more tedious every time.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTedious walking on the gradually steepening desert valley transitioned to steeper slopes with pine trees, and finally, the alpine cirques that we sought. After 5 hours of climbing we set up our Mega-Light camp at 11,000 ft below the north face of Mt Humphreys.

Away went the crampons and out came the rope. Now was the time for the real fun. The rock looked great ahead, though we weren&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;t sure how fast we&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;d move climbing with our boots on. \r\n  &lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;table&gt;\r\n&lt;tbody&gt;\r\n&lt;tr&gt;\r\n&lt;td&gt;&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-BqURe6CTEcQ/Tm-nw6D1YZI/AAAAAAAAwi0/cgbq_9RyqTA/s2000/2011-02-12%2520-%252002%2520-%2520Basin%2520Mtn%2520at%2520sunrise.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"\" src=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-BqURe6CTEcQ/Tm-nw6D1YZI/AAAAAAAAwi0/cgbq_9RyqTA/s400/2011-02-12%2520-%252002%2520-%2520Basin%2520Mtn%2520at%2520sunrise.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Basin Mtn at Sunrise&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\r\n&lt;/tr&gt;\r\n&lt;/tbody&gt;\r\n&lt;/table&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n  \r\n  The terrain steepened immediately, and fortunately the vibram soles of my Nepal Evos gripped the rock well enough to leave me confident enough to push upwards. When feet were questionable, the rock usually offered a good jam for some security. There were a few problematic slab sections that would have been easy in summer in tennis shoes or rock shoes without snow, but such terrain was off limits for us. On one slab section I shimmied up some wide slanting cracks to gain the knife-edge ridge, and then shuffled a cheval along the crest. \r\n  &lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;Lesson:&lt;/b&gt; When simul-climbing, you really should take care to keep the rope out of your crotch &amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#147; especially when climbing a cheval!&lt;/i&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;table&gt;\r\n&lt;tbody&gt;\r\n&lt;tr&gt;\r\n&lt;td&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-i5PuvmCiXfs/Tm-nzM4K2yI/AAAAAAACMLo/WtLQnJbw2Bo/s2000/2011-02-12%2520-%252005%2520-%2520Lower%2520E%2520Ridge.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-i5PuvmCiXfs/Tm-nzM4K2yI/AAAAAAACMLo/WtLQnJbw2Bo/s260/2011-02-12%2520-%252005%2520-%2520Lower%2520E%2520Ridge.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Lower 1,000 ft of the Route&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;/td&gt;\r\n&lt;td&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-OkfmLxcM02s/Tm-n6XDI9eI/AAAAAAACML0/7DruyM_7c88/s2000/2011-02-12%2520-%252008%2520-%2520One%2520crux%2520section.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-OkfmLxcM02s/Tm-n6XDI9eI/AAAAAAACML0/7DruyM_7c88/s260/2011-02-12%2520-%252008%2520-%2520One%2520crux%2520section.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;A Cheval!&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;/td&gt;\r\n&lt;td&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-bzWDVn1M47A/Tm-n8_x6qJI/AAAAAAACML8/mxY2Q5O6Ae8/s2000/2011-02-12%2520-%252010%2520-%2520Magic%2520McGee.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-bzWDVn1M47A/Tm-n8_x6qJI/AAAAAAACML8/mxY2Q5O6Ae8/s260/2011-02-12%2520-%252010%2520-%2520Magic%2520McGee.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Looking Back&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;/td&gt;\r\n&lt;/tr&gt;\r\n&lt;tr&gt;\r\n&lt;td&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-GiiYIrfh33I/Tm-n7iztvLI/AAAAAAACML4/NsHE7m_G9Kc/s2000/2011-02-12%2520-%252009%2520-%2520Peter%2520Croft%2520Ridge.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-GiiYIrfh33I/Tm-n7iztvLI/AAAAAAACML4/NsHE7m_G9Kc/s260/2011-02-12%2520-%252009%2520-%2520Peter%2520Croft%2520Ridge.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Ridge of Peter Croft Fame&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;/td&gt;\r\n&lt;td&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-uyLbXRd_shE/Tm-n-4Sil6I/AAAAAAACMMM/VRGS0vaZZUk/s2000/2011-02-12%2520-%252014%2520-%2520Vitaliy%2520at%2520Peter%2520Croft%2520Ridge.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-uyLbXRd_shE/Tm-n-4Sil6I/AAAAAAACMMM/VRGS0vaZZUk/s260/2011-02-12%2520-%252014%2520-%2520Vitaliy%2520at%2520Peter%2520Croft%2520Ridge.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Will the Real Peter Croft Please Stand Up?&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;/td&gt;\r\n&lt;td&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-WucYaYqkG7Y/Tm-oAbwAyPI/AAAAAAACMMU/7Zz5Haiw2rc/s2000/2011-02-12%2520-%252016%2520-%2520Vitaliy%2520at%2520Peter%2520Croft%2520Ridge.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-WucYaYqkG7Y/Tm-oAbwAyPI/AAAAAAACMMU/7Zz5Haiw2rc/s260/2011-02-12%2520-%252016%2520-%2520Vitaliy%2520at%2520Peter%2520Croft%2520Ridge.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;The More Rational Way to Climb This Section&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;/td&gt;\r\n&lt;/tr&gt;\r\n&lt;/tbody&gt;\r\n&lt;/table&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\nThe lower ridge was a joy to climb - mostly class 3, with some class 4 and a few low to mid-5th class sections. The rock was very clean and solid and was warm in the winter sun. Soon enough Vitaliy and I reached the famed &amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#156;Peter Croft&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#157; section of the East Ridge, well known for the photo of Peter Croft walking in a precarious balance on the knife-edge crest. Sadly the photos make this look more awesome than it really is. True, you can walk along the crest, but there is a nice crack that runs along the side that you can also traverse on, using the ridge crest as a handrail. Alas, like so many other inspiring shots I&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;ve seen in climbing books, this one was totally contrived.\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;table width=\"480\"&gt;\r\n&lt;tbody&gt;\r\n&lt;tr&gt;\r\n&lt;td&gt;&lt;div class=\"sites-embed-align-center-wrapping-off\"&gt;&lt;div class=\"sites-embed-border-off sites-embed\" style=\"width:425px;\"&gt;&lt;div class=\"sites-embed-content sites-embed-type-youtube\"&gt;&lt;iframe title=\"YouTube video player\" class=\"youtube-player\" type=\"text/html\" src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/Vpg1RMOatkk?rel=0&amp;amp;wmode=opaque\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" width=\"425\" height=\"355\"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\r\n&lt;/tr&gt;\r\n&lt;tr&gt;\r\n&lt;td&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;After climbing about 800 ft of cl. 4 to low 5th rock, we traversed on snow slopes on a bypass to ascend the gendarme on our way to Humphreys.

We traversed on 40 degree snow slopes and up a steep chute, bypassed a steep chock stone, and climbed through mixed snow and class 3 as we rounded the gendarme to the south. As I rounded the corner I jumped back onto rock as soon as possible and found the rock to be even more clean and solid than the lower ridge. The class 3-4 scrambling was continuous, steep, and exposed with a great backdrop of Mt Humphreys still rising nearly another 1,000 ft above us.\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-V17K6vfVM_4/Tm-oBbWFyRI/AAAAAAACMMg/JsXb33uhvJg/s2000/2011-02-12%2520-%252018%2520-%252013k%2520Gendarme.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-V17K6vfVM_4/Tm-oBbWFyRI/AAAAAAACMMg/JsXb33uhvJg/s800/2011-02-12%2520-%252018%2520-%252013k%2520Gendarme.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Back to some steep snow traversing for a bypass.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\nAs I crested the 13,000 ft gendarme I was dismayed to see how much the terrain dropped down to the notch separating us from the East Arete of Mount Humphreys. I thought we were making decent time with the amount of daylight we had, but by now it was about noon, we were still a ways away from the ar&amp;Atilde;&amp;ordf;te, and we need to lose about 300 feet and cross over two lesser gendarmes to get there. Gendarme?! This really is a genuine subpeak!\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\nI tried to pick up the pace in the simul-climbing. The climbing became sustained class 4 with increasing exposure as the rock turned back into a knife edge as it dropped steeply to the notch. Most of the climbing involved descending cracks, chutes, and some short face sections a short ways off the crest, and then traversing along thin ledges to rejoin the crest, almost like descending a large staircase. Although the exposure was pretty high, the climbing was very solid and got more fun as we got deeper into it. I placed a piece every now and then since running pro wasn&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;t as reliable.\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-CN9zsG1OGA0/Tm-oFI0tETI/AAAAAAACMM0/L7MDYejDmTY/s2000/2011-02-12%2520-%252022%2520-%2520Vitaliy%2520following%2520on%252013k%2520gendarme.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-CN9zsG1OGA0/Tm-oFI0tETI/AAAAAAACMM0/L7MDYejDmTY/s800/2011-02-12%2520-%252022%2520-%2520Vitaliy%2520following%2520on%252013k%2520gendarme.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Downclimbing the 13k Gendarme&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\n&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#156;Mark! Stop! I want a belay!&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#157; Vitaliy shouted. Apparently he wasn&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;t having as good of a time on this terrain as I was. A cost he was paying by climbing in plastic ice climbing boots. I had gambled on wearing colder leather boots, and though I&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;d pay for that later, for now I was reaping the benefits of the extra grip and nimbleness. I belayed Vitaliy in to my belay at a notch in the ridge, and after looking at the route ahead, we discussed our options.\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\n&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#156;I don&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;t know about our speed,&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#157; I said. &amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#156;We still have a ways to go and we really need to speed up if we aren&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;t going to bivy&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#157;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\n&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#156;Mark, I might want to pitch it out more often if the terrain stays like this. I&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;m not as secure as you in my plastic boots.  Let&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;s descend the snow couloir from this notch and rejoin the route after these towers. We&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;ll avoid this terrain and make up time.&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#157;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-2oBNvTCuT9s/Tm-oCP8nqZI/AAAAAAACMMw/TUdv1XsEslY/s2000/2011-02-12%2520-%252021%2520-%2520Mt%2520Humphreys%2520upper%2520E%2520Ridge.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-2oBNvTCuT9s/Tm-oCP8nqZI/AAAAAAACMMw/TUdv1XsEslY/s800/2011-02-12%2520-%252021%2520-%2520Mt%2520Humphreys%2520upper%2520E%2520Ridge.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Mt Humphreys from the 13k Gendarme&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\nWe had a back-and-forth about what to do. I thought we were skipping potentially the best part of the route, and knowing that we had some rappels coming up, I wasn&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;t convinced that downclimbing the snow couloirs and re-ascending to the route via the regular approach would be faster. I also pointed out that if we pitched it out too much as the terrain got easier (at least it seemed to me), we&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;d definitely spend the night up there. Vitaliy was adamant on skipping the next ridge section and was more optimistic than me in our ability to finish the route in the daylight we had left.\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\nSo down we went. As I kick stepped down it became harder and harder to get in good steps. To my surprise, although we were descending a southwest slope in winter, we had strayed onto snow heavily laden with water ice! There was a deep blue in my foot steps and sometimes I had to kick 5 or 6 times as hard as I could to get the tiniest of footholds. I especially didn&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;t like that I only had one tool out, since a self-arrest seemed unlikely.\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\nI downclimbed extra cautiously and at the first opportunity I stepped over to a moat to put on crampons and get out my other tool.\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\nAhhh! Relief!&lt;/div&gt;\r\n&lt;div&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&amp;Acirc;&amp;nbsp;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n&lt;h2&gt;\r\n&lt;a name=\"TOC-The-East-Arete\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;The East Arete&lt;/h2&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-pZGxDrR-zzY/Tm-oDpV9UYI/AAAAAAACtA0/qloREhzOUZE/s2000/2011-02-12%2520-%252020%2520-%2520Mt%2520Humphreys%2520upper%2520E%2520Ridge%2520-%2520annotate.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-pZGxDrR-zzY/Tm-oDpV9UYI/AAAAAAACtA0/qloREhzOUZE/s800/2011-02-12%2520-%252020%2520-%2520Mt%2520Humphreys%2520upper%2520E%2520Ridge%2520-%2520annotate.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;The East Arete&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\nGaining the start of the standard route was more exciting than expected. Although I had climbed up to this area on failed attempt #2, we stopped at the junction of the couloirs, and the base of the route &lt;i&gt;looked&lt;/i&gt; close. It was a lot steeper than it appeared, too, reaching about 50 degrees on the top half. Once we were at the notch I traversed onto 4th class ramps (now covered in steep snow) and up a 4th class chute, entering the route after making an awkward exit onto the rock in my crampons.\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\nVitaliy joined me soon thereafter and we pressed on, scrambling in our crampons on the easy 3rd class terrain as the sun drifter farther west in the sky. We knew we were still only in the earlier section of the ar&amp;Atilde;&amp;ordf;te but already the 13,000 ft gendarme was receding far below. And then we reached the crux headwall.\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-4tId_Tabx30/Tm-oGONj8oI/AAAAAAACMNA/IYwcMWxIiD0/s2000/2011-02-12%2520-%252024%2520-%252013k%2520gendarme.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-4tId_Tabx30/Tm-oGONj8oI/AAAAAAACMNA/IYwcMWxIiD0/s640/2011-02-12%2520-%252024%2520-%252013k%2520gendarme.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;The 13k Gendarme gets smaller&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\nThe headwall looked pretty intimidating. I recalled the route description saying that the route traverses left on an improbable ledge to bypass the headwall. I saw two such ledges. The lower one had snow on it and appeared to end in a clean drop-off, and I couldn&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;t tell if I could reach across. The upper one looked a little thin but pretty straightforward as it started at the right end of the face and traversed up and left, wrapping around the edge at mid-height.\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\nSo off came the crampons and up I started. Immediately I began to have misgivings. I climbed a series of juggy flakes that stuck out of the rock like I was ascending the spine of a stegosaur. The moves were solid, but the traverse was &lt;i&gt;VERY&lt;/i&gt; steep and there was no pro! I got in one marginal piece before topping out and then traversed to what seemed like the straightforward part of the headwall. There was a thin crack that wrapped nicely around the corner, but no face holds above. I lowered myself down a ramp that lead to a ledge below the crack (the ramp was too slick for my boots to grip). The rock pushed me back far enough that I felt on the verge of toppling, and I could see that I would bounce to the ground before my last piece of pro would come into action. The boots and pack did not help with my feeling of security here.\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-wdLj1A6SUlA/T3i6JgQjqMI/AAAAAAACMNM/RuHMIkHyW9M/s2000/2011-02-12%2520-%252025a%2520-%2520Leading%2520the%2520Crux%2520-%2520Vitaliy.JPG\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-wdLj1A6SUlA/T3i6JgQjqMI/AAAAAAACMNM/RuHMIkHyW9M/s640/2011-02-12%2520-%252025a%2520-%2520Leading%2520the%2520Crux%2520-%2520Vitaliy.JPG\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Climbing Through the Headwall&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\nI calmed myself, took a deep breath, and looked again at the lower ledge. It didn&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;t look any better, going back to it would be a pain, and I was so close! I decided to suck it up and exhaust my reasonable options before giving up in fear. I slotted in a nut behind a crumbly flake. I didn&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;t like the idea of taking a hard fall on this, so I also slotted in a 0.5&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#157; Metolius Power Cam and clipped in my other double rope. I could get some very marginal finger jams above the ledge, but I had no feet. This seemed way too hard for the advertised low-5th class difficulty rating. With the pro in, I reversed the ramp and explored the crack once more. It was just wide enough to slide my feet along in it, but there was nothing to keep me from toppling out. I committed to the crack, underclinging it while shuffling my feet for the first few moves. I reached out for the corner I aimed to reach and found a side-pull. \r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;At last some stability! &lt;/b&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\nI finished shuffling my feet along the crack and embraced the solid jams of the cracks around the corner. This was a lot scarier and harder than I had imagined. It felt more like 5.8 in boots rather than 5.4. &lt;i&gt; (I now think that I went the wrong way and should have traversed lower down as I never encountered the steep &amp;amp; exposed low 5th class cracks beginning at a ledge). &lt;/i&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-MLB0qKcB5nQ/Tm-oG1hvhZI/AAAAAAACtA8/SHqSmOxRH3A/s2000/2011-02-12%2520-%252025%2520-%2520Crux%2520-%2520annotated.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-MLB0qKcB5nQ/Tm-oG1hvhZI/AAAAAAACtA8/SHqSmOxRH3A/s640/2011-02-12%2520-%252025%2520-%2520Crux%2520-%2520annotated.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Headwall Crux&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\nI flew up the easier cracks and up ahead I saw a nice large flat belay ledge. Then one of the ropes came taught. Rope drag was eating my pink rope alive! I so desperately wanted the nice belay 20 ft ahead over a hanging gear belay in the crack that I placed a piece of pro, untied from the pink rope, tied it off to the pro, and continued up on the yellow rope.\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\nThe flat ledge turned out to be the rappel station for the route, making this pitch a good reassessment point. Vitaliy followed the crux headwall with scarcely less trepidation than I did, partly because the route left him vulnerable to a big pendulum fall. He aided on my nut to get through the ledge, and upon reaching the belay told me that the cam had fallen out.\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;i&gt;SHUDDER. &lt;/i&gt; Well, I guess I&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;m glad that I&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;m conservative enough with my climbing ability that I haven&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;t fallen on lead yet!\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\nThough the sun was still high in the sky, shadows were growing longer over the crest and I was certain that we&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;d be lucky to make it to the summit before dark, much less descend the route.  I breached the subject to Vitaliy, but staying totally open to the idea of heading up in light of the good weather and our bivy provisions. \r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\nAnd up we went.&lt;/div&gt;\r\n&lt;div&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&amp;Acirc;&amp;nbsp;\r\n\r\n\r\n&lt;h2&gt;\r\n&lt;a name=\"TOC-The-Bivy\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;The Bivy&lt;/h2&gt;\r\n\r\nBased on our elevation it looked like we were nearly on the top, but what you can&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;t tell from the foreshortening in photographs is that there is a lot of low angle knife edge climbing before the end. With our fatigue, increased snow mixed with rock, and darkening skies, we pitched it out thinking that the plateau was one more pitch away. Then one more pitch. Then one more? Yeah, it looked like one more.\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\nAt last I belayed Vitaliy up to a nice belay on a set of large boulders and laid out our options:\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;ol&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;We can descend in the dark, which would suck and I think is dangerous and unnecessary.\r\n&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;We can go to the summit in the dark and bivy on the way down. \r\n&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;We can bivy sooner and then decide whether to summit or just descend the next day. This is my preference.\r\n&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;/ol&gt;\r\n\r\nVitaliy, ever the adventurous soul, opted for option number 3.\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\n&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#156;How about we dig a snow cave in the deep snow here? Maybe near that rock?&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#157; he suggested. &amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#156;You know how to make snow shelters better than me so how about I belay you from here and you dig it out.&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#157;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\nWhile some people might think that he was getting the better end of the deal here as he got to rest at the nice belay while I worked and crawled in the snow,  you actually get very warm when digging snow caves. I walked over to the snow drifted around the large rock and commenced &lt;b&gt;Operation Wombat Burrow.&lt;/b&gt; Before long I was hollowing out a nice snowcave, but took breaks as I got tired and winded from the altitude. I tried out the various sleeping positions to make sure they were big and level enough and . . . . zzzzzz\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\n&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#156;Mark! What&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;s going on?!&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#157; Vitaliy yelled. Ooops! I was so warm and tired that I fell asleep inside the cave while &amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#152;trying out&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153; the positions I was digging out.

My feet had become numb from the final section of snow climbing (verdict &amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#147; Nepal Evos don&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;t keep my feet warm in snow in the winter), so I passed away the night massaging my feet and blowing on my toes while Vitaliy did some warming happy dance in his corner of the cave. Eventually my feet were comfy, I stowed them in my down mittens to keep them &lt;i&gt;EXTRA&lt;/i&gt; comfy, and after a lot of tossing &amp;amp; turning, found a position to sleep in. I don&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;t know if Vitaliy slept.\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;table&gt;\r\n&lt;tbody&gt;\r\n&lt;tr&gt;\r\n&lt;td&gt;&lt;div class=\"sites-embed-align-left-wrapping-off\"&gt;&lt;div class=\"sites-embed-border-off sites-embed\" style=\"width:425px;\"&gt;&lt;div class=\"sites-embed-content sites-embed-type-youtube\"&gt;&lt;iframe title=\"YouTube video player\" class=\"youtube-player\" type=\"text/html\" src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/TJWF6HRJHAU?rel=0&amp;amp;wmode=opaque\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" width=\"425\" height=\"355\"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\r\n&lt;td&gt;&lt;div class=\"sites-embed-align-left-wrapping-off\"&gt;&lt;div class=\"sites-embed-border-off sites-embed\" style=\"width:425px;\"&gt;&lt;div class=\"sites-embed-content sites-embed-type-youtube\"&gt;&lt;iframe title=\"YouTube video player\" class=\"youtube-player\" type=\"text/html\" src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/nMXLx5Cdcts?rel=0&amp;amp;wmode=opaque\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" width=\"425\" height=\"355\"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\r\n&lt;/tr&gt;\r\n&lt;/tbody&gt;\r\n&lt;/table&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;h2&gt;\r\n&lt;a name=\"TOC-Summitting-and-Descending\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Summitting and Descending&lt;/h2&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-kJx-bgG0pn8/Tm-oRGAmTxI/AAAAAAACtBE/GwRErJLjhaQ/s2000/2011-02-13%2520-%252004%2520-%2520Mt%2520Humphreys%2520Summit-annotate.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-kJx-bgG0pn8/Tm-oRGAmTxI/AAAAAAACtBE/GwRErJLjhaQ/s640/2011-02-13%2520-%252004%2520-%2520Mt%2520Humphreys%2520Summit-annotate.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Humphreys at Last!&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\nThe next day we were up just before sunrise and departed our humble abode just after sunrise. The summit plateau was still further away than expected (doh!) but soon enough we were at the scree bowl below Married Men&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;s Point. I dropped down to the left and took what looked like the easiest set of ramps and chimneys as they stepped up and right towards the summit. \r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\nThis section wasn&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;t as hard as the headwall, but it was definitely the second crux of the trip! The climbing was steep, with some interesting 5th class moves that helped me to work on my mantels to get around the &amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#156;lack-of-good-feet&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#157; problem. (Another technique I discovered lower on the ridge was the foot-less hand traverse, where you just let your legs dangle against the slab and rock back &amp;amp; forth on your arms). \r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;table&gt;\r\n&lt;tbody&gt;\r\n&lt;tr&gt;\r\n&lt;td&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-9I1NYzWm5EE/Tm-oimfpCBI/AAAAAAACMOE/F2gTtc8pSmI/s2000/2011-02-13%2520-%252007%2520-%2520Sierra%2520Backcountry.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-9I1NYzWm5EE/Tm-oimfpCBI/AAAAAAACMOE/F2gTtc8pSmI/s260/2011-02-13%2520-%252007%2520-%2520Sierra%2520Backcountry.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Sierra Winter Backcountry&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;/td&gt;\r\n&lt;td&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-XOuoqubG_X4/Tm-ojBtSAAI/AAAAAAACMOI/IBbJlxCgLSM/s2000/2011-02-13%2520-%252008%2520-%2520Sierra%2520Backcountry.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-XOuoqubG_X4/Tm-ojBtSAAI/AAAAAAACMOI/IBbJlxCgLSM/s260/2011-02-13%2520-%252008%2520-%2520Sierra%2520Backcountry.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Sierra Winter Backcountry&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;/td&gt;\r\n&lt;td&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-30A3eLRJUdI/Tm-ojxbsFvI/AAAAAAACMOM/Ut46lsvEzck/s2000/2011-02-13%2520-%252009%2520-%2520Sierra%2520Backcountry.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-30A3eLRJUdI/Tm-ojxbsFvI/AAAAAAACMOM/Ut46lsvEzck/s260/2011-02-13%2520-%252009%2520-%2520Sierra%2520Backcountry.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Sierra Winter Backcountry&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;/td&gt;\r\n&lt;/tr&gt;\r\n&lt;tr&gt;\r\n&lt;td&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-XL_QQYX8kRk/Tm-ohHlbVdI/AAAAAAACMN8/kSMSv7GivEs/s2000/2011-02-13%2520-%252005%2520-%2520Mt%2520Humphreys%2520N%2520Ridge.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-XL_QQYX8kRk/Tm-ohHlbVdI/AAAAAAACMN8/kSMSv7GivEs/s260/2011-02-13%2520-%252005%2520-%2520Mt%2520Humphreys%2520N%2520Ridge.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;N Ridge of Humphreys&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;/td&gt;\r\n&lt;td&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-zeRqmXHph34/Tm-olBrv5pI/AAAAAAACMOU/giXRH_HeR-w/s2000/2011-02-13%2520-%252011%2520-%2520Mt%2520Tom%2520%2526%2520Basin%2520Mtn%2520-%2520annoatated.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-zeRqmXHph34/Tm-olBrv5pI/AAAAAAACMOU/giXRH_HeR-w/s260/2011-02-13%2520-%252011%2520-%2520Mt%2520Tom%2520%2526%2520Basin%2520Mtn%2520-%2520annoatated.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;View to the North&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;/td&gt;\r\n&lt;td&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-iK3MUEX5lPU/Tm-okebf42I/AAAAAAACMOQ/MKpIsSvMbWI/s2000/2011-02-13%2520-%252010%2520-%2520Magic%2520McGee.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-iK3MUEX5lPU/Tm-okebf42I/AAAAAAACMOQ/MKpIsSvMbWI/s260/2011-02-13%2520-%252010%2520-%2520Magic%2520McGee.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;McGee &amp;amp; Our Camp Far Below&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;/td&gt;\r\n&lt;/tr&gt;\r\n&lt;/tbody&gt;\r\n&lt;/table&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\nAnd at last we were on the summit!

Crap. Vitaliy left his brights on again. That and the cops were bored tonight since their other reason for pulling us over was that we were going 45 mph in a 35 mph zone (no matter that the 35 mph sign was still 20 ft in front of us!).\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\nThe cop first came to my window and looked into my bleary, red eyes. I croaked a &amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#156;hello&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#157; before the cop walked around to Vitaliy&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;s side to explain why he pulled us over.

Your face and eyes are pretty red&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#157; the cop queries Vitaliy, who in his burned, cut, dirty, and disheveled appearance looked like a sad state of a human being. And I looked no better.\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\n&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#156;No, sir,&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#157; Vitaliy replied. &amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#156;We just got down from spending three days climbing Mt Humphreys.&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#157;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\n&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#156;Mt Humphreys?&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#157; The cop asked. &amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#156;Where is that?&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#157;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\nWhere indeed? The trip was already fading from memory, and though we still bore the battle wounds of our latest winter romp in the mountains, as we drove home Vitaliy and I already began discussing the next big winter climb.\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-nXG7DLkkvKc/Tm-nunUIbFI/AAAAAAACMLU/jajo6xqJ4b0/s2000/2011-02-11%2520-%252045%2520-%2520Camp%2520%2526%2520Humphreys%2520Label.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-nXG7DLkkvKc/Tm-nunUIbFI/AAAAAAACMLU/jajo6xqJ4b0/s640/2011-02-11%2520-%252045%2520-%2520Camp%2520%2526%2520Humphreys%2520Label.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;A Dream of a Winter Climb&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;hr&gt;\r\n&lt;hr&gt;\r\n&lt;h2&gt;\r\n&lt;a name=\"TOC-Links\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Links&lt;/h2&gt;\r\n&lt;ul&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://picasaweb.google.com/105894936663116565516/20110211to13MtHumphreysEArete02?authuser=0&amp;amp;feat=directlink\"&gt;Picasa Photos&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://www.summitpost.org/winter-ascent-of-the-full-east-ridge-of-mt-humphreys/701674\"&gt;SummitPost TR&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;/ul&gt;\r\n&lt;/div&gt;\r\n&lt;/div&gt; \r\n'),(71,41,'/mountaineering/trip-reports/california/isosceles-pk-w-face','Isosceles Pk (W Face)','Isosceles Pk (W Face)','Trip_Report','content: &lt;div dir=\"ltr\"&gt;\r\n&lt;h1&gt;\r\n&lt;a name=\"TOC-Isosceles-Pk-W-Face-\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Isosceles Pk (W Face)&lt;/h1&gt;\r\n&lt;h2&gt;\r\n&lt;a name=\"TOC-Monday-September-23-2013\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Monday, September 23, 2013&lt;/h2&gt;\r\n\r\n\r\nFor all of you wide climbers, here is a great wide climb that I found in the High Sierra. #5 and #6 C4 cams are a must, and the crux pitch had some sections reminiscent of Gripper. All of the pitches were sustained, and mostly continuous chimney or OW. While rated II 5.9 in Secor, compared to other OW that I have done, including the SW Face of Conness, this route warrants a 5.10a rating, and a grade III rating for how slow the pitches go with all of the wide.\r\n\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\nJared and I went out for a last attempt of the season to do Winchell\'s SW Ridge - the route requires a long day and early start, so warm weather and long days are helpful. We left the Bay Area a little before 4am, drove straight to the TH, hiked in fast and set up camp beneath Isosceles . . . and decided to do the II 5.9 route that splits the triangle as a quick approach day climb. No information was given on the route except the FA, rating, and vague description. While is is called the West Face, we felt like West Face \'Bisector\' was a more appropriate name - especially that now it is one of 3 routes on the West Face.\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\nUnfortunately, the climb took us into the night, so we arrived at camp too late and trashed for Winchell. No matter the time it took us. I think the route trashed us physically enough that Winchell would have been ruled out even if we had gotten back to camp before dark as planned :-)\r\n\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-3OHp9xlfv2M/UkPBVXoL2xI/AAAAAAACx9I/Ps-0znl37mM/s1600/2013-09-23%252520-%252520001%252520-%252520Isosceles%252520Pk%252520W%252520Face%252520-%252520IMG_3105.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-3OHp9xlfv2M/UkPBVXoL2xI/AAAAAAACx9I/Ps-0znl37mM/s800/2013-09-23%252520-%252520001%252520-%252520Isosceles%252520Pk%252520W%252520Face%252520-%252520IMG_3105.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;The South Lake Reservoir was shockingly empty when Steph Abegg and I passed by at the end of June.

After resting up a bit we traversed east near the ridge crest and made a gradual descent to the basin below, simul-climbing through cl. 4-5 terrain that was occasionally loose. We collapsed at our tent around midnight. So much for our planned 3am wakeup!

Somehow during the planning stages I had noted the route as a Grade IV climb, so although we were expecting a very long day, we brought along food &amp;amp; water &amp;amp; chose a start time assuming a Grade IV route. Add a recent early season snow storm to make the route more wintery, and getting lost on the descent, and you have a full value Type II Fun alpine climb!\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;table&gt;\r\n&lt;tbody&gt;\r\n&lt;tr&gt;\r\n&lt;td&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-1wjNEpGCvgg/T31nLJ408DI/AAAAAAABAys/NTTuacHPWzA/s2000/2010-09-11%2520-%252009%2520-%2520Lone%2520Pine%2520Peak%2520N%2520%2526%2520NE%2520Ridges%2520-%2520annotated.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-1wjNEpGCvgg/T31nLJ408DI/AAAAAAABAys/NTTuacHPWzA/s640/2010-09-11%2520-%252009%2520-%2520Lone%2520Pine%2520Peak%2520N%2520%2526%2520NE%2520Ridges%2520-%2520annotated.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;/td&gt;\r\n&lt;/tr&gt;\r\n&lt;tr&gt;\r\n&lt;td&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;N &amp;amp; NE Ridges of Lone Pine Peak&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;/td&gt;\r\n&lt;/tr&gt;\r\n&lt;/tbody&gt;\r\n&lt;/table&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\nThe route starts at the Lone Pine Campround at 5,900\' and follows the ridge to the summit at 12,942\', gaining just over 7,000 ft. If you count the ups &amp;amp; downs on the climb then we easily did 8,000 ft of gain. About 4,000 ft and 1.6 miles of that was scrambling to technical climbing. You come out near Whitney Portal, so you need to plan on how to get back to your car or be ready for a long walk.\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;table&gt;\r\n&lt;tbody&gt;\r\n&lt;tr&gt;\r\n&lt;td&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-BjVqA8l15ho/T35UFjwEKXI/AAAAAAABA0c/ELwz0zfPYxI/s2000/2011-10-22%2520-%252013a%2520-%2520LPP%2520from%2520lower%2520NRoLPP%2520-%2520annotated%2520-%2520cropped.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-BjVqA8l15ho/T35UFjwEKXI/AAAAAAABA0c/ELwz0zfPYxI/s640/2011-10-22%2520-%252013a%2520-%2520LPP%2520from%2520lower%2520NRoLPP%2520-%2520annotated%2520-%2520cropped.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;/td&gt;\r\n&lt;/tr&gt;\r\n&lt;tr&gt;\r\n&lt;td&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;Close up of the upper North Ridge of Lone Pine Peak.

This is accessed as a round-trip outing from the Meyson Lake trailhead and a cl. 2-3 scramble up a chute to the west before it meets the main route at the Notch at 11,500&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;, where the first section of 5th class is encountered. This is typically done as a full day outing car-to-car, with the route rated III 5.5-5.7 (it seems that no one has been able to find anything easier than 5.7 while staying anywhere near the ridge). Most of the route is cl. 4 to low 5th and is conducive to simul-climbing or soloing. The crux is the final 600&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153; or so climb directly to the summit.\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;h2&gt;\r\n&lt;a name=\"TOC-The-Plan\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;The Plan&lt;/h2&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;table&gt;\r\n&lt;tbody&gt;\r\n&lt;tr&gt;\r\n&lt;td&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-87uPatHuZ9k/T35jJtrGrjI/AAAAAAABA1I/EJO181ZMbeI/s2000/Lone%2520Pine%2520Peak%2520-%2520Complete%2520North%2520Ridge%2520Topo%2520Map.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-87uPatHuZ9k/T35jJtrGrjI/AAAAAAABA1I/EJO181ZMbeI/s640/Lone%2520Pine%2520Peak%2520-%2520Complete%2520North%2520Ridge%2520Topo%2520Map.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;/td&gt;\r\n&lt;/tr&gt;\r\n&lt;tr&gt;\r\n&lt;td&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;Topo map of our planned climb on the N Ridge of Lone Pine Peak&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;/td&gt;\r\n&lt;/tr&gt;\r\n&lt;/tbody&gt;\r\n&lt;/table&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\nStefan and I planned to climb the CNRoLPP in one continuous push from the valley floor. We each brought along about 3.5 liters of water and about 1,400 calories of snacks for the day (including breakfast). A bike was left hidden at the Meyson Lakes TH so that one of us could ride back down to the valley to fetch the car at the end of the climb. With forecast nighttime lows in the mid-20s and the likelihood of snow on the route from an early-season snow storm, we brought light gloves, puffy jackets and mid-weight boots. \r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\nAlthough the lower section of the ridge was terra incognita for us, we assumed it would mostly be 3rd class and fine to solo, so we planned to start at 5am, ideally reach the Notch by Noon at the latest, and solo or simul-climb most of the route. The descent looked to be straightforward according to the guidebooks and what we could find online, so we expected to descend in the dark on a straightforward route. \r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;h2&gt;\r\n&lt;a name=\"TOC-Hour-0-5:30-am-5.900---Start\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Hour 0 (5:30 am, 5.900&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;) - Start&lt;/h2&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;table&gt;\r\n&lt;tbody&gt;\r\n&lt;tr&gt;\r\n&lt;td&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://lh6.ggpht.com/-wQ_fAG3umh4/T309YPZ4ebI/AAAAAAABAu4/P7faXOgbD7E/s2000/2011-10-21%252520-%25252002a%252520-%252520LPP%252520from%252520Alabama%252520Hills.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"http://lh6.ggpht.com/-wQ_fAG3umh4/T309YPZ4ebI/AAAAAAABAu4/P7faXOgbD7E/s640/2011-10-21%252520-%25252002a%252520-%252520LPP%252520from%252520Alabama%252520Hills.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;/td&gt;\r\n&lt;/tr&gt;\r\n&lt;tr&gt;\r\n&lt;td&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;Lone Pine Peak seen from the Alabama Hills at night.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;/td&gt;\r\n&lt;/tr&gt;\r\n&lt;/tbody&gt;\r\n&lt;/table&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\nWe slept out in the Alabama Hills, where I couldn&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;t resist taking some night photos.

So we had to drop down about 100&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;, round a corner and then lose another 100&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153; or so as we traversed across some of the chutes before heading back up. \r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\nAs we neared the ridge we ended up out on a tapering ledge. Here Stefan chose to drop down about 50 ft or so and then climb back up to the ridge crest. To maintain a more direct line, I attempted to continue on the ledge as it tapered out into slab climbing but quickly found myself in 5th class terrain.

He started part way up and and then backed down, as things were finally difficult enough to need rock shoes. Fortunately the rock here was dry!\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\nStefan put me on belay and I stemmed up a corner (about 5.5) and then traversed a ways on a slab with a thin undercling and around the corner (5.5). Still no pitons . . .\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;table&gt;\r\n&lt;tbody&gt;\r\n&lt;tr&gt;\r\n&lt;td&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://lh6.ggpht.com/-EgFrLccGkqA/TqZ-UMlXUqI/AAAAAAAA2Wc/OlvmKphGDPU/s2000/2011-10-22%252520-%25252043%252520-%2525205_5%252520my%252520butt%252520on%2525203rd%252520Tower.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"http://lh6.ggpht.com/-EgFrLccGkqA/TqZ-UMlXUqI/AAAAAAAA2Wc/OlvmKphGDPU/s640/2011-10-22%252520-%25252043%252520-%2525205_5%252520my%252520butt%252520on%2525203rd%252520Tower.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;/td&gt;\r\n&lt;/tr&gt;\r\n&lt;tr&gt;\r\n&lt;td&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;This next bit was a bit roofy. Felt to me like 5.6-5.7 even in rock shoes. Then it got dark and it was even harder to tell where we were going.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;/td&gt;\r\n&lt;/tr&gt;\r\n&lt;/tbody&gt;\r\n&lt;/table&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\nThe next corner was my lead. Here the route continued up steeply in a corner, with a small roof to surmount (5.6 or 5.7). Rope drag wore me down after the roof so I stopped a little short, perhaps halfway up the Third Tower, and belayed Stefan up to me as the sun set.\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;h2&gt;\r\n&lt;a name=\"TOC-Hour-13-6:30-pm-ca.-12-400---Darkness\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Hour 13 (6:30 pm, ca. 12,400&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;) - Darkness&lt;/h2&gt;\r\n\r\nAs the sun set, Stefan and I discussed our predicament. We still had a long ways to go to get to the summit and we were having trouble route finding even in the daylight. However, it was supposed to get well below freezing that night and we had nothing more than light gloves and a puffy jacket each, so bivvying would be VERY cold. Climbing would keep us warmer, so we decided to take our chances with getting lost in the dark, and kept going.\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\nStefan led out heading right from the ledge, and up another corner and eventually on to some sort of outside corner. I swung leads, continuing up the corner, then into a chute until rope drag stopped me somewhere just shy of the top. Stefan led off again, over the top of the Third Tower and along the ridge, at which point we simul-climbed until we reached the final headwall, perhaps over about 4 pitches&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153; worth of climbing.\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\nOur route description stated there was 6-8 pitches of 4th and easy 5th class climbing directly to the summit register, so we expected to be past the crux of the climb by this point, and perhaps on terrain that we could quickly simul to the summit. These hopes were dashed as we reached the base of the headwall only to see a formidably steep &amp;amp; blank wall rising above, with massive routes overhead. Stefan tried traversing a bit to the right, where things quickly became very exposed and the going did not look feasible. There was a crack and what looked like lower angle terrain to the left, so we committed and chose that way.\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\nWe scrambled down left, wallowed through unconsolidated snow. Keep in mind that we were wearing rock shoes at this point, so this was VERY cold! Stefan led up the thin finger crack and disappeared around the corner. After what seemed like a very long time in the darkness, he pulled up slack and I followed. The crack felt pretty hard since by that time my hands &amp;amp; feet were numb from the snow and my muscles were rigid from the cold. I went around the corner, and then had to downclimb a ways and around the corner. Rope drag had stopped Stefan.\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\nThe rest of the night was a bit of a blur, although it seemed to never end. Each pitch seemed to be the same as the last: climb up an awkward chimney or OW, usually with sketchy or non-existent pro, often scraping out snow to find holds inside or pro placements. Reach the top, traverse around to avoid roofs, get cliffed out, downclimb until you have nearly reached your old altitude, and then around a corner and  traverse to the base of the next chimney/OW, at which point rope drag becomes unmanageable and you have to stop. Make sure to climb through and stand in plenty of snow during this so that your fingers burn and your feet stay semi-numbed. Repeat ad infinitum. \r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\nI have no idea where our line went that night. All I know is that we were somewhere to the left of the crest, and the climbing seemed harder than easy 5th! Most of the wide pitches seemed harder than our crux pitches on the Third Tower. Rope drag kept pitches to about half a rope length, and between the wind, taught rope &amp;amp; being around corners, we could not communicate with each other, which cost us a lot of time. On several occasions I couldn&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;t tell when I had hauled up slack to Stefan or if the rope caught up. I got in the habit of throwing together a Z-C system off the anchor with klemheist knots tied from climbing slings to haul through the rope drag.\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\nAlthough climbing may have kept us somewhat warmer than finding a nice hole in the rock to bivy in, I&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;m not sure exactly how much warmer we were, as I was very cold climbing through the snow with my thin gloves and climbing shoes, and standing in the snow at belays in the wind, usually half-hanging.\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;h2&gt;\r\n&lt;a name=\"TOC-Hour-26-7:12-am-12-900---Sunrise\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Hour 26 (7:12 am, 12,900&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;) - Sunrise&lt;/h2&gt;\r\n \r\n\r\nTime flies when you\'re having fun. Somehow we still hadn\'t gotten much done.\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\nAt long last the earliest morning glow was starting to light things, and we were surprised to see where we were. The terrain dropped off steeply on all sides, and even in daylight we couldn&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;t see where to go. We also had no idea where we were on the face. I stemmed up another corner, humped up over a ledge, and was blocked by another wall &amp;amp; roof. I managed to thread through a gap further west and finally ended up in a large alcove of cl. 3 blocks beneath - another large roof! I saw a cut in the roof and figured we should be able to break through around the corner in that. Rope drag stopped me about 100 ft short of the top.\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;table&gt;\r\n&lt;tbody&gt;\r\n&lt;tr&gt;\r\n&lt;td&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://lh3.ggpht.com/-xGHCKyAIpAQ/TqZ-U5KlDDI/AAAAAAAA2Wg/MHQL9Uo6-2Y/s2000/2011-10-23%252520-%25252001%252520-%252520Looking%252520down%252520on%252520NRoLPP%252520at%252520sunrise.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"http://lh3.ggpht.com/-xGHCKyAIpAQ/TqZ-U5KlDDI/AAAAAAAA2Wg/MHQL9Uo6-2Y/s640/2011-10-23%252520-%25252001%252520-%252520Looking%252520down%252520on%252520NRoLPP%252520at%252520sunrise.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;/td&gt;\r\n&lt;/tr&gt;\r\n&lt;tr&gt;\r\n&lt;td&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;Sunrise 100 ft short of the summit.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;/td&gt;\r\n&lt;/tr&gt;\r\n&lt;/tbody&gt;\r\n&lt;/table&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\nAt least the terrain was easier, it was getting lighter &amp;amp; warmer, and I was sure that the top was finally the top! Stefan climbed up to &amp;amp; past me and was soon on the summit, basking in the morning alpenglow.\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;table&gt;\r\n&lt;tbody&gt;\r\n&lt;tr&gt;\r\n&lt;td&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://lh6.ggpht.com/-4t0_lH-Lzu8/TqZ-V8ugk_I/AAAAAAAA2Wo/KAO3TBBP9oA/s2000/2011-10-23%252520-%25252002a%252520-%252520Whitney%252520in%252520alpenglow%252520from%252520LPP%252520summit.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"http://lh6.ggpht.com/-4t0_lH-Lzu8/TqZ-V8ugk_I/AAAAAAAA2Wo/KAO3TBBP9oA/s640/2011-10-23%252520-%25252002a%252520-%252520Whitney%252520in%252520alpenglow%252520from%252520LPP%252520summit.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;/td&gt;\r\n&lt;/tr&gt;\r\n&lt;tr&gt;\r\n&lt;td&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;Sunrise 100\' short of the summit.

I\'d like to traverse this someday. I\'ve traversed the two right summits (Le Conte &amp;amp; Corcoran). This is between Tuttle Creek &amp;amp; Meyson Lake.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;/td&gt;\r\n&lt;/tr&gt;\r\n&lt;/tbody&gt;\r\n&lt;/table&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\nAt last! We were on the summit. The way down should be easy, mindless walking and we&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;d be back at the car before we knew it. Stefan and I were both exhausted from the long, cold night and were feeling the effects of our water &amp;amp; calorie deficits. We nibbled the last of our food and relaxed in the sun until we stopped shivering and our pant legs dried out.\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\nSo we started plodding down the sand &amp;amp; scree from the summit, relieved that our epic was nearly over and now all we had was a class 2-3 descent down the Northwest Slope and then a straightforward hike out.\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;h2&gt;\r\n&lt;a name=\"TOC-Hour-27.5---Descent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Hour 27.5 - Descent&lt;/h2&gt;\r\n\r\nOur bad . . .\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;table&gt;\r\n&lt;tbody&gt;\r\n&lt;tr&gt;\r\n&lt;td&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-0h88xz04mVc/T31kHGOr9GI/AAAAAAABAyg/-OCuHKS9Fvo/s2000/Lone%2520Pine%2520Pk%2520Descent.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-0h88xz04mVc/T31kHGOr9GI/AAAAAAABAyg/-OCuHKS9Fvo/s640/Lone%2520Pine%2520Pk%2520Descent.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;/td&gt;\r\n&lt;/tr&gt;\r\n&lt;tr&gt;\r\n&lt;td&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;An overview of where I spent the next 10 hours&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;/td&gt;\r\n&lt;/tr&gt;\r\n&lt;/tbody&gt;\r\n&lt;/table&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\nSo in our defense, the Northwest Slope is one of those lines that is easy to follow when ascending, but is trick to find from above if you&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;ve never been up it. Also, some of my info called it class 2 TO 3, so we were willing to accept a little bit of class 3 downclimbing. The sucker chute just before the correct chute looks reasonable and only cliffs out about 100-200 ft before the end, after you have down climbed about 900 ft of cl. 2-3 terrain. The route info also indicates that you take a turn down a chute at the low point in the ridge linking LPP to the Sierra crest, just before the ridge starts rising again.\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\nSo we made good time plodding down the climber&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;s trail. As we neared the low point in the ridge, the trail traversed off to the right as it descended. Just before a patch of snow and a small rise on the right, the trail made a hard right turn towards a small notch formed by this rise. We noted that the trail was a bit more feint here, and the terrain dropped off more steeply than expected. We walked back up and didn&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;t see the climbers trail heading anywhere else, so we figured the steps weren&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;t preserved as well lower down, and after looking closer found a reasonably class 3 (but exposed) downclimb into the chutes, which appeared to descend all the way to the lakes below.\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;table&gt;\r\n&lt;tbody&gt;\r\n&lt;tr&gt;\r\n&lt;td&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://lh5.ggpht.com/-Ue0c0sTiYD0/TqZ-ZU19pXI/AAAAAAAA2W8/u3hUFz5OyLY/s2000/2011-10-23%252520-%25252007%252520-%252520Whitney%252520Massif.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"http://lh5.ggpht.com/-Ue0c0sTiYD0/TqZ-ZU19pXI/AAAAAAAA2W8/u3hUFz5OyLY/s640/2011-10-23%252520-%25252007%252520-%252520Whitney%252520Massif.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;/td&gt;\r\n&lt;/tr&gt;\r\n&lt;tr&gt;\r\n&lt;td&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;The Mt Whitney massif. Mt Muir is the left-most Pk and is counted as a separate 14er, yet none of the other +14000\' spires on the ridge are. Hmmm . . . &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;/td&gt;\r\n&lt;/tr&gt;\r\n&lt;/tbody&gt;\r\n&lt;/table&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\nThere was a lot of snow on these shaded northern aspects, so we treaded lightly and tried to find the driest chute to descend, so at first we traversed skier\'s left. Downclimbing the mixed snow, scree &amp;amp; slab was precarious at times, but we lost elevation fast and were nearly at the lakes when the terrain dropped away below us!\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\nStefan and I were really dragging by this time, so we climbed slowly back up the chute to try to find another way down. We found another chute, capped with another cliff at the bottom. I started traversing on a ledge system over to the next chute, hoping that maybe it was more reasonable. Stefan, however, kept traversing along the edge of the cliff. \r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\n&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#156;I&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;m going to keep climbing down this way. It looks like it might go,&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#157; Stefan said.\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\nI still didn&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;t like the look of it, and knowing that it was definitely off-route, I was not up for soloing down unknown 5th class terrain.\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\n&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#156;Stefan, I don&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;t know about forcing our way down that line. I&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;m going to take a look around this corner first. Don&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;t go too far away&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#157;, I replied. I spent maybe 15-20 minutes rounding the corner, doing some very insecure downclimbing on powder snow covered rocks until I got cliffed out again. This cliff, however, looked like it could be rappelled with one rope and then was clear the rest of the way down.\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\nI headed back over to where I last saw Stefan. He wasn&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;t there. I shouted for him and there was no response. I ventured right up to the edge of the cliff and shouted down. There was no sign of him. It appeared to me that Stefan had continued down - with the rope.\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;h2&gt;\r\n&lt;a name=\"TOC-Hours-30-to-35---Alone\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Hours 30 to 35 - Alone&lt;/h2&gt;\r\n\r\nThe uncertainty of completely leaving the area where I had last seen Stefan, and the extremely unpleasant prospect of climbing all the way back up to the plateau to start over again led me to go slightly insane: I started doing the same thing over and over again hoping for a different result. I would re-read the printouts of the route descent descriptions, trying to make sense of where we had gone wrong. Everything seemed to match, and yet not. I climbed back up a ways, traversed over, and climbed down another chute, only to be cliffed out. I did this several times, climbing up and down several hundred feet of mixed rock &amp;amp; snow for each attempt.\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;table&gt;\r\n&lt;tbody&gt;\r\n&lt;tr&gt;\r\n&lt;td&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://lh6.ggpht.com/-1fEBZ-cnuGY/TqZ-YCfLNgI/AAAAAAAA2W0/zGAqEhT46zE/s2000/2011-10-23%252520-%25252005%252520-%252520Irvine%252520Pk.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"http://lh6.ggpht.com/-1fEBZ-cnuGY/TqZ-YCfLNgI/AAAAAAAA2W0/zGAqEhT46zE/s640/2011-10-23%252520-%25252005%252520-%252520Irvine%252520Pk.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;/td&gt;\r\n&lt;/tr&gt;\r\n&lt;tr&gt;\r\n&lt;td&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;The nice N Buttress of Mt Irvine (5.9ish I think)&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;/td&gt;\r\n&lt;/tr&gt;\r\n&lt;/tbody&gt;\r\n&lt;/table&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\nI was feeling so tired I wanted to sleep. I was so thirsty that I started sucking on snow to help alleviate my cottonmouth. I was feeling mindless in the way I normally do when I&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;ve bonked. And the sun was getting awfully far to the west in the sky. Had I really spend most of the day here? \r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\nI REALLY wanted to get out of here. I knew that I would likely have phone reception here, and I knew of some people who had done the descent, so I swallowed my pride and called out for a &amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#156;Lifeline&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#157; for some hints.\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\nIt turned out that I didn&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;t have the cell numbers of most of the people who I knew had been on the route. I did know one person, my friend Dirk, so I gave him a ring. After an awkward greeting and explaining that I was lost and exhausted on the side of the mountain with darkness approaching, Dirk gave me the comforting beta from his descent experience after climbing the NRoLPP:\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\n&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#156;We ended up getting cliffed out in a maze of chutes. Since it was late in the day we had to bivy and rappel out the next day.&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#157;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\nDoh!\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\nDirk offered to get me the numbers for Whitney Portal and the Lone Pine ranger station since it was likely someone there knew the route. While I waited for the call back, I continued looking for a way out.\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\nThings suddenly started seeming promising as I was finding a good ledge system that was cutting across all of the chutes that I had explored earlier. I was wrapping around a corner and could see what looked like possibly a lower angle scree chute to the west. Below me the chutes cliffed out and I started finding rappel anchors. If only I had the rope! I started encountering small sections of 5th class, but fortunately the rock was dry. Since the chute looked close, I figured it was worth pressing into this terrain. \r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;table&gt;\r\n&lt;tbody&gt;\r\n&lt;tr&gt;\r\n&lt;td&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://lh3.ggpht.com/-prjpdNOPFC4/TqZ-aJz8RMI/AAAAAAAA2XA/JYcrDVhZkhA/s2000/2011-10-23%252520-%25252008%252520-%252520Sketchy%252520Rapp%252520Anchor.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"http://lh3.ggpht.com/-prjpdNOPFC4/TqZ-aJz8RMI/AAAAAAAA2XA/JYcrDVhZkhA/s640/2011-10-23%252520-%25252008%252520-%252520Sketchy%252520Rapp%252520Anchor.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;/td&gt;\r\n&lt;/tr&gt;\r\n&lt;tr&gt;\r\n&lt;td&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;Not a rapp anchor I\'d use! A little sketchy. I like how they wedged some stones in the crack to help keep the nut in place. I was having trouble finding my way down by this time.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;/td&gt;\r\n&lt;/tr&gt;\r\n&lt;/tbody&gt;\r\n&lt;/table&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\nSame as before, I was cliffed out on all sides and had to reverse all of my work. In this daze of exploration I saw a large, brightly colored lump in the cliffs. Could this be a hallucination? Or did someone leave a climbing pack up there? I scrambled up through some 4th class to claim my prize - a gigantic popped squid balloon. Not quite what I was wanting, but being a good steward, I filled up about half of my pack with it to pack out. (Later on when I unfolded it, I think it was actually a flower . .. maybe?)\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\nBy this time Dirk had given me the numbers. I had already grudgingly called Whitney Portal, and the number turned out to be for some sort of hostel. I held out.\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;h2&gt;\r\n&lt;a name=\"TOC-Hour-35-37---Escape\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Hour 35-37 - Escape&lt;/h2&gt;\r\n  \r\n\r\nFinally, as the sun was nearing the horizon,  I called the ranger station.\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\n&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#156;This is the Inyo County Lone Pine ranger station,&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#157; a woman replied.\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\n&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#156;Excuse me, but I&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;m having a hard time finding my way down the standard route on Lone Pine Peak. I&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;m getting pretty tired here and would really like to figure out where I&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;ve gone wrong with my descent before it gets dark. Would there happen to be anyone in the station familiar with the route?&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#157; I inquired.\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\n&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#156;Hahaha, no! Heheheh -&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#157; CLICK.\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\nGRRRRRRR!!!\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\nI hung up on the ranger. That&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;s it! At last I had finally given up on these stupid chutes and spent the next half hour or so climbing all the way back up to the plateau.  Sure enough, we had taken the worn trail down, which made a sharp turn at the snow patch. There were no prints in the snow so I walked back up the trail a ways, slowly, looking for any sign of a branching trail. There was none, so I walked down, looking carefully again. Still nothing.\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\nOnce I reached the snow patch I looked beyond it. I thought I saw a faint footprint there, so I headed roughly on that line to the left of the little highpoint to see what was over there. At first the slope dropped away the same as before, but as I approached the drop off I saw that it rounded into a short little headwall and then a straightforward class 2 chute the rest of the way down!\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\nI booked it down the chute and was quenching my thirst at the lakes just before sunset.\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;h2&gt;\r\n&lt;a name=\"TOC-Hours-37-39-8:30-pm---Meyson-Lakes-Trailhead\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Hours 37-39 (8:30 pm) - Meyson Lakes Trailhead&lt;/h2&gt;\r\n\r\nI moved as fast as I could to find the trail. A misadventure through a muddy bog left me wet from the knees down, and I had a little bit of class 3 scrambling through some ledges to find the trail, but soon I was on easy street. I hiked out as fast as my rebuilt ACL would allow, hoping to maximize my trail distance before darkness slowed me down.\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\nI called Stefan&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;s number and left a message telling him my time, location, and ETA. Soon after he called back to report that he had picked up the car via the bike shuttle and was waiting at the trailhead. Apparently he had found a 5.6 chimney that he had downclimbed to get out hours earlier. Well, at least he got the extra work of biking back to the car :-P\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\nMy time estimate was a bit off, and as it got dark I began to hallucinate (by this criteria this climb was rated amongst the top 4 most exhausting climbs I have ever done). I saw lights moving ahead of me on the trail, and at times they appeared to be moving towards me, and at times away. Was I catching up on someone? Were they on switchbacks below me? I couldn&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;t tell. Every now and then I swore that I could hear the faint sound of music echoing through the trees and sometimes, a light below. I&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;m pretty sure based on the topo map that there were no cabins in the Meyson Lakes fork out of Whitney Portal, so I think I badly needed my Orange Fanta soda and dinner.\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\nSo I enjoyed the entertainment as I huffed it back to the luxuries of shoeless lounging and a long awaited meal. Maybe next year I\'ll look back on this experience more fondly and try the longer NERoLPP?\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;table&gt;\r\n&lt;tbody&gt;\r\n&lt;tr&gt;\r\n&lt;td&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://lh5.ggpht.com/-IR-drak7cHw/T3i5_rxyTuI/AAAAAAABAVI/bNe8E1vA4XM/s2000/2011-11-04%252520-%252520Balloon%252520at%252520%252520New%252520Home.JPG\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"http://lh5.ggpht.com/-IR-drak7cHw/T3i5_rxyTuI/AAAAAAABAVI/bNe8E1vA4XM/s640/2011-11-04%252520-%252520Balloon%252520at%252520%252520New%252520Home.JPG\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;/td&gt;\r\n&lt;/tr&gt;\r\n&lt;tr&gt;\r\n&lt;td&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;The balloon in its new home.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;/td&gt;\r\n&lt;/tr&gt;\r\n&lt;/tbody&gt;\r\n&lt;/table&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;hr&gt;\r\n&lt;hr&gt;\r\n&lt;h2&gt;\r\n&lt;a name=\"TOC-Notes\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Notes&lt;/h2&gt;\r\n\r\nBelow the notch of the standard route, the route is mostly class 2-3, with occasional class 4-5 bits that could potentially be bypassed with more tortuous wandering. Nice bivy spots abound on the lower ridge, but if you plan to do this route in a day, make sure to move fast or start extra early. You really can do most of the lower ridge in the dark with little concern for routefinding in the dark as long as you&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;re willing to charge up 4th to low 5th class on occasionally gritty rock.\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\nI had climbed the East Face of Mt Whitney car-to-car the weekend before and this climb was MUCH harder, technically. It really is a solid 5.7, or Whitney&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;s East Face is more like 5.6, or our route was just plain bad :-P\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\nThere are a few easy things to consider to make sure you take the right descent:\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\n1. If you have to scramble down ANYTHING 3rd class, you are descending too soon.\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\n2. If you are gaining elevation again as you traverse the summit plateau, you have gone too far.\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\n3. If you can mostly scree ski the route and it isn\'t even close to class 3, then you are taking the right chute.\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\nHaving these 3 points spelled out for me would have saved many hours of exploring all of the chutes NOT to take down! Pt. #2 was apparent to me, but 1 &amp;amp; 3 would have saved a lot of grief.                            \r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;hr&gt;\r\n&lt;hr&gt;\r\n&lt;h2&gt;\r\n&lt;a name=\"TOC-Links\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Links&lt;/h2&gt;\r\n&lt;ul&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"https://picasaweb.google.com/105894936663116565516/20111022to23CNRoLPPV57?authuser=0&amp;amp;feat=directlink\"&gt;Full photo album on Picasa&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://picasaweb.google.com/105894936663116565516/20111022to23CNRoLPPV57?authuser=0&amp;amp;feat=directlink\"&gt;SuperTopo TR&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;/ul&gt;\r\n&lt;/div&gt; \r\n'),(73,43,'/mountaineering/trip-reports/california/north-arete-of-matterhorn-peak','Matterhorn Pk (N Arete)','North Arete of Matterhorn Peak','Trip_Report','content: &lt;div dir=\"ltr\"&gt;\r\n&lt;h1&gt;\r\n&lt;a name=\"TOC-North-Arete-of-Matterhorn-Peak\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;North Arete of Matterhorn Peak\r\n\r\n\r\n&lt;/h1&gt;\r\n&lt;h2&gt;\r\n&lt;a name=\"TOC-Aug-6-8-2004\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Aug 6-8, 2004&lt;/h2&gt;\r\n&lt;hr&gt;\r\n&lt;hr&gt;\r\n&lt;table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"2\" cellspacing=\"1\"&gt;\r\n&lt;tbody&gt;\r\n&lt;tr&gt;\r\n&lt;td width=\"45%\"&gt;\r\n&lt;ul&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;Routes:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href=\"http://www.summitpost.org/show/route_link.pl/route_id/192/object_id/352\"&gt;North Arete&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"http://www.summitpost.org/show/route_link.pl/route_id/1222/object_id/352\"&gt;East Couloir&lt;/a&gt;\r\n&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;Elevation Gained:&lt;/b&gt; 5,187&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;  \r\n&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;RT Distance:&lt;/b&gt; TBD  \r\n&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;RT Time:&lt;/b&gt; 3 Days (Aug 6th-8th)  \r\n&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;Trailhead:&lt;/b&gt; Horse Creek @ Twin Lakes  \r\n&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;TH Elevation:&lt;/b&gt; 7,092&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;  \r\n&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;Summit Elevation:&lt;/b&gt; 12,279&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;  \r\n&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;Rating:&lt;/b&gt; III, 5.6  \r\n&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;Climbers:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href=\"http://www.summitpost.org/mountains/user_link.pl?user_id=13451\"&gt;Mark Thomas&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"http://www.summitpost.org/mountains/user_link.pl?user_id=583\"&gt;Dirk Summers&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"http://www.summitpost.org/mountains/user_link.pl?user_id=462\"&gt;Gordon Ye&lt;/a&gt;\r\n&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;/ul&gt;\r\n&lt;/td&gt;\r\n&lt;td width=\"55%\"&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-QSs8myOVh98/UPjag9BNXtI/AAAAAAABocs/bYE0znBdckA/s2000/71685.JPG\"&gt;&lt;img height=\"250\" src=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-QSs8myOVh98/UPjag9BNXtI/AAAAAAABocs/bYE0znBdckA/s650/71685.JPG\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;/td&gt;\r\n&lt;/tr&gt;\r\n&lt;/tbody&gt;\r\n&lt;/table&gt;\r\n&lt;hr&gt;\r\n&lt;hr&gt;\r\n&lt;h2&gt;\r\n&lt;a name=\"TOC-Aug-6-2004\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Aug 6, 2004&lt;/h2&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;It was a clear sunny day when Dirk, Gordon, and I left our campsite at Mammoth and headed north to Bridgeport.  We were still a little groggy from having been up late the night before.  Dirk and Gordon had driven over last night from the Bay Area after work. I had just finished my final day of the &lt;a href=\"http://www.markpthomas.com/mountaineering/trip-reports/california/mt-jepson-palisade-crest\"&gt;2004 Sierra Challenge&lt;/a&gt;, and Heyning Cheng was nice enough to drive me up from Big Pine to a diner in Bishop to wait for them. They arrived a little after midnight, and we went to sleep sometime around 2am.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;div style=\"text-align:center\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-pfgkD0bmuBE/UPjacwCzDCI/AAAAAAABocE/nA7l456DRDA/s2000/63342.JPG\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-pfgkD0bmuBE/UPjacwCzDCI/AAAAAAABocE/nA7l456DRDA/s800/63342.JPG\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;\r\n&lt;div style=\"text-align:center\"&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Sawtooth Range seen from Highway 395&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;\r\n&lt;/div&gt;\r\n&lt;/b&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n  After securing the necessary camping permit (which was a first for me and Dirk), we headed to the Twin Lakes Resort.  The rocky palisade of Sawtooth Ridge jutted up in stark contrast to the rolling foothills and flat fertile farmlands that we passed through on HWY 395.  Dirk and Gordon had come here to climb the North Arete of Matterhorn Pk, and they had talked me into leaving the Sierra Challenge early to join them on the climb.  From below we could barely make out Matterhorn Pk on the ridge &amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#147; it didn&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;t stand out much from the ridge, but it looked impressive.  \r\n  &lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;div style=\"text-align:center\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-NYmMn7qL7rY/UPjahoJ-94I/AAAAAAABoc0/DDfoI_nwjGQ/s2000/66742.JPG\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-NYmMn7qL7rY/UPjahoJ-94I/AAAAAAABoc0/DDfoI_nwjGQ/s800/66742.JPG\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;\r\n&lt;div style=\"text-align:center\"&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Matterhorn Peak from the valley&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;\r\n&lt;/div&gt;\r\n&lt;/b&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n  After parking at the Twin Lakes boat launch and getting our gear in order, we strapped on our heavy packs and started up the trail as it switch backed up the steep open slopes below the mouth of Horse Creek Canyon.  The trail was hot and dusty, but the views of Twin Lakes receding far below made the trail a nice hike.  We set a fairly moderate pace, and although I was carrying a lot more weight than on the Sierra Challenge, the slower pace kept the hiking easy for me.  \r\n  &lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;div style=\"text-align:center\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-s4N-TrKUV4g/UPjaeDRCJMI/AAAAAAABocU/q9yb9EPzX38/s2000/65194.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-s4N-TrKUV4g/UPjaeDRCJMI/AAAAAAABocU/q9yb9EPzX38/s800/65194.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;\r\n&lt;div style=\"text-align:center\"&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Swimmers at Matterhorn Lake&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;\r\n&lt;/div&gt;\r\n&lt;/b&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\nAs the trail passed the headwall to Horse Creek Canyon, it followed a short ways away from Horse Creek, occasionally shaded by old growth pines. At 8,200&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153; we reached a switchback on the main trail &amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#147; from here it would be cross-country the rest of the way to our camp.  The use-trail travel was nice at first as it passed through a clearing, but soon the going got tough. Thick bushes crowded in, covering the large boulders that the trail passed over. There seemed to be several trails one could take, and this just added to the confusion on where to go.    The brush was slow going since the bushes made it hard to see where to step and the branches snagged our packs, but soon we were through the brush &amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#147; now all that lay before us was a 1,200 ft climb straight up a loose talus slope.  \r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\nDirk and Gordon slowed down as we reached the steep slope, but I sped on. My legs were built for powering up steep slopes, and since it was hot, sunny, and there was no good place to sit down, I just wanted to get the hill over with.  After about 800 ft of climbing I found a flat spot with some sparse shade and dropped my pack to wait for the others.  I saw Dirk and Gordon slowing up down below and hollered to them about finding a nice place for lunch. This seemed to give them the motivation to push on a bit longer and soon we were enjoying a nice lunch break as we enjoyed a wonderful view of Horse Creek Canyon.  \r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\nAfter lunch we continued on up the steep slope &amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#147; luckily the ground was more solid at this point and there were more trees providing shade.  Dirk and I stayed together as we picked our way through some cliff bands before heading up the final steep slope.  We reached a saddle at 9,200 ft and were rewarded with a view of a beautifully green-blue alpine lake.  It was a few hundred feet across and surrounded by steep granite cliffs &amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#147; the lake seemed to have bored down into the bedrock.  There were some other hikers enjoying the lake below, and we left our packs to go join them.  \r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\nThe hikers had climbed Matterhorn Pk via the East Couloir and were heading down that day.  Across the lake was a tent and a pair of hermetic climbers who were intending on climbing the North Arete the next day (we talked with them once on the whole trip since they stayed in their tent the whole time!).  Gordon happily plopped his pack down on the side of the lake just as Dirk and I decided to go for a swim. While we had been waiting for Gordon we tried to photograph a little frog in the lake and found the water to be warm enough for swimming.  Dirk foiled my last attempt to photograph the frog as he dove into the lake. I stripped down and followed.  I got used to the water fast, but my feet froze when I let them dangle too far down.  We tried to coax Gordon into going for a swim, but he declined, content to just relax and enjoy the view.  There was a large flat grassy spot atop a ledge on the south side of the lake, but the open meadow to the west was more inviting, so after our swim, we set up camp on the other side of a large boulder about 100 ft away from the other climbers.  \r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\nWhile I got my tent set up and gear organized, Dirk took off to try some bouldering traverses above the lake. He called insisted that Gordon and I try the traverse, but both of us were feeling rather lazy by then and just relaxed around camp, enjoying our full view of Matterhorn Pk further up the canyon. This was one of the best campsites I had been to in the Sierras, and although the approach was quite trying, it was well worth it to get here. Dirk explored the cliffs to the west of our camp, climbing up a large chimney and disappearing over the horizon to catch the sunset.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;h2&gt;\r\n&lt;a name=\"TOC-Aug-7-2004\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Aug 7, 2004&lt;/h2&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;We woke up before sunrise and headed up the grassy ledges that rose like steps heading south from the lake. The cross-country travel was easy and we were making good time.  Soon the sun rose, and we were awestruck as the alpenglow lit up Matterhon Pk above us like a pillar of fire. Dirk had commented earlier that the peak looked more like a rocket at liftoff than resembling Matterhorn, and when bathed in the hot red glow of the morning sun, it looked even more like a spaceship lifting off. &lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;div style=\"text-align:center\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-t5Lj58T91Tc/UPjaiLuXUpI/AAAAAAABoc8/UCvgPbuAz4s/s2000/66751.JPG\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-t5Lj58T91Tc/UPjaiLuXUpI/AAAAAAABoc8/UCvgPbuAz4s/s800/66751.JPG\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;\r\n&lt;div style=\"text-align:center\"&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Alpenglow on Matterhorn Peak&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;\r\n&lt;/div&gt;\r\n&lt;/b&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n  Soon we were at the loose glacial moraine, and we climbed over a thin part of it on the southeast side of the glacier. As we were putting on our crampons we noticed our campsite companions traversing around the north side of the glacier. The other climbers had woken before us and had gotten about a half-hour head start, but it seemed like now they were wasting a lot of time trying to stay off the glacier and traverse around the steep loose slopes above.  The trailing climber consistently sent rockfall down the slope while her friend coached her on. He had reached some solid cliffs at the head of the glacier, but despite efforts to stay off the glacier, he still had to cross it high up to reach the East Couloir.  We commented on the absurdity of their route and then headed straight up the glacier.  \r\n  &lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;div style=\"text-align:center\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-p-DN_6d6Vrc/UPjaev5bqNI/AAAAAAABocc/LXOXxw14axo/s2000/65196.JPG\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-p-DN_6d6Vrc/UPjaev5bqNI/AAAAAAABocc/LXOXxw14axo/s800/65196.JPG\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;\r\n&lt;div style=\"text-align:center\"&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Morning light on Matterhorn Peak seen from the slab approach&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;\r\n&lt;/div&gt;\r\n&lt;/b&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n  The glacier was heavily sun cupped, making the walking hard at first, but then easier as the slope increased. I headed up and to the right, staying on the glacier as long as I could before transitioning back to rock.  Dirk and Gordon stopped to admire a crevasse and then picked their way to a ridge of loose rock to the left.  I had just reached the top of the glacier and was setting my pack down on a well-protected ledge when Dirk called out to me to come down and join them where they were taking off their crampons.  \r\n  &lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;i&gt;&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#156;Hell no!&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#157;&lt;/i&gt; I shouted back &amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#147; I didn&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;t want to give up my hard earned elevation only to regain it with them. They would have to pass by me anyway, so I insisted on waiting for them were I was. Once they reached me we cached our axes, crampons, and extra water on a ledge, but hid it out of site lest a climber higher up thought that our gear was a fallen body.  \r\n  &lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n  Dirk had been keeping a close eye on the features of the route as we had approached the peak, and he led us a few hundred yards up the East Couloir before finding the start of the North Arete route.  The two other climbers were already on it and their shouts echoed off of the rock walls.  Luckily Gordon had brought some radios along to save us from such awkward communication. \r\n  &lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n  Earlier on we had discussed climbing as high up the route as we felt comfortable before roping up in order to save time, so Dirk headed straight up a steep chimney to reach the first set of ledges. Gordon and I traversed a bit higher to where the climbing was a little easier. Neither of us traversed far along the ridge before the exposure had us calling Dirk back to begin roped climbing.  \r\n  &lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;div style=\"text-align:center\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-W5il1XU62R8/UPjai8SLAgI/AAAAAAABodE/3Wojn4_FKz4/s2000/66743.JPG\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-W5il1XU62R8/UPjai8SLAgI/AAAAAAABodE/3Wojn4_FKz4/s800/66743.JPG\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;\r\n&lt;div style=\"text-align:center\"&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Gordon Ye at the base of the route.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;\r\n&lt;/div&gt;\r\n&lt;/b&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n  I gave Gordon the rope as Dirk set up and anchor and climbed back to us. He belayed Gordon first and then brought the rope back to me.  The beginning climbing was very easy and there were portions were we climbed unroped. Soon we reached a large notch as we gained the ridge proper, and the real climbing began.  \r\n  &lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n  Since there were three of us climbing, this required a bit more rope-handling and communication, and Dirk had figured out a nice way to get three climbers up the route.  Besides having the radios for communication, we also had a 60m long 5mm thick cord. The idea was that the second would tie this to his harness and trail it behind. Once at the next belay station, the second would tie the climbing rope to the cord and the third could pull the end of the climbing rope back down to tie in to.  Luckily we didn&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;t have to fiddle with this system too much because the climbing wound around so many obstacles and there were enough good ledges that rope drag encouraged us to climb in half-pitches. I had distances marked out on my rope, so we let Dirk know on the radio when he would need to set up an anchor. Gordon would tie into the middle of the rope and re-clip the rope as he passed pro. Then I followed and cleaned up the pitch.  \r\n  &lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;div style=\"text-align:center\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-O3BNyCZ3buA/UPjajWSXktI/AAAAAAABodM/uslNbddriz0/s2000/66746.JPG\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-O3BNyCZ3buA/UPjajWSXktI/AAAAAAABodM/uslNbddriz0/s800/66746.JPG\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;\r\n&lt;div style=\"text-align:center\"&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Double Dihedral route seen from the North Arete&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;\r\n&lt;/div&gt;\r\n&lt;/b&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n  From the notch Dirk led up and right, onto the west side of the Arete. On the next pitch Dirk headed back up to gain the ridge. He had to go further than half the rope length in order to reach the next good belay station. After Gordon followed I had to break down the anchor and climb a ways to give Gordon enough rope to reach the belay.  Luckily the terrain was sheltered, so it was safe to climb on.   \r\n  &lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n  I reached a blank vertical wall with a large crack heading straight up the middle, and I had to climb up about 3 or 4 feet to give Gordon the final distance he needed.  After going on belay, I continued up the crack.  It was very steep and it was easy to get good hand jams. I didn&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;t have to climb high above the ledge before it felt very exposed &amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#147; the terrain dropped away very steeply all around me.  After climbing in the relative protection of the jumbled and rocky ridge, the sudden exposure felt exhilarating. After climbing about 20 ft of crack I reached the top. \r\n  &lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n  Dirk and Gordon were waiting for me just above where the crack turned to face climbing. The belay spot was not very good.  The anchor was built across a small dihedral, with pro on some cracks on the far side, in the corner, and on the near side. The dihedral was canted back at about 70 degrees, and Dirk was belaying by stemming across the dihedral, utilizing a diagonal crack on the right face for a foothold. Gordon had to climb past him and was clinging to the other side. There was no room for me in the dihedral, so I straddled the outside corner and tied in to the anchor.  \r\n  &lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n  The belay setup became more worrisome when Dirk tried to get a better cam in on the far side of the dihedral. As he was fumbling with the cams he &lt;i&gt;dropped&lt;/i&gt; something metallic &amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#147; it fell, bounced once over the edge and out of site, and then no more. Dirk was pissed &amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#147; he had dropped a cam! I felt a little more relieved upon hearing his cursing about the loss, since I was worried that he had dropped the whole carabiner of cams.   \r\n  &lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;div style=\"text-align:center\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-hQ3aLM5wZeo/UPjajxn-0bI/AAAAAAABodU/UJAklaD-yRQ/s2000/65203.JPG\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-hQ3aLM5wZeo/UPjajxn-0bI/AAAAAAABodU/UJAklaD-yRQ/s800/65203.JPG\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;\r\n&lt;div style=\"text-align:center\"&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Dirk leading the fun 5.6/5.7 dihedral and crack pitch.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;\r\n&lt;/div&gt;\r\n&lt;/b&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n  Dirk led up the pitch and stopped after climbing only about 50 ft. He had found a much nicer belay station and declared that it was worth the time to set it up for a more comfortable belay. Then he noticed that his ATC belay device was missing. During the confusion of handling the gear spanning the dihedral he must have dropped it!  I looked around and saw that it was wedged in the corner, about 10 feet below me and about 2 feet from the horizon where the steep dihedral terminated at a steeper cliff. I radioed to Dirk that I had found his belay device and would down climb to retrieve it after Gordon had gone up.  In the meantime Dirk fashioned a belay using a Munter Hitch for Gordon.  \r\n  &lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n  Just after Gordon cleared the dihedral I heard a shout: &lt;i&gt;&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#156;ROCK!&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#157;&lt;/i&gt;  Suddenly a rock about 18 inches across ricocheted down the dihedral. Luckily I was straddling the outside of the chute and was out of harms way, but I was briefly startled as I thought that the rock might smash into the anchor spanning the dihedral, pulling me off of my perch.  \r\n  &lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n  Then I was on belay and climbing down to the ATC. I clipped it on to my harness and radioed to Dirk to belay me climbing up.  \r\n  &lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n  &amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#156;Any chance that you can climb down and get my cam?&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#157; he queried. I looked over the edge and saw nothing but space all the way down to the East Couloir. \r\n  &lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n  &amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#156;No can do,&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#157; I replied. &amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#156;It&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;s long gone.&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#157;  \r\n  &lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n  After I reached Dirk and Gordon we dismantled the belay station since the ledge was large enough to be safe on unroped. We were one pitche away from the top, and at this point the route had two variations: The humongous 5.6 dihedral that is a noticeable part of the left side of the top of the north face; or finishing via the 5.7 direct ar&amp;Atilde;&amp;ordf;te. Dirk wanted to do the ar&amp;Atilde;&amp;ordf;te, but Gordon and I lamely excused ourselves as being too tired to do a harder route than was necessary.  Because of my participation in the Sierra Challenge, and my fast hiking pace that I led with on this trip, Dirk didn&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;t believe me for a second.  In truth I was a little tired from the stressful position of the last belay, and the exposure had also been a little psychologically tiring to me. Also, I really wanted to climb the final dihedral since it looked like a lot of fun. \r\n  &lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n  The final pitch had to be done as a full pitch &amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#147; the first half pitch ascended a crack that was formed by the corner of the massive dihedral. The walls were smooth and the crack varied from less than finger-width to off-width. Above that was a short ledge and then a 20 ft off-width chimney.  I belayed Dirk as he climbed up the crack. It looked like a blast and I was anxious to try it.  This time I seconded, trailing the thin cord beneath me. The final pitch was every bit as fun and interesting as I had hoped.  There were few places where I was able to solely jam in the crack. Usually I was in some combination of a hand and foot jamb, a foot smear, and a hand holding onto a small nub on the side, mostly for balance.  Dirk had left his pack at the off-width chimney to avoid getting it stuck, and he lowered a portion of the rope back down to me to tie onto our packs.  He hauled them up and then I followed. Then we tied the climbing rope to the cord and Gordon easily retrieved the end of the climbing rope.  \r\n  &lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n  The top was rather anti-climatic.  From the photo in Secor&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;s guidebook it appeared as if the route terminated on a very fine pointy summit. In reality the summit was still out of site, another 200 ft away across some class 4 climbing.  To save time Dirk wanted to free-solo the class 4. I looked at the exposure on both sides of the ridge and decided that I&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;d rather not risk falling off of the north face. Just at this time we heard another climber heading up from below. He topped out, but without a rope! He casually declared that he was in his office in Lee Vining that morning and had decided to go for a climb, so he drove up to Twin Lakes, hiked up Horse Creek Canyon, and free-soloed the entire route, just finishing when we were.  He seemed a little cocky, and just like another climber Dirk and I had encountered on the West Ridge of Mt Conness a year earlier, and Dirk was likewise irritated this time as he had been before. I found the situation a little comical.  \r\n  &lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;div style=\"text-align:center\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-9BS6fb6qi8o/UPjafZRJq2I/AAAAAAABock/tvemDeiCyWY/s2000/65197.JPG\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-9BS6fb6qi8o/UPjafZRJq2I/AAAAAAABock/tvemDeiCyWY/s800/65197.JPG\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;\r\n&lt;div style=\"text-align:center\"&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Me traversing to the summit from the top of the North Arete&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;\r\n&lt;/div&gt;\r\n&lt;/b&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n  Dirk had tried unsuccessfully to talk Gordon and me into free-soloing the last part, and now we asked this other climber to report back to us as to what the remainder of the ridge was like. He climbed on and reported that the climbing was easy &amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#147; just don&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;t fall.  Gordon and I won out with our desire to rope up for the last part, so Dirk sent me off on lead.  A scrambled along a ledge with an awkward overhang above it on the left side of the ridge, over some loose rock, and then back up and over the other side of the ridge. By then there was a lot of rope drag, so I set up a light anchor and belayed Gordon over. Dirk decided that he might as well use the belay since it was there, and followed. Dirk led the next pitch, this time up some very sharp knife-edges, and soon we were on the summit.  \r\n  &lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;div style=\"text-align:center\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-TZrzhCehnWE/UPjaddu2lhI/AAAAAAABocM/8fDaP43mt4s/s2000/64565.JPG\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-TZrzhCehnWE/UPjaddu2lhI/AAAAAAABocM/8fDaP43mt4s/s800/64565.JPG\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;\r\n&lt;div style=\"text-align:center\"&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Dirk on the summit&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;\r\n&lt;/div&gt;\r\n&lt;/b&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\nAfter a short celebration and some posing on the summit we picked up and moved on. The plan had been to get down to the car today, and the sun was already setting!  I was having flashbacks to all of my previous climbs with Dirk. &lt;a href=\"http://www.markpthomas.com/mountaineering/trip-reports/california/mark-n-dirk-s-bivouac-trilogy---part-1-mt-conness\"&gt;Mt Conness&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"http://www.markpthomas.com/mountaineering/trip-reports/california/mark-n-dirk-s-bivouac-trilogy---part-2-mt-sill\"&gt;Mt Sill&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"http://www.markpthomas.com/mountaineering/trip-reports/california/mark-n-dirk-s-bivouac-trilogy---part-3-north-palisade-polemonium\"&gt;North Palisade&lt;/a&gt; &amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#147; they all had one repeated theme in our alpine adventures. We would get caught out in the dark and be forced to bivy!  Gordon mentioned that he had never had to bivouac in the mountains yet, so we joked that maybe his good fortune would change the outcome of this trip. Hopefully this time would be different.    \r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\nWe turned on our headlamps just as we reached the top of the East Couloir.  Without snow cover it was quite the &amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#152;poop&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153; chute. The rock was very loose.  We were amazed to be back down at our cache within about 40 minutes &amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#147; the climb had taken HOURS! We strapped on our crampons and quickly headed down the glacier, climbed over the moraine, and continued down the ridge. Then the trouble started.  \r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\nWe were not on the same ridge we had come up. The terrain looked unfamiliar and it seemed like we were on a ridge that we couldn&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;t match up on the topo.  I tried to keep in mind the phenomenon of the terrain seeming larger and having higher relief in the dark than in daylight, so I wasn&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;t too worried.  We occasionally stopped to debate about which way to go. Once we got low enough to hear the creek I knew that we were all right. There was only one stream in the area, feeding from the glacier into the lake by our camp. We were descending below the ridge we had climbed that morning, but if we dropped down to the more level canyon bottom we would be back in no time.  \r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\nThe stream kept us on track and soon we were back at camp. We thanked Gordon for his good karma and then took stock of our situation.  It was now around midnight and we were exhausted. Hiking out in the dark would be very unpleasant, and it would probably be so slow that we wouldn&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;t reach the trailhead until sunrise.  Since Gordon had cell phone reception, he and Dirk called in sick for work and we went to bed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;h2&gt;\r\n&lt;a name=\"TOC-Aug-8-2004\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Aug 8, 2004&lt;/h2&gt;\r\nWe woke up at sunrise and had a nice hike out. Heading downhill was very easy and soon we were back to the bushwhacking in Horse Creek Canyon.  We were back down to the car by noon.  After stopping for lunch in Bridgeport we began the long drive home. The past two weeks had been very trying for me physically, but I had persevered. I had flown out to California, climbed 7 peaks and around 33,000 vertical feet in the Sierra Challenge, and then headed straight out to climb Matterhorn Pk. Quite the 10-day excursion to the High Sierra!

Sean Hermany and I climbed the N Couloir of North Peak and found the route to be fully in! Ice was just challenging enough, but not too hard. There was another team that forced their way past us (they simuled past me as I led P1, then stopped to pitch out the rest of the climb once above), so that was annoying and dangerous.&lt;/div&gt;\r\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\r\n&lt;div&gt;This climb is a relatively straightforward snow and neve solo for most of the year, and a ski descent well into summer, but if you catch it just right in the Fall before the winter storms come, you can catch it in the coveted condition as a dark sheen of bullet-proof ice. In this condition, real alpine ice is much harder to climb than water ice of the same angle. In this respect, 40-50 degree alpine ice feels to me to be more on par with WI3.&lt;/div&gt;\r\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;span style=\"border-collapse:collapse\"&gt;\r\n&lt;div style=\"font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:medium;line-height:normal\"&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;/div&gt;\r\n&lt;div style=\"font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:medium;line-height:normal\"&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-7XWUJs76boU/TKFZTuHHueI/AAAAAAABy3o/OW-neq2N8xI/s1600/2010-09-25%252520-%25252003%252520-%252520North%252520Peak%252520alpenglow.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-7XWUJs76boU/TKFZTuHHueI/AAAAAAABy3o/OW-neq2N8xI/s800/2010-09-25%252520-%25252003%252520-%252520North%252520Peak%252520alpenglow.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Alpenglow on the north side of North Peak.

We felt much stronger for this route as we had caught up on sleep and had acclimatized well. It was nice and warm, though the constant wind got us to keep our jackets on. On P7 I took what SuperTopo called a 5.7 variation that I thought was harder than any of the 5.9 sections of the route. It was a great variation, though - more interesting and much more true to the crest.\r\n&lt;div&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&amp;Acirc;&amp;nbsp;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-XTYaBYEIKt8/T7IQ3W11yAI/AAAAAAABGfQ/dZ0HhLtT9LE/s1600/2012-05-12%252520-%25252001%252520-%252520Mt%252520Russell.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"\" src=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-XTYaBYEIKt8/T7IQ3W11yAI/AAAAAAABGfQ/dZ0HhLtT9LE/s800/2012-05-12%252520-%25252001%252520-%252520Mt%252520Russell.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Mt Russell seen as we passed the Sierra Crest.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-1yBMGfdI6zo/T7_LrZApc8I/AAAAAAABGtI/OtDjivu02Nw/s1600/2012-05-12%252520-%25252001a%252520-%252520Mt%252520Russell%252520Close-annotated.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"\" src=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-1yBMGfdI6zo/T7_LrZApc8I/AAAAAAABGtI/OtDjivu02Nw/s800/2012-05-12%252520-%25252001a%252520-%252520Mt%252520Russell%252520Close-annotated.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&amp;Acirc;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Mt Russell seen as we passed the Sierra Crest.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-yH7oK2Ky0iQ/T7IQ83pz3oI/AAAAAAABGfo/PZ3ANDgAOlc/s1600/2012-05-12%252520-%25252007%252520-%252520Nearing%252520the%252520Base%252520of%252520Fishook%252520Arete.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"\" src=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-yH7oK2Ky0iQ/T7IQ83pz3oI/AAAAAAABGfo/PZ3ANDgAOlc/s800/2012-05-12%252520-%25252007%252520-%252520Nearing%252520the%252520Base%252520of%252520Fishook%252520Arete.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Nearing the base of Fishook Arete.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-myO0JEJE36M/T7IQ-jpyLoI/AAAAAAABGfw/brfVlL4O1hA/s1600/2012-05-12%252520-%25252009%252520-%252520Fishook%252520Arete%252520-%252520Leading%252520P1.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"\" src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-myO0JEJE36M/T7IQ-jpyLoI/AAAAAAABGfw/brfVlL4O1hA/s800/2012-05-12%252520-%25252009%252520-%252520Fishook%252520Arete%252520-%252520Leading%252520P1.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Fishook Arete, P1 exfoliating flakes.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-6tejKhwUZH4/T7IRAbYtoyI/AAAAAAABGf4/98xa03oYlkQ/s1600/2012-05-12%252520-%25252011%252520-%252520Fishook%252520Arete%252520-%252520Jared%252520Following%252520P1.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"\" src=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-6tejKhwUZH4/T7IRAbYtoyI/AAAAAAABGf4/98xa03oYlkQ/s800/2012-05-12%252520-%25252011%252520-%252520Fishook%252520Arete%252520-%252520Jared%252520Following%252520P1.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Jared following P1.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-6PAut_JcfI8/T7IRBFLtPHI/AAAAAAABGf8/vgDY7wZ7CHA/s1600/2012-05-12%252520-%25252012%252520-%252520Fishook%252520Arete%252520-%252520P2%252520Jared%252520Leading.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"\" src=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-6PAut_JcfI8/T7IRBFLtPHI/AAAAAAABGf8/vgDY7wZ7CHA/s800/2012-05-12%252520-%25252012%252520-%252520Fishook%252520Arete%252520-%252520P2%252520Jared%252520Leading.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Jared leading P2.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-XGtgP8naHMY/T7IRBhQ8f0I/AAAAAAABGgA/YOeHPH2qbVo/s1600/2012-05-12%252520-%25252013%252520-%252520Fishook%252520Arete%252520-%252520Jared%252520Atop%252520P2.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"\" src=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-XGtgP8naHMY/T7IRBhQ8f0I/AAAAAAABGgA/YOeHPH2qbVo/s800/2012-05-12%252520-%25252013%252520-%252520Fishook%252520Arete%252520-%252520Jared%252520Atop%252520P2.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Jared at P2 belay.

Just as you near the east summit, when the summit ridge starts rising again, look for a way to cut to the right of the crest. It is straightforward enough to downclimb some very steep, but solid cl. 3-4 terrain for about a hundred feet or so before reaching the sand and talus slope. From there it is an easy romp to camp. We started the downclimb just when we needed to use our headlamps, so it really can\'t be that tricky if you hit it right.&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-wonVKwU9qsc/T7IRgDqqKdI/AAAAAAABGiU/gkMHMNdFgxE/s1600/2012-05-13%252520-%25252001%252520-%252520Mt%252520Russell%252520at%252520Night.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"\" src=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-wonVKwU9qsc/T7IRgDqqKdI/AAAAAAABGiU/gkMHMNdFgxE/s800/2012-05-13%252520-%25252001%252520-%252520Mt%252520Russell%252520at%252520Night.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Mt Russell at night.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-lB_91NAFIfw/T7IRh3ISVkI/AAAAAAABGik/FipABGXNG1s/s1600/2012-05-13%252520-%25252004%252520-%252520Mt%252520Russell%252520from%252520Bivy.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"\" src=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-lB_91NAFIfw/T7IRh3ISVkI/AAAAAAABGik/FipABGXNG1s/s800/2012-05-13%252520-%25252004%252520-%252520Mt%252520Russell%252520from%252520Bivy.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Perfect bivy view of Mt Russell.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-cNJYPcxQX7s/T7_Lp5HFnII/AAAAAAABKJs/UML5T59mYOE/s1600/2012-05-11%252520-%25252027%252520-%252520Mt%252520Russell%252520from%252520E%252520Buttress-annotated.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"\" src=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-cNJYPcxQX7s/T7_Lp5HFnII/AAAAAAABKJs/UML5T59mYOE/s800/2012-05-11%252520-%25252027%252520-%252520Mt%252520Russell%252520from%252520E%252520Buttress-annotated.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Mt Russell from the E Buttress of Mt Whitney.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-7nvNa8NH4ho/T7_Lq2uTSQI/AAAAAAABJ1w/YOtdK42l9Yc/s1600/2012-05-11%252520-%25252028%252520-%252520Mt%252520Russell%252520from%252520E%252520Buttress-annotated.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"\" src=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-7nvNa8NH4ho/T7_Lq2uTSQI/AAAAAAABJ1w/YOtdK42l9Yc/s800/2012-05-11%252520-%25252028%252520-%252520Mt%252520Russell%252520from%252520E%252520Buttress-annotated.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Mt Russell\'s Mithral Dihedral &amp;amp; Fishook Arete from the E Buttress of Mt Whitney.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;hr&gt;\r\n&lt;hr&gt;\r\n&lt;h2&gt;\r\n&lt;a name=\"TOC-Links\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Links&lt;/h2&gt;\r\n&lt;div&gt;\r\n&lt;ul&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://picasaweb.google.com/105894936663116565516/20120512RussellFishhookAreteWJaredWoodIII598P?authuser=0&amp;amp;feat=directlink\"&gt;Picasa Album&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://www.supertopo.com/tr/Mt-Russell-Fishhook-Arete-III-5-9-8P-via-a-Unique-Variation-Photo-TR/t11972n.html\"&gt;SuperTopo&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;/ul&gt;\r\n&lt;/div&gt;\r\n&lt;/div&gt;\r\n&lt;/div&gt;\r\n&lt;/div&gt; \r\n'),(76,55,'/mountaineering/trip-reports/california/mt-russell-mithral-dihedral','Mt Russell (Mithral Dihedral)','Mt Russell, Mithral Dihedral (III, 5.10, 7P)','Trip_Report','content: &lt;div dir=\"ltr\"&gt;\r\n&lt;h1&gt;\r\n&lt;a name=\"TOC-Mt-Russell-Mithral-Dihedral-III-5.10-7P-\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Mt Russell, Mithral Dihedral (III, 5.10, 7P)&lt;/h1&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-_dWdDTWUF8I/US3Q0VQYkEI/AAAAAAABr7Q/rQvF1jou0ws/s1600/2012-05-12%2520-%252001a%2520-%2520Mt%2520Russell%2520Close-annotated-Mithral.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"\" src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-_dWdDTWUF8I/US3Q0VQYkEI/AAAAAAABr7Q/rQvF1jou0ws/s800/2012-05-12%2520-%252001a%2520-%2520Mt%2520Russell%2520Close-annotated-Mithral.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;2012-05-12 - Mt Russell seen as we passed the Sierra Crest.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;h2&gt;\r\n&lt;a name=\"TOC-June-30-2012\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;June 30, 2012&lt;/h2&gt;\r\n&lt;div&gt;Jared Wood and I climbed Mithral Dihedral car-to-car. We started hiking at 3:30 am, and after whimsically taking a very interesting shortcut through Sakai Col, we reached the base of the climb about 5 hours since we first started. Jared accidentally linked P1 &amp;amp; P2, taking a 30 ft lead fall at the end of P2 (oops) but was unscathed. I linked P3 &amp;amp; P4 in a non-stop altitude-induced pant fest. Then I climbed P5 to finish the awesome dihedral. Jared led the next pitch and then we simul-climbed to the summit. The sun set as we descended the final scree chute to Upper Boy Scout Lake. Sleep-deprived, we took a few naps ACROSS the trail on the descent. I\'m not sure how long the naps were (one must have been at least an hour), but we got back to the car at 1:30am Sunday, making for a 22.5 hr outing! The next day we found some nice arches for a future night photo project :-)\r\n&lt;div&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;div&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&amp;Acirc;&amp;nbsp;\r\n\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-DKJih9mANqA/T_O9DkMhfbI/AAAAAAABKrs/-gx40Q5cOos/s1600/2012-06-30%252520-%25252002%252520-%252520Alpengow%252520above%252520Upper%252520Boy%252520Scout%252520Lake.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"\" src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-DKJih9mANqA/T_O9DkMhfbI/AAAAAAABKrs/-gx40Q5cOos/s800/2012-06-30%252520-%25252002%252520-%252520Alpengow%252520above%252520Upper%252520Boy%252520Scout%252520Lake.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Alpenglow on the cliffs above Upper Boy Scout Lake.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-F0QZf2DtXjI/T_O9E1odK5I/AAAAAAABKr0/GOswpjmuxNU/s1600/2012-06-30%252520-%25252004%252520-%252520Upper%252520Boy%252520Scout%252520Lake.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"\" src=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-F0QZf2DtXjI/T_O9E1odK5I/AAAAAAABKr0/GOswpjmuxNU/s800/2012-06-30%252520-%25252004%252520-%252520Upper%252520Boy%252520Scout%252520Lake.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Upper Boy Scout Lake at sunrise.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;div&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;/div&gt;\r\nI thought I remembered there being a way to the SW side of Mt Russell from the SE side, and as I have been up to Iceberg Lake a few too many times, I suggested we try this other variation and Jared was game for it. We later learned that our route passed through what is called Sakai Col. This variation gave us some very interesting views of some seldom-climbed aretes on Mt Russell. Although this col requires an obnoxious amount of slogging on sandy side slopes and a big switchback, I think these unexpected views made this approach variation worthwhile.&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a

When he shouted down to me, all I could shout back were some vague landmarks. At some point it became obvious that he had missed the belay and was leading into P2. I wondered if a 60m rope was enough to link the two, and my answer came as I ran out of rope, probably about the time Jared was about 10 ft short of the P2 belay. I was just about to untie from the anchor to start simul-climbing to let him finish when the rope came tight! There was no slack to lose at this point. Apparently Jared was on a thin part and got tunnel-vision about getting to the belay ledge, and slipped right before it. Since he was feeling confident, his last piece of gear was a ways down and he fell clean about 30 ft. Apart from a few scratches and maybe a bruised ego, he was fine, and led right back up the pitch, placing gear closer to the finishing crux this next time.&lt;/div&gt;\r\n&lt;div&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-oK17d6sYeO4/T_O9X-UOw8I/AAAAAAABKuA/NQiO_W8BbzM/s1600/2012-06-30%252520-%25252036%252520-%252520Following%252520P2.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"\" src=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-oK17d6sYeO4/T_O9X-UOw8I/AAAAAAABKuA/NQiO_W8BbzM/s800/2012-06-30%252520-%25252036%252520-%252520Following%252520P2.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Following P2, near 5.8+ crux.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/--rKJWmHZOCQ/T_O9Yb2cQjI/AAAAAAABKuE/tKdP5S_aHRo/s1600/2012-06-30%252520-%25252037%252520-%252520Jared%252520at%252520P2%252520Belay.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"\" src=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/--rKJWmHZOCQ/T_O9Yb2cQjI/AAAAAAABKuE/tKdP5S_aHRo/s800/2012-06-30%252520-%25252037%252520-%252520Jared%252520at%252520P2%252520Belay.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Jared at P2 belay.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;div&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;/div&gt;\r\nThis corner was great!

The Meadows is a hanging valley, dramatically cut out of the surrounding granite cliffs &amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#147; while vertical rock walls surrounded the meadow, the meadow itself was extremely flat and very lush. The campsites here are great, but sadly, all of the spots were taken by the time we had finished backpacking in from the Big Pine trailhead. This probably had to do with the fact that we had only managed to get a permit for the following night but headed up anyways. After some scouting across the stream, we had found a flat spot amid the jumble of trees and large boulders to pitch a tent, and now we were making the best of our cramped quarters.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;\r\nThis was my second trip with Dirk, and our aim was to climb the Swiss Ar&amp;Atilde;&amp;ordf;te on Mt Sill, a classic Sierra route. Joel was a graduate student at Berkeley who had joined me on some earlier climbs, and I invited him along for some more company. He would solo the North Couloir while Dirk and I were on the ar&amp;Atilde;&amp;ordf;te.     \r\n&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;\r\nAs we were settling in for the night, I noticed that I couldn&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;t find my headlamp. Crap! I must have lost it when we slept out at Tioga Pass! Ah well, the route wasn&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;t nearly as long as the West Ridge of Mt Conness and the approach was much shorter. Besides, what were the chances of Dirk and me getting caught out in the dark two trips in a row! Still, I had preferred to wake up a little earlier just in case, but ultimately our plan was to be out of camp at daybreak. \r\n&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;\r\n&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;table&gt;\r\n&lt;tbody&gt;\r\n&lt;tr&gt;\r\n&lt;td&gt;\r\n&lt;div style=\"text-align:center\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-sUq6bYayLqo/TjFUvy0YNkI/AAAAAAAAj2E/Cesp6nXywHI/s2000/MtSill-Approach1.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-sUq6bYayLqo/TjFUvy0YNkI/AAAAAAAAj2E/Cesp6nXywHI/s400/MtSill-Approach1.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;\r\n&lt;div style=\"text-align:center\"&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Palisades from the Owens Valley&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\r\n&lt;/b&gt;\r\n&lt;/td&gt;\r\n&lt;td&gt;\r\n&lt;div style=\"text-align:center\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-9AG6Ktto-s0/UHouYO46i9I/AAAAAAABZRk/pNMtUUTTL9o/s2000/bm%2520-%2520Sam%2520Mack%2520Meadows.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-9AG6Ktto-s0/UHouYO46i9I/AAAAAAABZRk/pNMtUUTTL9o/s400/bm%2520-%2520Sam%2520Mack%2520Meadows.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;\r\n&lt;div style=\"text-align:center\"&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Sam Mack Meadows (by Dirk Summers)&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\r\n&lt;/b&gt;\r\n&lt;/td&gt;\r\n&lt;/tr&gt;\r\n&lt;/tbody&gt;\r\n&lt;/table&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;div style=\"text-align:center\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-Zu9GMq-bS1s/TjFUosjTKLI/AAAAAAAAj1o/2pv9hCvgURc/s2000/MtSill-TempleCrag1.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-Zu9GMq-bS1s/TjFUosjTKLI/AAAAAAAAj1o/2pv9hCvgURc/s800/MtSill-TempleCrag1.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;\r\n&lt;div style=\"text-align:center\"&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Temple Crag seen from Second Lake.

Joe, Dirk, and I were on our way up the remainder of the trail by 7am.     \r\n\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;\r\nThe trail switch-backed steeply up the rugged hillside before traversing back out onto the eastern flanks.  It was difficult to see our progress as boulders often obstructed our line-of-sight - the slope was covered with hundreds of large rocks that had probably fallen down from the glacial moraine above.  Just as we reached the end of the trail, we stumbled upon another camp. There was no water here, and the site was rocky and exposed to wind, but it was flat and was much closer to the Palisade Glacier.  The campers were part of a Mountain Search and Rescue Team that had come up to practice some rescue drills around the glacier. As we said our hellos I joked that it was nice that they were around in case we get in trouble. Little did I know that our struggle to come would provide them with some night time entertainment as they watched us descend in the dark from the warmth of their campsite.    \r\n&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;\r\nAbove the MSAR camp we followed ducks across a long series of granite slabs. Eventually the solid rock gave way to the Palisade glacial moraine, and our pace really slowed down. The rock was very loose, and many of the boulders were large enough to require some class 3 scrambling or some careful leaping (trusting that the boulder you&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;re landing on won&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;t roll, of course).    \r\n&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;\r\nAs we passed beneath Mt Gayley we finally had to begin walking on the glacier to gain the chute we needed to climb to reach the Glacier Notch. Just as our sources in Bishop had warned, the glacier was nothing but bullet-proof ice. Walking on the ice was very odd since you&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;d step up on your crampon spikes, and there&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;d be a half-second delay before the ice popped and the teeth dug in. The delay between these little drops as the crampons bit in was unnerving, and I made sure to wait for the pop&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;n drop on each step before moving up. Sometimes the surface would crack like a spider web as the ice popped.   \r\n&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;\r\nI had been foolish enough to leave my ice axe at home on this trip. Although you couldn&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;t get enough purchase with the spike for a self-belay, it would have been nice to have for balance. Oh well, nothing to do but walk up and practice on my footwork! As I lamely chased Dirk and Joel up the slopes, Dirk would occasionally offer support and some suggestions on how to place my feet.    \r\n&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;\r\n&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#156;Try to walk in the bottoms of the snow cups!&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#157;    &lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Nice &amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#147; its almost like walking on stairs now!  As I hurried up the black ice I stumbled across an energy gel pack frozen into the ice.     \r\n&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;\r\nFree food!    \r\n&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;\r\nThe wrapper was intact, so I freed this treat from the freezer and stuffed it in a pocket for later.   \r\n&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;\r\nSoon we were at the chute, which was nothing more than a steep class 2-3 pile of loose rubble.  After some careful climbing we reached the Glacier Notch. With Mt Gayley to our left, the monolithic block of Mt Sill jutting up to our right, and the gorgeous Palisade Glacier lined by a vertical granite wall over 1,000 ft high, I felt exhilarated. This was some awesome mountain country! \r\n&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;\r\n&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"http://www.markpthomas.com/mountaineering/trip-reports/california/mark-n-dirk-s-bivouac-trilogy---part-2-mt-sill\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\r\n&lt;table style=\"text-align:center\"&gt;\r\n&lt;tbody&gt;\r\n&lt;tr&gt;\r\n&lt;td&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-kX3uP-amcG8/UHot7hF0k-I/AAAAAAABZNo/2cwXL8C7RzY/s2000/ag%2520N%2520Palisade%2520%2526%2520glacier.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-kX3uP-amcG8/UHot7hF0k-I/AAAAAAABZNo/2cwXL8C7RzY/s400/ag%2520N%2520Palisade%2520%2526%2520glacier.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Palisade Glacier (by Dirk Summers)&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;\r\n&lt;/td&gt;\r\n&lt;td&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/--wHgbX97jmQ/TjFUxuGTjoI/AAAAAAAAj2M/9yjrT6JNUAo/s2000/MtSill-NorthPalisade1.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/--wHgbX97jmQ/TjFUxuGTjoI/AAAAAAAAj2M/9yjrT6JNUAo/s400/MtSill-NorthPalisade1.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Palisades Seen from Glacier Notch&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;\r\n&lt;/td&gt;\r\n&lt;/tr&gt;\r\n&lt;/tbody&gt;\r\n&lt;/table&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;h2&gt;\r\n&lt;a name=\"TOC-The-Swiss-Ar-te\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;The Swiss Ar&amp;Atilde;&amp;ordf;te&lt;/h2&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;\r\nAt this point we parted ways and Joel took off up the North Couloir while Dirk and I donned our climbing gear. We started climbing at 12:02 &amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#147; a late start. The approach had taken much longer than expected! The first two pitches were easy class 4, and Dirk quickly led the way. This first part of the climb, although very fun, also seemed very lame. Perhaps it was having the North Couloir right next to us, or perhaps it was Joel racing up the thing beside and then past us as we belayed the rock. Soon Joel was up and out of site and Dirk and I had reached the spine of the Ar&amp;Atilde;&amp;ordf;te.     \r\n&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;\r\n&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;table style=\"text-align:center\"&gt;\r\n&lt;tbody&gt;\r\n&lt;tr&gt;\r\n&lt;td&gt;\r\n&lt;div style=\"text-align:center\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-yfF3GVSOeMY/TjFU9xh8iJI/AAAAAAAAj3A/t-KpFFr6ZGk/s2000/MtSill-SwissArete2.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-yfF3GVSOeMY/TjFU9xh8iJI/AAAAAAAAj3A/t-KpFFr6ZGk/s400/MtSill-SwissArete2.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Swiss Arete of Mt Sill&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;\r\n&lt;/td&gt;\r\n&lt;td&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-OPSm_6N5yJw/UPLwL4XBZyI/AAAAAAABoPo/lAa5C0RNwkY/s2000/39817.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-OPSm_6N5yJw/UPLwL4XBZyI/AAAAAAABoPo/lAa5C0RNwkY/s400/39817.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;The North Couloir of Mt Sill (by Bob Burd)&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;\r\n&lt;/td&gt;\r\n&lt;/tr&gt;\r\n&lt;/tbody&gt;\r\n&lt;/table&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;\r\nThe exposure was stimulating and the climbing was sustained and moderate. It was also very clean and solid, which left us with few worries on the route.  As we climbed higher I watched a lone figure climbing Gayley. This fellow had topped out on the Glacier Notch just after us, climbing with some strange trekking poles that had little ice axes on the handles. I was surprised to see that as we climbed higher on the route, this figure summitted, descended, and then began free-soloing the rocky bulge lining the north side of the North Couloir. Joel later reported that the guy had summitted Mt Sill and beat him down the mountain.    \r\n&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;\r\nAlthough the exposure was exciting, it also had me stressed. I&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;ve always been a wuss when it comes to exposed heights, but through climbing I&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;ve been beating back this fear. Still, it is always somewhat psychologically draining to be in a confined position on a cliff face for most of a day, and as we neared the final pitches of the route I was beginning to look forward to some reprieve.    \r\n&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;\r\n&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;table style=\"text-align:center\"&gt;\r\n&lt;tbody&gt;\r\n&lt;tr&gt;\r\n&lt;td&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-Y30hrNgzEc4/TjFVA7EFKCI/AAAAAAAAj3M/0A0TEvcfSkg/s2000/MtSill-SwissArete-NorthCouloir2-Joel.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-Y30hrNgzEc4/TjFVA7EFKCI/AAAAAAAAj3M/0A0TEvcfSkg/s400/MtSill-SwissArete-NorthCouloir2-Joel.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Joel Climbing the North Couloir, Seen from the Swiss Arete.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;\r\n&lt;/td&gt;\r\n&lt;td&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-i4yKcXZwiEg/TjFVKXdIpkI/AAAAAAAAj3w/K2k3iaMCyNU/s2000/Dirk-MtSill-SwissArete2.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-i4yKcXZwiEg/TjFVKXdIpkI/AAAAAAAAj3w/K2k3iaMCyNU/s400/Dirk-MtSill-SwissArete2.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Dirk Getting Ready to Lead the Next Pitch&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;\r\n&lt;/td&gt;\r\n&lt;/tr&gt;\r\n&lt;/tbody&gt;\r\n&lt;/table&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;\r\nI knew that the next pitch would be trouble when Dirk began climbing very slowly, and some loud grunts and groans could be heard over the wind. We had been looking out for the reach-around move for a while and had yet to come across it. Perhaps this was the crux?  Once it was my turn, I quickly climbed up the rock and came to a narrow ledge on the south side of the ar&amp;Atilde;&amp;ordf;te, just below a chimney. The chimney was steep, and slightly overhanging on the first 5 feet. It angled a bit to the left for another 10 feet before shooting strait up the rock.  &amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#156;Hmmm . . . this doesn&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;t look right,&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#157; I thought to myself. I also realized that while I have climbed plenty of cracks on sandstone in the southwest, none of it required entire reliance on hand and foot-jamming.  I looked at the 1,000 foot drop off below the ledge, back to the chimney, and back to the drop off again.    \r\n&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;\r\nCrap.    \r\n\r\n&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;\r\nI racked the first piece of pro and started up the crack. Then I began flailing about like some deranged lunatic. This crack climbing had me very sketched &amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#147; I couldn&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;t tell if I could trust my hand jams, so I was afraid to pull up much in the crack. After climbing all afternoon with a large 30lb pack, a large pack that was now trying to pull me backward into the void and upside down, my arms burned out after struggling about 4 feet up the crack.    \r\n&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;\r\n&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#156;Take!&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#157; I shouted, and the rope went tight. I hung on the end for a rest and tried again. I began popping out of the crack. After wasting some more time trying to climb the thing, Dirk and I communicated that I would try to haul myself up the rope just a little bit get past this short section. I tried to pull on the rope for aid, but that didn&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;t work very well. Next I pulled out a cordalette and tied a prussick. I couldn&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;t find a second cordalette, so I tried climbing up the rope with one prussick. I got about 2 feet further, cursing all the way. Just as Dirk was beginning to shout out directions for a Texas Prussick, I found another cordalette, tied a second prussick to stand up in, and I was off, up cliff face and over the headwall. After dispensing with the dignity of climbing the full pitch, I dispensed with the prussicks and quickly climbed the easy remainder of the crack.  &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;NOTE TO SELF: Next time I&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;m at the gym, I must learn crack climbing!&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;\r\n&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;div style=\"text-align:center\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-5Yp0uuG_5vs/TjFVGq_TFHI/AAAAAAAAj3k/4-w3M3f3dIg/s2000/MtSill-SwissArete3.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-5Yp0uuG_5vs/TjFVGq_TFHI/AAAAAAAAj3k/4-w3M3f3dIg/s800/MtSill-SwissArete3.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;\r\n&lt;div style=\"text-align:center\"&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Norman Clyde Pk Seen from the Swiss Arete.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\r\n&lt;/b&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;\r\nBy the time I reached Dirk&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;s belay the sky was beginning to darken. That last pitch wasted a ton of time, and it was definitely harder than 5.6! Dirk was concerned about our dwindling daylight and was off like a rocket up the next pitch. One more easy pitch and a few photos later and we were standing on top of the summit. It was 7:11 pm. We signed the register and then began reviewing the description of the route down. It was obvious that we would have to descend the unfamiliar route in the dark. More problematic was the fact that I was sans headlamp.\r\n&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;\r\n&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;h2&gt;\r\n&lt;a name=\"TOC-2-Climbers-1-Headlamp\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;2 Climbers, 1 Headlamp&lt;/h2&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;\r\nResigned to our fate, we watched the sun set over the Palisades from the summit of Mt Sill before heading down to the North Couloir traverse. There were large boulders that made the scrambling difficult, and it was difficult to follow the ducks. Finally we reached a spot that we thought was the turnoff, and with no real certainty, began picking our way down the cliffs toward the Palisade Glacier.    \r\n&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;\r\n&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;table style=\"text-align:center\"&gt;\r\n&lt;tbody&gt;\r\n&lt;tr&gt;\r\n&lt;td&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-u24qLMiOdM8/TjFVMNZv85I/AAAAAAAAj34/M1UMsOa79Xk/s2000/MtSill-SwissArete6.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-u24qLMiOdM8/TjFVMNZv85I/AAAAAAAAj34/M1UMsOa79Xk/s400/MtSill-SwissArete6.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Swiss Arete in Fading Light&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;\r\n&lt;/td&gt;\r\n&lt;td&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-QiGmmFB6dng/TjFVYWJKY_I/AAAAAAAAj4s/5JRzBU8_gK8/s2000/MtSill-Summit3.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-QiGmmFB6dng/TjFVYWJKY_I/AAAAAAAAj4s/5JRzBU8_gK8/s400/MtSill-Summit3.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Sunset from the Summit of Mt Sill&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;\r\n&lt;/td&gt;\r\n&lt;/tr&gt;\r\n&lt;/tbody&gt;\r\n&lt;/table&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;\r\nThe climbing was very slow going. I would climb under the diffused lighting of the headlamp as best as I could, and whenever we reached a steeper part, I&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;d wait for Dirk to climb down and shine the light back up for me to follow.  At one point we weren&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;t sure if we were heading the right way, or when to traverse the cliffs back to the east. The terrain was getting steeper, which was a concern, so Dirk climbed off to scout out a route while I sat alone in the dark.    \r\n&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;\r\nAfter what seemed like an eternity sitting in the wind, Dirk reappeared. He had found a way out! It required some tricky down climbing with one headlamp, and some occasional verglass on some of the narrower traverses to spice things up. Finally we reached the notch between Mt Sill and its subpeak. All that we had left was to descend the straightforward North Couloir to Glacier Notch, and down to the Glacier, and we&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;d be home free!    \r\n&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;\r\nWRONG!  \r\n&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;\r\nThe chute was complete and utter crap. Every step resulted in a miniature landslide of talus, scree, sand, and climber. So much dust was kicked up that visibility with the headlamp became difficult.  Progress was painfully slow, and after descending about halfway down the chute, we stopped for a break.    \r\n&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;\r\nHere I decided to make use of the energy gel pack that I had found frozen in the Palisade Glacier. I had never had one before and wondered how it would taste - TERRIBLE! From then on I\'ve stuck with Cliff Bars to avoid a repeat of the experience.   \r\n&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;\r\n&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;table style=\"text-align:center\"&gt;\r\n&lt;tbody&gt;\r\n&lt;tr&gt;\r\n&lt;td&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-tPtQ-Jqexu8/UPLwOgcsMqI/AAAAAAABoPw/ArHkxBY5Dww/s2000/39820.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-tPtQ-Jqexu8/UPLwOgcsMqI/AAAAAAABoPw/ArHkxBY5Dww/s400/39820.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Cl. 4 Descent from Mt Sill that we Did in the Dark (by Bob Burd)&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;\r\n&lt;/td&gt;\r\n&lt;td&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-oaZLOiuTdp4/UPLwPEf7-0I/AAAAAAABoP4/xfFM0E4ntdA/s2000/39818.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-oaZLOiuTdp4/UPLwPEf7-0I/AAAAAAABoP4/xfFM0E4ntdA/s400/39818.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Cl. 4 Descent from Mt Sill that we Did in the Dark (by Bob Burd)&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;\r\n&lt;/td&gt;\r\n&lt;/tr&gt;\r\n&lt;/tbody&gt;\r\n&lt;/table&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;\r\nAfter a snack and finishing off my water, I was really sleepy and needed to lie down for a bit. Also, although I had learned from our last epic and brought more clothes, I didn&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;t have a windbreaker and the wind was blowing right through my clothing, whisking away any heat that they might have held. I found a 2-in-1 solution for this by climbing up into the rock on the side of the couloir. There was an angled slab, steep enough to slide off of, that made a nice bed and offered some protection from the wind. After wedging my thigh in a space between the slab and some other rock to hold me in place, I laid down for a nap.    \r\n&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;\r\nAll too soon Dirk had us rallied and we continued down the poop-chute. Finally we reached a point where we couldn&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;t help but walk on the icy neve. Luckily someone had placed some slings in the solid rock, providing us with a good anchor to rapp off. Dirk set up the rope and I was the first down, walking down the icy slope while hanging on the rope for control.    \r\n&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;\r\nYes! We were at the Glacier Notch! Now the rest of the way back was familiar and we&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;d certainly make it down!    \r\n&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;\r\nWRONG!  \r\n&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;\r\nWe looked over the cliffs that dropped down to the glacier, looking for the right chute. We had some idea as to which chute it might be, but there was still a LOT of uncertainty. Dirk wanted to just climb down one, and if it ended, rappel the rest if the way. I wasn&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;t keen on rappelling a route we didn&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;t know, in the dark, with one headlamp, so I kept trying to narrow down our options. By this time it was almost 2am, and we gave up. The sun would be rising in a few hours &amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#147; I pointed out that we might as well bivouac for those few hours and descend once we could see where we were going.    \r\n&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;\r\nAlthough we were cold, tired, and hungry, we were still enjoying the experience at some twisted level. High above us in the sky Mars was making the closest transit to Earth that it had for thousands of years, and with the thin night air, it looked like a giant glowing orb in the sky.  The rugged silhouettes of Mt Gayley and Mt Sill towered above, framing a starry night sky. After watching a few shooting stars, we each climbed into whatever shelter we could find from the wind. I found a small cave in the interstices between the large talus blocks, and quickly climbed down and inside. Dirk was nice enough to let me borrow his wind breaker for a little while to regain some heat while he did pushups to keep warm. I was so exhausted from our climb that I couldn&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;t imagine doing something like that to &lt;i&gt;ease&lt;/i&gt; my discomfort. I watched in disbelief and then we went to sleep.      \r\n  &lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;div style=\"text-align:center\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-215FEHbR5Qo/UHouNBQPxQI/AAAAAAABZQM/UkaAXQrBLL4/s2000/ba%2520Mark%2520camping.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-215FEHbR5Qo/UHouNBQPxQI/AAAAAAABZQM/UkaAXQrBLL4/s800/ba%2520Mark%2520camping.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;\r\n&lt;div style=\"text-align:center\"&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Wombat Bivy Hole&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&amp;Acirc;&amp;nbsp;(by Dirk Summers)&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;\r\n&lt;/div&gt;\r\n&lt;/b&gt;\r\n&lt;h2&gt;\r\n&lt;a name=\"TOC-Glorious-Alpenglow\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Glorious Alpenglow&lt;/h2&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;\r\n  A few hours later the sky lit up behind Mt Gayley - the night was over! Now we can get down!  With the sun rising, we quickly found the right chute and began climbing down. On our way down we were treated to a wonderful alpenglow that illuminated North Palisade, changing it from a dark black to a fiery orange. It was one of the best alpenglow sunrises I have ever witnessed in the Sierra.    \r\n&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;div style=\"text-align:center\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-GBuggGKJaYA/TjFVQTu3cnI/AAAAAAAAj4M/R_Qv58WWJYM/s2000/MtSill-MtGayley5.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-GBuggGKJaYA/TjFVQTu3cnI/AAAAAAAAj4M/R_Qv58WWJYM/s800/MtSill-MtGayley5.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;\r\n&lt;div style=\"text-align:center\"&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Mt Gayley at sunrise&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\r\n&lt;/b&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;\r\nDown the chute, over the moraine, back to camp we go! We hurried as fast as we could, since Joel would be waking soon and would certainly notice our absence.  As we reached the trail we came across a welcome site &amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#147; Joel was huffing it up the trail, carrying a pack with food and water!  He had noticed that we never came back and had woken early in order to head back up to Mt Sill to search for us. He had asked MSAR about us, and they reported watching our headlamp slowly make its way down Mt Sill throughout the night, so he knew that we were all right.    \r\n&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;\r\n&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;table&gt;\r\n&lt;tbody&gt;\r\n&lt;tr&gt;\r\n&lt;td&gt;\r\n&lt;div style=\"text-align:center\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-M2CJYRAS3Mo/TjFVXM5fI-I/AAAAAAAAj4o/fRgA7H6XQ1E/s2000/MtSill-NorthPalisade4.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-M2CJYRAS3Mo/TjFVXM5fI-I/AAAAAAAAj4o/fRgA7H6XQ1E/s400/MtSill-NorthPalisade4.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;\r\n&lt;div style=\"text-align:center\"&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Alpenglow on the Palisades&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\r\n&lt;/b&gt;\r\n&lt;/td&gt;\r\n&lt;td&gt;\r\n&lt;div style=\"text-align:center\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-gUMss88C7U0/TjFVULHQcNI/AAAAAAAAj4g/r0E4cTGKCOc/s2000/MtSill-Rockslide.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-gUMss88C7U0/TjFVULHQcNI/AAAAAAAAj4g/r0E4cTGKCOc/s400/MtSill-Rockslide.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;\r\n&lt;div style=\"text-align:center\"&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Rock avalanche on Mt Alice&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\r\n&lt;/b&gt;\r\n&lt;/td&gt;\r\n&lt;/tr&gt;\r\n&lt;/tbody&gt;\r\n&lt;/table&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;\r\nAfter refueling, we hiked back down the trail to pack up our tent and head back to civilization.

Perhaps our little illegal camping had brought on some bad karma?

With 3 days at our disposal, we had hoped to combine it with a traverse to Gayley or even Sill (DarGaySil Traverse, anyone? Sounds like a pharmaceutical). To avoid doing a carryover of Dark Star, we cached our climbing gear and water at the base of the route, then packed our camp and remaining food and water for the trip up Contact Crack (5.4) to the top of the route, where we slept. We descended before sunrise to do the route, with the idea to pick up camp and continue along the ridge for bivy #2. Instead we finished shortly after dark and woke up feeling tired and lazy. So we visited the summit and had a leisurely time heading out. \r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-zMntlsHqK3I/UIjV8wQEIkI/AAAAAAABcE4/N8VvZEQQ-FA/s2000/MtSill-TempleCrag1%2520-%2520annotated.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-zMntlsHqK3I/UIjV8wQEIkI/AAAAAAABcE4/N8VvZEQQ-FA/s640/MtSill-TempleCrag1%2520-%2520annotated.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;The looong Dark Star route on Temple Crag, seen from Second Lake on the approach trail.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;hr&gt;\r\n&lt;hr&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-6c4UC-6izFU/UIjU4rsRRmI/AAAAAAABcC0/wY_bGkLYUe0/s2000/2006%2520-09-09-CloudRipper%2520021%2520-%2520annotate.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-6c4UC-6izFU/UIjU4rsRRmI/AAAAAAABcC0/wY_bGkLYUe0/s640/2006%2520-09-09-CloudRipper%2520021%2520-%2520annotate.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;The massive buttress of Dark Star on Temple Crag, seen from Cloudripper.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"javascript:void(0);\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-E60-dOrn4Dc/UIjU-4hLRfI/AAAAAAABcC8/TZckj8yYzCQ/s640/2010-06-19%2520-%252007%2520-%2520%2520Dark%2520Star%2520on%2520Temple%2520Crag%2520-%2520annotated.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Dark Star seen from the Palisade Glacier moraine.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-Pk-dhIHJ_LA/UIjVAeBxmDI/AAAAAAABcDE/-7yafe3Z0Vs/s2000/2011-09-05%2520-%252004%2520-%2520Temple%2520Crag%2520from%25202nd%2520Lake%2520-%2520annotate%2520-%2520Dark%2520Star.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-Pk-dhIHJ_LA/UIjVAeBxmDI/AAAAAAABcDE/-7yafe3Z0Vs/s640/2011-09-05%2520-%252004%2520-%2520Temple%2520Crag%2520from%25202nd%2520Lake%2520-%2520annotate%2520-%2520Dark%2520Star.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Dark Star route on Temple Crag&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-SzwFNWtxwZQ/UIjVHgtRcjI/AAAAAAABcDc/VaTbXVu1Pho/s2000/2012-10-01%2520-%252005%2520-%2520Dark%2520Star%2520Lower%2520Buttress%2520-%2520annotated.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-SzwFNWtxwZQ/UIjVHgtRcjI/AAAAAAABcDc/VaTbXVu1Pho/s640/2012-10-01%2520-%252005%2520-%2520Dark%2520Star%2520Lower%2520Buttress%2520-%2520annotated.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Dark Star\'s Lower Buttress seen on the descent.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-Z64g2WKWzPs/UIjVBqwXw6I/AAAAAAABcDM/-WfpTY6Fau0/s2000/2012-09-29%2520-%252003%2520-%2520Dark%2520Star%2520Lower%2520Buttress%2520%2526%2520Lower%2520Pitches%2520-%2520annotated.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-Z64g2WKWzPs/UIjVBqwXw6I/AAAAAAABcDM/-WfpTY6Fau0/s640/2012-09-29%2520-%252003%2520-%2520Dark%2520Star%2520Lower%2520Buttress%2520%2526%2520Lower%2520Pitches%2520-%2520annotated.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Dark Star lower buttress and lower pitches.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;hr&gt;\r\n&lt;hr&gt;\r\n&lt;h2&gt;\r\n&lt;a name=\"TOC-September-29---Approach\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;September 29 - Approach&lt;/h2&gt;\r\n\r\nThe hike went all too quickly for me. As we were hiking in, I realized that this was my 13th trip into the Palisades from the Big Pine TH, and my 9th heading up the North Fork trail.

There are still at least a few more climbs for me to come back for, so I guess this shows how much there is to do in the Palisades!\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"http://lh6.ggpht.com/-PpbrNM4uljo/UGvyyplM2HI/AAAAAAABal8/4BtHbAEGxBA/s2000/2012-09-29%252520-%25252003%252520-%252520Dark%252520Star%252520Lower%252520Buttress%252520%252526%252520Lower%252520Pitches.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"http://lh6.ggpht.com/-PpbrNM4uljo/UGvyyplM2HI/AAAAAAABal8/4BtHbAEGxBA/s640/2012-09-29%252520-%25252003%252520-%252520Dark%252520Star%252520Lower%252520Buttress%252520%252526%252520Lower%252520Pitches.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Lower buttress of Dark Star, which is over 1,000 ft high.

I was intrigued with the idea of climbing the lower pitches for full credit, rather than doing the standard start of traversing out on a ledge several hundred feet higher. I was wary of adding more pitches to an already long route at such a late time of the year. Tony was wary that the lower pitches would suck. So we walked over to check it out and decide whether to leave our cache here or by the start of the ledge higher up.\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"http://lh6.ggpht.com/-rRbCVRvRDuU/UGvy1xMLIdI/AAAAAAABamA/eBc4D_t9rKc/s2000/2012-09-29%252520-%25252004%252520-%252520Looking%252520up%252520Dark%252520Star.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"http://lh6.ggpht.com/-rRbCVRvRDuU/UGvy1xMLIdI/AAAAAAABamA/eBc4D_t9rKc/s640/2012-09-29%252520-%25252004%252520-%252520Looking%252520up%252520Dark%252520Star.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Looking up the lower buttress of Dark Star from the base.

Weirdos :-)  We caught up to them at the pass and learned that they were doing Sill via the South Fork side of Glacier Notch and decided this way was better than the cross-country route up from the South Fork Trail.\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"http://lh3.ggpht.com/-uSUV4PgZ7hs/UGvzIBy_YZI/AAAAAAABamc/8oH1SzH51wc/s2000/2012-09-29%252520-%25252011%252520-%252520Contact%252520Crack.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"http://lh3.ggpht.com/-uSUV4PgZ7hs/UGvzIBy_YZI/AAAAAAABamc/8oH1SzH51wc/s640/2012-09-29%252520-%25252011%252520-%252520Contact%252520Crack.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Contact Crack (5.4).

One #3 Metolius cam nicely protects the crux.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\nI roped up briefly to lead Contact Crack. The first time I climbed Temple Crag was on a Sierra Challenge day, and with a smaller pack I was all right soloing the awkward 5.4 slot. This time, my pack was substantially larger, so we decided to play it safe and belay this section. There was one part that was awkward enough with packs that we both were glad to have used the rope. \r\nWe wandered up the long sloping plateau of Temple Crag and picked out a nice bivy spot to make camp. We enjoyed a leisurely dinner, watching the spectacular alpenglow cast upon Middle Palisade, Norman Clyde Peak, and the Palisade Crest. Tony had never camped out high like this before, and this was his first time in the Palisades, so this was quite a treat! Sure it was more effort to camp here than the lakes, but I think it was worth it.\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;hr&gt;\r\n&lt;hr&gt;\r\n&lt;h2&gt;\r\n&lt;a name=\"TOC-September-30---Climbing-Time\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;September 30 - Climbing Time&lt;/h2&gt;\r\n\r\nWe were up long before sunrise. We ate breakfast, picked our way down to the Contact Pass rappel, and made it to the base of the Lower Buttress shortly after it was bright enough to turn our headlamps off. It was really cold in the shade, so it was nice to do a few hundred feet of scrambling to warm up and delay the harder climbing until the rock was a bit warmer.\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"http://lh6.ggpht.com/-f5GIoVDVzKY/UGvzKYall7I/AAAAAAABamg/AK7zrV-UuVA/s2000/2012-09-30%252520-%25252001%252520-%252520Starting%252520Dark%252520Star%252520Low%252520Pitches.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"http://lh6.ggpht.com/-f5GIoVDVzKY/UGvzKYall7I/AAAAAAABamg/AK7zrV-UuVA/s640/2012-09-30%252520-%25252001%252520-%252520Starting%252520Dark%252520Star%252520Low%252520Pitches.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Tony starting the solo of the lower pitches of Dark Star.

Nothing bad, but nothing great, either. If you have time and Dark Star\'s main route doesn\'t have enough pitches for you, or you care about the aesthetics of a direct line, then take this start.

So cold in the morning shade.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\nBoth of us thought that the crux was pretty hard for 5.10b/c! It was also very different in character than the other arete routes. This was more like a sport route as there was very little jamming and the rock was steep, smooth, and required a lot of stemming with occasional little crimpers and edges. \r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"http://lh4.ggpht.com/-eKyegLInsVU/UGvzpYyn7hI/AAAAAAABanA/93ZqWEGuaYE/s2000/2012-09-30%252520-%25252009%252520-%252520Following%252520P2.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"http://lh4.ggpht.com/-eKyegLInsVU/UGvzpYyn7hI/AAAAAAABanA/93ZqWEGuaYE/s640/2012-09-30%252520-%25252009%252520-%252520Following%252520P2.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Following P2 of Dark Star. Topo called this 5.8, but it felt more like 5.9-5.10a to me and only slightly easier than P1. Croft indicates the 5.10c crux more in this area than lower down on P1.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\nOriginally I thought I might lead P3 (5.9 according to Moynier  &amp;amp; Fiddler\'s topo). However, as their topo indicated P2 as 5.8, which felt much harder to me, I had my doubts about being fast on the 5.9 and speed was a paramount concern for today. So Tony the rope gun launched off. Surprisingly, he had a much slower and uncertain time on the crux of this pitch. \r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"http://lh6.ggpht.com/-FTPQ75SVSQA/UGvzs3oH0XI/AAAAAAABanE/PX3fzIGZTWY/s2000/2012-09-30%252520-%25252010%252520-%252520Following%252520P3.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"http://lh6.ggpht.com/-FTPQ75SVSQA/UGvzs3oH0XI/AAAAAAABanE/PX3fzIGZTWY/s640/2012-09-30%252520-%25252010%252520-%252520Following%252520P3.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Following P3.

It looked harder to bypass than it turned out to be. The 5.9 corner after was a surprise though! Because we had brought a light rack, Tony had already used the only cam size that would protect this, so he had to use a nut in the parallel crack. The crack was so thin I could barely shove my fingertips in to the first knuckle and the moves were reach and physical to reach the next few jams were I could get my fingers in. Tony\'s hands are smaller than mine, and he had the same problem. Croft\'s topo rates this 5.10a and I\'d say that is more accurate than Moynier  &amp;amp; Fiddler\'s 5.9 rating.\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"http://lh3.ggpht.com/-nOLosZ4-eF4/UGvzzx_cqKI/AAAAAAABanM/JXwiw10ue54/s2000/2012-09-30%252520-%25252012%252520-%252520Following%252520P3%252520just%252520after%2525205_10a%252520crux.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"http://lh3.ggpht.com/-nOLosZ4-eF4/UGvzzx_cqKI/AAAAAAABanM/JXwiw10ue54/s640/2012-09-30%252520-%25252012%252520-%252520Following%252520P3%252520just%252520after%2525205_10a%252520crux.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Following P3, where the 5.10a finger crack has eased up to 5.8ish hands.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\nI took off on the next pitch of wandering 5.7 that was slightly loose.

He trailed his pack and popped back outside the chimney, offwidthing and stemming the final exposed section to a good belay ledge, where drag stopped him and he belayed me up.\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"http://lh6.ggpht.com/-otTUUVcRl90/UGvz98nPYEI/AAAAAAABank/SHgWpnoHRd8/s2000/2012-09-30%252520-%25252018%252520-%252520Tony%252520exiting%252520the%252520P5%252520chimney.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"http://lh6.ggpht.com/-otTUUVcRl90/UGvz98nPYEI/AAAAAAABank/SHgWpnoHRd8/s640/2012-09-30%252520-%25252018%252520-%252520Tony%252520exiting%252520the%252520P5%252520chimney.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Tony exiting the P5 chimney.

This is understandable as the pitch up from the notch has very few identifiable features. It is mostly a sea of steep rock with small cracks, corners, and bulges everywhere. We couldn\'t see anything \'roof-like\', but Tony took off up what looked like the best line.\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n \r\n\r\nTony linked the next two pitches in a great lead. The terrain was really steep and slightly runout and once again was mostly sport-like face climbing rather than jamming cracks. Supposedly P10 was 5.6 turning to 5.7 and P11 had a 5.10a roof. I guess we took the wrong line as P10 felt like 5.8 right off the ledge, had sparse pro, no wide crack (indicated in the topo) and there was a 5.10a/b-ish crux, but there was nothing roof-like encountered. The crux, at the end, was more like a shallow corner passing through a very steep, almost overhanging face section, split by a strange finger crack that you could sort of jam, but not really.\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"http://lh3.ggpht.com/-1qb05FqGiA8/UGv0Q66YL_I/AAAAAAABaoc/qU5FATIxSOw/s2000/2012-09-30%252520-%25252032%252520-%252520Tony%252520leading%252520P10-P11.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"http://lh3.ggpht.com/-1qb05FqGiA8/UGv0Q66YL_I/AAAAAAABaoc/qU5FATIxSOw/s640/2012-09-30%252520-%25252032%252520-%252520Tony%252520leading%252520P10-P11.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Tony leading P10-P11. We never found the 5.6-5.7 terrain of P10, and we never found the 5.7 wide or 5.10a roof of P11. We did find pretty sustained face climbing with semi-runout pro! Crux felt about 5.10ish face  &amp;amp; fingers. This also has some loose bits and the belayer is in the line of fire (yikes!).&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"http://lh6.ggpht.com/-2ScFqRhqXPo/UGv0XfLxqeI/AAAAAAABaok/PET7vuGtBIo/s2000/2012-09-30%252520-%25252034%252520-%252520Eroded%252520Rock%252520Pocket%252520on%252520Dark%252520Star.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"http://lh6.ggpht.com/-2ScFqRhqXPo/UGv0XfLxqeI/AAAAAAABaok/PET7vuGtBIo/s640/2012-09-30%252520-%25252034%252520-%252520Eroded%252520Rock%252520Pocket%252520on%252520Dark%252520Star.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Eroded dike pocket on Dark Star.

The climbing started off very loose, so I traversed a lot on the beginning so that if I knocked any rocks down they would be less likely to land on the rope or Tony.\r\n\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"http://lh4.ggpht.com/-GF6TLZJ08IA/UGv0a27hkVI/AAAAAAABaoo/DQSYXWNH6Sw/s2000/2012-09-30%252520-%25252035%252520-%252520P11%2525205th%252520class%252520loose%252520crud.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"http://lh4.ggpht.com/-GF6TLZJ08IA/UGv0a27hkVI/AAAAAAABaoo/DQSYXWNH6Sw/s640/2012-09-30%252520-%25252035%252520-%252520P11%2525205th%252520class%252520loose%252520crud.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Leading P12, loose junky 5th class.

The Sandy Notch was nowhere in sight, just sandy sloping slabs and ledges in the gully. This also reminded me of the lousy end of Sun Ribbon Arete. It seems anticlimactic to finish a spectacular knife edge ridge climb by scrambling up an easy gully, but it felt so contrived to get back onto the remaining ridge crest, and having climbed so many pitches to reach this point I suspect most climbers lose the motivation to do so. \r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n \r\n\r\nDue to darkness, we decided to just get the route over with so we finished by climbing up the cliffs to the left of the final ridge after reaching the major notch in the ridge between the Middle and Upper buttresses. \r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"http://lh4.ggpht.com/-3YFZqhLINAQ/UGv1idP_ivI/AAAAAAABaqI/BQG_sHQcEZ8/s2000/2012-09-30%252520-%25252057%252520-%252520Final%252520bowl%252520to%252520finish%252520route.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"http://lh4.ggpht.com/-3YFZqhLINAQ/UGv1idP_ivI/AAAAAAABaqI/BQG_sHQcEZ8/s640/2012-09-30%252520-%25252057%252520-%252520Final%252520bowl%252520to%252520finish%252520route.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;The final bowl to finish as it got dark.

Most of the finish was class 2 with bits of class 3. Although it was dark when we topped out, we were merely 100 ft away from our camp.

In order to traverse to Gayley with overnight packs and the amount of water we had with us, we should have at least gone a bit beyond the summit on the Dark Star day and then left early today. Oh well, I guess the traverse will have to wait for another day :-) \r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n \r\n\r\nWe ate a leisurely breakfast, visited the summit, and had a relaxed hike out and drive home.\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-smrwPxMzFko/UIApy4pdb-I/AAAAAAABb7I/hV8aMLsZ2Ak/s2000/2012-10-01%2520-%252000%2520-%2520Morning%2520Mad%2520Scientist%2520Hair.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-smrwPxMzFko/UIApy4pdb-I/AAAAAAABb7I/hV8aMLsZ2Ak/s640/2012-10-01%2520-%252000%2520-%2520Morning%2520Mad%2520Scientist%2520Hair.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;On the exposed downclimb from the summit of Temple Crag in the morning, complete with mad scientist bed head.

We climbed from the absolute low point to the top, and beyond!&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\nTony and I had been e-mailing back and forth all summer with plans to climb together, but interests or timing had never quite seemed to pan out. This trip came together at the last minute and it worked out great! I\'m looking forward to the next alpine outing that we can do together.\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;hr&gt;\r\n&lt;hr&gt;\r\n&lt;h2&gt;\r\n&lt;a name=\"TOC-Notes\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Notes&lt;/h2&gt;\r\n\r\nWe brought cams up to a #3, mostly singles but doubles in a few sizes, especially in the smaller range. Tony is a strong climber and didn\'t mind running things out, so if I had been leading I probably would have taken a larger rack, but still mostly bringing extras in the small cams range.\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n \r\n\r\nThe Lower Buttress is in the shade most of the day. Perhaps in summer days you will get a bit of sunshine, but expect shaded, cold climbing until one reached the crest of the Lower Buttress. From there the route stays mostly in the sun.\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n \r\n\r\nAs if the Grade V designation isn\'t enough of a hint, this is a long route, so start early, move fast, and simul or solo most of the pitches above P3. Also, the Middle Buttress is much larger and takes more time to cross than the topos lead one to believe, so don\'t get casual after the Lower Buttress like we did!\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n \r\n\r\nWhen simul-climbing the Lower Buttress, shorten the rope if simul-climbing before the chimney. After the chimney, 60m is fine and you can simul to the base of the Middle Buttress (nice sunny lunch/nap bench). Shorten the rope to 30m for simul-climbing on the Middle Buttress - 60m is too long and drag will eat you up and force some belays.\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n \r\n\r\nThe rappels can all be downclimbed at 5.6 or less, with reasonably solid rock - however routefinding to do so is tricky if you\'re not used to simul-climbing complex alpine ridges.\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n \r\n\r\nI only know of two topos for this route - the one from Moynier  &amp;amp; Fiddler\'s great guidebook, \"Climbing California\'s High Sierra: The Classic Climbs on Rock and Ice\", and the one from Peter Croft\'s guidebook \"The Good, The Great, and the Awesome\". While Croft\'s topo is less detailed and clean, I\'d say it is the more accurate and informative topo and does not mislead one into thinking the simul-climbing distances are shorter than they are. We didn\'t bring that one along but looking at it after the climb, I wish we had! \r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n \r\n\r\nLooking on SuperTopo, it appears that Chris McNamara and Brock Wagstaff have basically combined and improved upon these two topos. So the best and most complete one I\'ve seen is found at the link below:\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;(&lt;a href=\"http://www.wagstaffarchitects.com/climbing/darkstartopo.pdf\"&gt;Dark Star Topo&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/b&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;i&gt;Only suggestion is on P14, you can also go left of the crest on cl. 3-5, and it misses the 5.10  &amp;amp; 5.8 variations that finish on the upper buttress. Also, I thought P2 was harder than 5.8 (maybe because my hands were cold and I was tired from the long pitch?), P7 was easier than 5.8, and on P6, climbing out on the face is optional and for knowing the technique the chimney was more like 5.6-5.7, including the finish if you stay in the crack.&lt;/i&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;hr&gt;\r\n&lt;hr&gt;\r\n&lt;h2&gt;\r\n&lt;a name=\"TOC-Links\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Links&lt;/h2&gt;\r\n&lt;ul&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"https://picasaweb.google.com/105894936663116565516/20120929to1001DarkStarWithTonyNguyenV510c16P?authuser=0&amp;amp;feat=directlink\"&gt;Picasa Album&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"http://www.supertopo.com/tr/A-Fall-Day-on-Dark-Star-Sit-Start-Variation/t11734n.html\"&gt;SuperTopo TR&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;/ul&gt;\r\n&lt;/div&gt; \r\n'),(79,63,'/mountaineering/trip-reports/california/mt-whitney-e-buttress','Mt Whitney (E Buttress)','Mt Whitney, East Buttress (aka.

Peewee Route) (III, 5.8 var., 11P)&lt;/h1&gt;\r\n\r\n\r\nJared Wood and I headed up to the Whitney Zone for a long weekend of climbing. We drove straight from work Friday to the trailhead, started hiking right away, cached our camping gear at Iceberg Lake, and then climbed the East Buttress (III, 5.8 var., 11P). All in all it was a +7,000 ft gain day with over 1,000 ft of technical climbing! We slept a bit on the summit and then passed out at Iceberg Lake. We had intended to camp on the west side of the crest, so the next morning we moved camp over the crest on our way to climb Mt Russell\'s Fishook Arete.\r\n&lt;div&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;/div&gt;\r\n&lt;div&gt;Overall the East Buttress was a pretty nice route. It only has a couple sections of 5.7 and otherwise is mostly 4th to low 5th class and is good for simul-climbing. For more challenge we took the harder 5.8 start, which we soloed a good ways up before even needing to rope up. By those numbers, I led P1-2, 5, 7 &amp;amp; 8-9 simul, while Jared led P3-4 (with some simuling) and the P6 Peewee pitch. This would be a good beginner 5.7 alpine route for a novice 5.7 alpine leader as the routefinding is straightforward, rock is good, and is very well protected apart from a semi-runout bit on the P3 5.7 grooves. Oddly when I did this route, I didn\'t like it as much as the East Face even though it was more sustained. I felt like it was just hard enough to mostly pitch out, but just easy enough that pitching it out was tedious, while the East Face went much faster as we simul-climbed most of it.&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/--CU-4gJnpL8/TojTGBkEuYI/AAAAAAABGr8/pu-hrFkAMnc/s2000/2011-09-29%2520-%252012%2520-%2520Whitney%2520at%2520Sunrise%2520-%2520annotated%2520-%2520E%2520Butt.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"\" src=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/--CU-4gJnpL8/TojTGBkEuYI/AAAAAAABGr8/pu-hrFkAMnc/s800/2011-09-29%2520-%252012%2520-%2520Whitney%2520at%2520Sunrise%2520-%2520annotated%2520-%2520E%2520Butt.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;East Buttress of Mount Whitney with the major starting variations.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-rAeFtUvSMlg/T7H_WRAYewI/AAAAAAABEJ8/ZC8Wq50Y7mw/s1600/2012-05-11%252520-%25252001%252520-%252520Water%252520Ice%252520Above%252520Lower%252520Boy%252520Scout%252520Lake.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"\" src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-rAeFtUvSMlg/T7H_WRAYewI/AAAAAAABEJ8/ZC8Wq50Y7mw/s800/2012-05-11%252520-%25252001%252520-%252520Water%252520Ice%252520Above%252520Lower%252520Boy%252520Scout%252520Lake.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Still some ice to be had above Lower Boy Scout Lake.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-4RMwLmKoUKc/T7H_W2acIvI/AAAAAAABEKA/BgPqb0YQS4s/s1600/2012-05-11%252520-%25252002%252520-%252520Nearing%252520Upper%252520Boy%252520Scout%252520Lake.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"\" src=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-4RMwLmKoUKc/T7H_W2acIvI/AAAAAAABEKA/BgPqb0YQS4s/s800/2012-05-11%252520-%25252002%252520-%252520Nearing%252520Upper%252520Boy%252520Scout%252520Lake.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Sunrise as we neared Upper Boy Scout Lake.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-5GuyogfNt28/T7H_XStdHdI/AAAAAAABGfM/XoFWJu6K7Ew/s1600/2012-05-11%252520-%25252003%252520-%252520Mt%252520Whitney%252520from%252520Iceberg%252520Lake.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"\" src=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-5GuyogfNt28/T7H_XStdHdI/AAAAAAABGfM/XoFWJu6K7Ew/s800/2012-05-11%252520-%25252003%252520-%252520Mt%252520Whitney%252520from%252520Iceberg%252520Lake.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Mt Whitney &amp;amp; the various \'Needles\' from Iceberg Lake.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-pnFTve3xr6I/T7H_abakB_I/AAAAAAABEKM/kG8W5yHHE10/s1600/2012-05-11%252520-%25252005%252520-%252520E%252520Buttress%252520-%252520Soloing%252520First%252520Half%252520of%252520P1.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"\" src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-pnFTve3xr6I/T7H_abakB_I/AAAAAAABEKM/kG8W5yHHE10/s800/2012-05-11%252520-%25252005%252520-%252520E%252520Buttress%252520-%252520Soloing%252520First%252520Half%252520of%252520P1.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Soloing the first half of P1 for the 5.8 variation.

The following morning we would wake early to move camp over the crest for better views of Mt Russell and for climbing the classic Fishhook Arete.&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;hr&gt;\r\n&lt;hr&gt;\r\n&lt;h2&gt;\r\n&lt;a name=\"TOC-Links\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Links&lt;/h2&gt;\r\n&lt;div&gt;\r\n&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://picasaweb.google.com/105894936663116565516/20120511MtWhitneyEButtWJaredWoodIII5711P?authuser=0&amp;amp;feat=directlink\"&gt;Picasa Album&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;\r\n&lt;/div&gt;\r\n&lt;/div&gt;\r\n&lt;hr&gt;\r\n&lt;hr&gt;\r\n&lt;h2&gt;\r\n&lt;a name=\"TOC-Continued:-Mt-Russell-Fishhook-Arete-III-5.9-8P-\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Continued: &lt;a href=\"http://www.markpthomas.com/mountaineering/trip-reports/california/mt-russell-fishhook-arete\"&gt;Mt Russell, Fishhook Arete (III, 5.9, 8P)&lt;/a&gt;\r\n&lt;/h2&gt;\r\n&lt;/div&gt; \r\n'),(80,64,'/mountaineering/trip-reports/california/mt-whitney-e-face','Mt Whitney (E Face)','Mt Whitney, East Face (III, 5.7, 13P)','Trip_Report','content: &lt;div dir=\"ltr\"&gt;\r\n&lt;h1&gt;\r\n&lt;a name=\"TOC-Mt-Whitney-East-Face-III-5.7-13P-\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Mt Whitney, East Face (III, 5.7, 13P)&lt;/h1&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-lwg5VT2KrNc/TojTHF4SLDI/AAAAAAAA2-E/p19N18qrFT4/s2000/2011-09-29%2520-%252012%2520-%2520Whitney%2520at%2520Sunrise%2520-%2520annotated%2520-%2520East%2520Face.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"\" src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-lwg5VT2KrNc/TojTHF4SLDI/AAAAAAAA2-E/p19N18qrFT4/s800/2011-09-29%2520-%252012%2520-%2520Whitney%2520at%2520Sunrise%2520-%2520annotated%2520-%2520East%2520Face.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;East Face of Mount Whitney with major features called out.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;table&gt;\r\n&lt;tbody&gt;\r\n&lt;tr&gt;\r\n&lt;td&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-v3ZPFZytjEc/US3QRCZfIqI/AAAAAAABr6s/M72s8f2FroY/s2000/2011-09-29%2520-%252053%2520-%2520Whitney%2520on%2520Descent%2520-%2520annotated.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-v3ZPFZytjEc/US3QRCZfIqI/AAAAAAABr6s/M72s8f2FroY/s400/2011-09-29%2520-%252053%2520-%2520Whitney%2520on%2520Descent%2520-%2520annotated.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;/td&gt;\r\n&lt;td&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-RNoloQgkW3Y/US3QQG_wImI/AAAAAAABr6k/MaP-4btk-gE/s2000/2011-09-29%2520-%252010%2520-%2520Whitney%2520at%2520Sunrise%2520-%2520annotated.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"\" src=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-RNoloQgkW3Y/US3QQG_wImI/AAAAAAABr6k/MaP-4btk-gE/s400/2011-09-29%2520-%252010%2520-%2520Whitney%2520at%2520Sunrise%2520-%2520annotated.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;/td&gt;\r\n&lt;/tr&gt;\r\n&lt;/tbody&gt;\r\n&lt;/table&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;East Face of Mount Whitney with the East Face &amp;amp; East Buttress Routes.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\nVitaliy and I climbed the East Face of Mt Whitney car-to-car.

The Mountaineer\'s route was snowy &amp;amp; icy and with my tweaked knee I didn\'t make it down to the TH until about 9pm.

I hadn\'t brought anything more than a jacket to wear inside, but that was plenty to sleep comfortably.

I ended at the base of a slightly dirty chimney where there is an optional belay, but as any rocks knocked down would land on the belayer, I climbed the chimney to a spot above. Take care to watch out for rope drag to be able to do this.&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-cAVy2OlNC-M/TojRUT8pCfI/AAAAAAAA280/KLa7NYj508s/s1600/2011-09-29%252520-%25252036%252520-%252520Dirty%2525205_7%252520Chimney%252520P8.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"\" src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-cAVy2OlNC-M/TojRUT8pCfI/AAAAAAAA280/KLa7NYj508s/s800/2011-09-29%252520-%25252036%252520-%252520Dirty%2525205_7%252520Chimney%252520P8.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;The slightly dirty 5.7 chimney on P8.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-t8Tfb-pJ0y4/TojRVOl9wqI/AAAAAAAA284/M992UBG6MJE/s1600/2011-09-29%252520-%25252037%252520-%252520Looking%252520down%252520from%252520P8.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"\" src=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-t8Tfb-pJ0y4/TojRVOl9wqI/AAAAAAAA284/M992UBG6MJE/s800/2011-09-29%252520-%25252037%252520-%252520Looking%252520down%252520from%252520P8.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Looking down from the belay atop P8.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n  Next Vitaliy swung leads past me onto the Grand Staircase.

I had occasionally heard the &amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#156;Challenge&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#157; mentioned on the internet over the past 2 years that I had been in California, but I didn&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;t think that I had the stamina to participate.  After I climbed the 9,600 ft West Ridge of White Mountain earlier that spring, Bob suggested I try my hand at the Challenge. With this validation of ability, I decided to go for it.  \r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\nEven though I had the strength and stamina to ascend over 8,000 ft in a day and climb for multiple days in a row, I still knew that at the time that I couldn&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;t keep up with the brutal pace of the Sierra Challenge, which lasts for 10 uninterrupted days, covering about 15-20 miles of hiking/climbing with an average of 5,500ft of elevation gain for each day. According to Bob, each day of the Challenge was &amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#156;Not unlike climbing Half Dome, but more off-trail, more technically demanding, and at higher elevation&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#157;. In fact, the peaks all ranged from 12,500 ft to 13,700 ft in height, so acclimatization was an additional obstacle.  \r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\nIn June I moved back to Salt Lake City in order to earn enough money to finish my schooling at UC Berkeley, and this proved to be very beneficial to my training.  Since I was working about half the week, I made sure to get out hiking in the Wasatch Mountains for the other half. By the time I headed to California I had hiked around 95 miles and ascended some 40,000 feet since June. The day to day hiking on steep trails and cross country above 8,000 ft whipped me into shape and had me well acclimatized. I knew that I at least had a chance of completing most of the event.  \r\n\r\n&lt;h2&gt;\r\n&lt;a name=\"TOC-July-30th\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;July 30th&lt;/h2&gt;\r\n\r\n    Here I was, sitting outside of the Fremont BART station on a warm Friday morning, wearing a pack larger than my torso and towing an equally large suitcase. I also had an additional daypack with me stuffed full of gear, and with all of the luggage I really stood out from the crowd of typical commuters carrying purses and briefcases. Like in earlier trips, people probably wondered what sort mischief I was up to, or whether or not I was crazy, or homeless, or both!  \r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\nI didn&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;t have a car in California, but through an exchange of e-mails I managed to secure a ride with Dave Wright, one of the Sierra Challenge participants.  I had gotten familiar with Dave prior to our meeting by reading Bob&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;s trip reports, since Dave had joined him on all of the previous Challenges. Dave was an ultra-marathon runner, with a full beard and a quiet manner that made him easy to recognize when he arrived at the BART station to pick me up. From there we stopped by his place to get a few last minute items and then we were off to Yosemite.  \r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\nOn the drive to Yosemite I got to know Dave quite a bit more. He haled from Illinois, working as a university researcher in chemistry.  Later on he moved to California (why, I cannot recall), and after taking some classes from UC Berkeley, landed a job with a computer company in Silicon Valley. He was really into is running, jogging over 10 miles a day over his lunch break, but in recent years his knees had given him trouble. Partly because of this, and also because of his less-than-fanatical manner, Dave rarely kept up with Bob on the earlier Challenges. Usually he would get uncomfortable on the scrambling, or just couldn&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;t keep up the pace. Although Dave had summited few of the peaks, he would still enjoy himself on the trail at an easier pace. I expected the same from him this year as well, which helped relieve some of my anxiety as I knew that I would at least have some company on the trail if I got left behind.  \r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\nOnce we reached Yosemite, we stopped briefly for some stretching and a little scrambling on Lembert Dome, one of many granite roche moutonn&amp;Atilde;&amp;copy;es  in Yosemite. It was a steep friction walk up an ever-increasing incline of smooth granite as we arced around the mound. Luckily, Dave knew of a class 3 route that passed through territory that would otherwise be low 5th class rock.   \r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\nUpon reaching the top some 500 vertical feet above where we had begun, we were treated to a panoramic view of Toulomne Meadows, with tiny Pothole Dome to the west, Mt Dana to the east, and Mt Maclure and Lyell seemingly floating in the horizon above their glaciers far to the south. These last two peaks would be our day hike objective on the second day of the challenge and they looked impossibly distant for such an endeavor.  \r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\nAfter savoring the views and sharing some food with some adventurous tourists, we descended the steeper north side of the dome, descending a depression beginning at a cleft in the rock that continues through the cliffs to the forest below. This route was steeper then the other one, and the few loose rocks kicked splattered on the trees below &amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#147; best to be careful here, even though the climbing was class 3.  \r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\nAbout 15 minutes later we reached the car and drove across the Yosemite Border to some free camping on the far side of Tioga Pass &amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#147; the famed Camp 9 that I had heard so much about. An aptly named camp at 9,000 ft just off the road descending from the pass, Camp 9 is a lightly maintained campground with picnic tables located about 100 yards down a trail from a locked gate at one of the switchbacks of the paved highway. It is a walk-in campsite used mostly by climbers, and it is the perfect place for cheap lodging and a night&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;s acclimatization before any hike or climb in the area. There I filled my water bottles,  organized my climbing rack , reviewed Mountaineering: Freedom of the Hills on rappels and gear placement, and then turned in early for the night so as to be well rested for our 6am departure time at the trailhead the next day.\r\n&lt;div&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;/div&gt;\r\n&lt;div&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;/div&gt;\r\n&lt;div&gt;\r\n&lt;div&gt;\r\n&lt;hr&gt;\r\n&lt;hr&gt;\r\n&lt;h2&gt;\r\n&lt;a name=\"TOC-Links\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Links&lt;/h2&gt;\r\n&lt;ul&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://www.snwburd.com/bob/challenge/2004/\"&gt;Bob Burd\'s Sierra Challenge TR &amp;amp; Photos&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://www.summitpost.org/my-first-sierra-challenge-2004/169860\"&gt;SummitPost TR&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;/ul&gt;\r\n&lt;/div&gt;\r\n&lt;hr&gt;\r\n&lt;hr&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"http://www.markpthomas.com/mountaineering/trip-reports/california/my-first-sierra-challenge-2004\"&gt;2004 Sierra Challenge&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"http://www.markpthomas.com/mountaineering/trip-reports/california/nw-ridge-of-n-pk-and-n-ridge-of-mt-conness\"&gt;Day 1: North Peak &amp;amp; Mt Conness&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"http://www.markpthomas.com/mountaineering/trip-reports/california/mt-lyell-mt-maclure\"&gt;Day 2: Mt Lyell &amp;amp; Mt Maclure&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"http://www.markpthomas.com/mountaineering/trip-reports/california/basin-mtn-e-chute\"&gt;Day 4: Basin Mtn - Four Gables Traverse&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"http://www.markpthomas.com/mountaineering/trip-reports/california/mt-haeckel-mt-wallace\"&gt;Day 5: Mt Haeckel &amp;amp; Mt Wallace&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"http://www.markpthomas.com/mountaineering/trip-reports/california/mt-winchell-e-arete\"&gt;Day 6: Mt Winchell&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"http://www.markpthomas.com/mountaineering/trip-reports/california/mt-jepson-palisade-crest\"&gt;Day 7: Palisade Crest &amp;amp; Mt Jepson&lt;/a&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;/div&gt;\r\n&lt;div&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;/div&gt;\r\n&lt;div&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;/div&gt;\r\n&lt;/div&gt; \r\n'),(82,68,'/mountaineering/trip-reports/california/nw-ridge-of-n-pk-and-n-ridge-of-mt-conness','Day 1: North Peak &amp; Mt Conness','2004 Sierra Challenge - Day 1: North Peak &amp; Mt Conness','Trip_Report','content: &lt;div dir=\"ltr\"&gt;\r\n&lt;h1&gt;\r\n&lt;a name=\"TOC-2004-Sierra-Challenge---Day-1:-North-Peak-Mt-Conness\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;2004 Sierra Challenge - Day 1: North Peak &amp;amp; Mt Conness&lt;/h1&gt;\r\n&lt;h2&gt;\r\n&lt;a name=\"TOC-July-31-2004\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;July 31, 2004&lt;/h2&gt;\r\n&lt;hr&gt;\r\n&lt;hr&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;&lt;table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"2\" cellspacing=\"1\"&gt;\r\n&lt;tbody&gt;\r\n&lt;tr&gt;\r\n&lt;td width=\"40%\"&gt;\r\n&lt;font color=\"BLUE\"&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;b&gt;Stats&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/font&gt;\r\n&lt;ul&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;Routes:&lt;/b&gt; North Pk via &lt;a href=\"http://www.summitpost.org/show/route_link.pl/route_id/3546/object_id/495\"&gt;Northwest Ridge&lt;/a&gt;, Conness via &lt;a href=\"http://www.summitpost.org/show/route_link.pl/route_id/841/object_id/335\"&gt;North Ridge&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"http://www.summitpost.org/show/route_link.pl/route_id/258/object_id/335\"&gt;East Ridge&lt;/a&gt;\r\n&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;Elevation Gained:&lt;/b&gt; 4,126\'  \r\n&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;RT Distance:&lt;/b&gt; 10 mi  \r\n&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;RT Time:&lt;/b&gt; 9hr 30min&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;Trailhead:&lt;/b&gt; Saddlebag Lake  \r\n&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;Summit Elevs.:&lt;/b&gt; North Pk: 12,242\'   Mt Conness: 12,590\'  \r\n&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;Rating:&lt;/b&gt; III, 5.6  \r\n&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;/ul&gt;\r\n&lt;/td&gt;\r\n&lt;td&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-S45QQ6jVVoA/UMzdRpsABGI/AAAAAAABkyg/dy_Hmok_n2M/s2000/MtConness-Jul31-04-13Joel%252CDave%252C%2526MtConness.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img height=\"200\" src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-S45QQ6jVVoA/UMzdRpsABGI/AAAAAAABkyg/dy_Hmok_n2M/s600/MtConness-Jul31-04-13Joel%252CDave%252C%2526MtConness.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;/td&gt;\r\n&lt;/tr&gt;\r\n&lt;/tbody&gt;\r\n&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;hr&gt;\r\n&lt;hr&gt;\r\n&lt;h2&gt;\r\n&lt;a name=\"TOC-Northwest-Ridge-of-North-Peak\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Northwest Ridge of North Peak&lt;/h2&gt;\r\n\r\n\r\n  The sun was barely rising and the temperature was just climbing above 40&lt;sup&gt;o&lt;/sup&gt;F, but already there was a flurry of activity at the Saddlebag Lake trailhead. There were 13 people signed up for today, making it the largest Sierra Challenge gathering to date, and everyone showed up. Most of the people were planning on climbing Mt Conness via the class 3 East Ridge.  I had already done this route before as a descent from climbing the West Ridge, so I was up for something different.  \r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\nI would be joining Bob and some other die-hards on climbing Mt Conness via the North Ridge, which is rated 5.6. Joining me on this route was Sam Mills, whom I had climbed with up the Crescent Couloir on Round Top in the Spring, and Joel Wilson, a fellow Cal student who I had done many mountaineering trips with.     \r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\nAlthough the 5.6 rating was for the downclimb from two gendarmes  midway along the ridge, there was still class 4-5 scrambling leading up to them and between them and the summit. Everyone attempting this route was going to free-solo  it apart from rappelling off the gendarmes, which made me uncomfortable since one would be committed to finishing the route after that point, and I wasn&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;t sure how well I would handle the exposure. Luckily Michael Graupe had agreed to join me on the route, giving us the option to set up a roped belay beyond the rappel if needed. He carried the rope, and I carried all of the pro .   \r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\nTrue to the trip reports I read of earlier Sierra Challenges, Bob set off 10 minutes after the starting time. The pace wasn&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;t too bad, but then again, we were on a nice, flat trail at the beginning of the day. Michael and I were probably carrying the heaviest packs of the day, but I managed to keep up just fine. Soon we left the main trail and continued along a series of faint use-trails  that wound their way up the boulder-strewn meadows as we climbed higher above tree-line, dropping occasionally into a pristine lake or creek as we ascended.  \r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\nFor those of us heading to Conness&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153; North Ridge, Bob had planned to also include North Peak as an extra goodie along the route. On the topos he provided online he showed us ascending the class 3 east slope, but when I matched up the peak with the map, I was confused, since it appeared that we were instead heading towards the north ridge of the peak. I guess Bob had a change of plans.&amp;Acirc;&amp;nbsp;&amp;Acirc;&amp;nbsp;&lt;div&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-hyqlHw9yLFQ/UMzdGqfSXxI/AAAAAAABkxI/WymT9aboJic/s2000/MtConness-Jul31-04-1NPeak.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-hyqlHw9yLFQ/UMzdGqfSXxI/AAAAAAABkxI/WymT9aboJic/s600/MtConness-Jul31-04-1NPeak.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;North Peak seen from the approach to the Northwest Ridge&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\nOnce we reached the ridgeline the fun began. It was enjoyable class 2-3 scrambling along ridgeline slabs with some spicy exposure on both sides. Spicy &amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#147; I hadn&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;t heard this term used before in climbing, but it soon became a part of my lexicon. Along the route we reached 3 notches that forced us onto some ledges on the side of the ridge. Each one of us found a different way to bypass these obstacles, and on one I found an enjoyable 10 ft crack that provided some fun 5th class climbing. The second notch forced us onto some class 4 sloping slabs on the west side of the ridge, before ascending the far side of the notch on the ridge&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;s east side.&amp;Acirc;&amp;nbsp;&lt;div&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;&lt;table border=\"0\" width=\"200\"&gt;\r\n&lt;tbody&gt;\r\n&lt;tr&gt;\r\n&lt;td&gt;&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-YW5cy7Ew4sg/UMzdM0qY5mI/AAAAAAABkx4/QrzrBr0KZeI/s2000/MtConness-Jul31-04-8Crux.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-YW5cy7Ew4sg/UMzdM0qY5mI/AAAAAAABkx4/QrzrBr0KZeI/s400/MtConness-Jul31-04-8Crux.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;The most exposed part of the Northwest Ridge.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\r\n&lt;td&gt;&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-qM6hIRaMSZY/UMzdNyHwMBI/AAAAAAABkyA/bk8l6G3eQLA/s2000/MtConness-Jul31-04-9Crux.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-qM6hIRaMSZY/UMzdNyHwMBI/AAAAAAABkyA/bk8l6G3eQLA/s400/MtConness-Jul31-04-9Crux.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;The most exposed part of the Northwest Ridge.

Besides being steep, below the ledges was a vertical drop some several hundred feet to the glacier below. Luckily the rock was solid and the pitch was short, and soon I was above it. From this point on there was a tedious and sandy class 2 slope up the final 200 vertical feet to the summit, and soon I was standing on top. It was only 8:30 am, but already I was standing at an elevation of 12,242 ft &amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#147; not much further to go to the summit of Conness!. At this point I was in the middle of the two main groups that had formed out of our North Ridge party, so I had some time to sign the summit register and enjoy the awesome view the North Peak summit provided of the North Ridge of Mt Conness. The class 4 ridge leading up to the first gendarme looked intimidating, but also exciting.&amp;Acirc;&amp;nbsp;&amp;Acirc;&amp;nbsp;&lt;div&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-C0evj01rgk4/UMzdO0BgmrI/AAAAAAABkyI/1TSLF5cUDvo/s2000/MtConness-Jul31-04-10MtConnessFromNorthPk.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-C0evj01rgk4/UMzdO0BgmrI/AAAAAAABkyI/1TSLF5cUDvo/s600/MtConness-Jul31-04-10MtConnessFromNorthPk.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;The North Ridge of Mt Conness from the south slopes of North Pk.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;h2&gt;\r\n&lt;a name=\"TOC-North-Ridge-of-Mt-Conness\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;North Ridge of Mt Conness&lt;/h2&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;After a few minutes rest, Joel and I left Bob on the summit and headed off towards the col  below. From there we soon got into some very solid and thrilling scrambling across class 3-4 rock. I had had reservations about this part, but free-soloing the class 4 felt very secure. Sam Mills led the way, and soon Bob blazed past us. &lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-vJ5aqBYNNB4/UMzdT80GEmI/AAAAAAABkyw/L_OD6YLHEzc/s2000/MtConness-Jul31-04-15JoelNRidge.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-vJ5aqBYNNB4/UMzdT80GEmI/AAAAAAABkyw/L_OD6YLHEzc/s600/MtConness-Jul31-04-15JoelNRidge.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Joel Wilson on the North Ridge of Mt Conness. The route bypasses the first tower via a ledge on the north side (near side in the photo). The second tower is the leftmost one in the photo.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n  From the top of the first gendarme the route finding got more difficult, but we soon found the easy class 2 ledge described in earlier trip reports. It was narrow and hard to find at first, since it cut cleanly across the vertical 1,000 ft face of the east side of Conness&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153; North Ridge. Luckily it proved easy to cross. Many a climber before had mistakenly rappelled off of the first gendarme, only to have wasted time getting to the second one, and this shortcut saved us some difficulty.&amp;Acirc;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;\r\n&lt;div&gt;&amp;Acirc;&amp;nbsp;  &lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-hc1rlDxsBc0/UMzdXNnFrnI/AAAAAAABkzI/ePldBkfphnQ/s2000/MtConness-Jul31-04-18SecondTower.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-hc1rlDxsBc0/UMzdXNnFrnI/AAAAAAABkzI/ePldBkfphnQ/s600/MtConness-Jul31-04-18SecondTower.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;The second tower seen from the top of the first tower. Take the jumbled ledge to the left to bypass the obstacle of the first tower.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n  By the time I reached the second gendarme Bob and some of the others had already begun attempting to down climb the 5.6 route down the backside.  They made it down about 15 ft to a ledge before they decided that it was a little too much for them to free climb. Michael got out the rope and we fixed our first rappel for the route. While doing so I noticed that some people were already halfway up the North Ridge, soloing very close to the edge.  The route looked very intimidating &amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#147; a practically vertical face, yet the climbers ahead of us seemed to stick to it easily.  \r\n  &lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n  Joel had caught up by this time and he felt confident that he could free-solo the route, but since he hadn&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;t planned on this beforehand he had no harness to use for a rappel.. Luckily I had brought a 30 ft piece of webbing to use for an anchor, and I quickly fashioned a Swiss Seat for him.  \r\n  &lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n  The rappel was straightforward and ended on a surprisingly non-threatening ledge. From earlier photos I had seen of the route this ledge looked very exposed, but it was nothing more than a series of granite ledges with a gravelly slope with some room to walk around.  I waited here to collect my rope, as well as to help coach Matthew Holliman down the rope. Apparently he had had a bad experience rappelling on Lone Pine Peak earlier that year and was more than a little tense.   \r\n  &lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n  I continued on to the next rappel and then set off on my own route up the western side of the North Ridge.  There were many variations possible and I was able to keep the exposure at a level that I was comfortable with by constantly following some diagonally ascending ledges to gain height and then cutting back towards the ridge.  The rock was solid and provided a fun variety of climbing &amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#147; some face climbing here, a few foot and hand jambs there.  Staying further away from the ridge, the climbing was more like 4th class with a little low 5th class intermixed.   \r\n  &lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-9zK9mllW-cc/UMzdWA8l7LI/AAAAAAABkzA/VxG85-Xzcas/s2000/MtConness-Jul31-04-17Joel.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-9zK9mllW-cc/UMzdWA8l7LI/AAAAAAABkzA/VxG85-Xzcas/s600/MtConness-Jul31-04-17Joel.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Joel heading up the final portion of the ridge below the first tower.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n  Although I was still a little tense from the exposure, I had a great time and soon I was at the end of the ridge.  From there I could look back on the route. It was covered with people climbing every which way. I could also see another team of climbers topping out on the West Ridge. It seemed that Mt Conness was being attacked by a horde of ants!  I doubt the peak has ever seen this much traffic on the North Ridge at one time, much less combined with climbers topping out on the other routes.  \r\n  &lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;&lt;table border=\"0\" width=\"200\"&gt;\r\n&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;\r\n&lt;td&gt;&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-nIQntaX_AvA/UMzdY8GecJI/AAAAAAABkzY/GtABL6oUKOI/s2000/MtConness-Jul31-04-20NRidge.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-nIQntaX_AvA/UMzdY8GecJI/AAAAAAABkzY/GtABL6oUKOI/s600/MtConness-Jul31-04-20NRidge.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;The North Ridge of Mt Conness seen from atop the 2nd Gendarme.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\r\n&lt;td&gt;&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-5YZ4ftE7SRk/UMzdcONDvbI/AAAAAAABkzw/mLGAtZ9bRAM/s2000/MtConness-Jul31-04-23ClimbersOnNRidge.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-5YZ4ftE7SRk/UMzdcONDvbI/AAAAAAABkzw/mLGAtZ9bRAM/s600/MtConness-Jul31-04-23ClimbersOnNRidge.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Climbers on the North Ridge of Mt Conness seen from the base of the rappel (or 5.6 downclimb).&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\r\n&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;\r\n&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-xvBlogsRNMo/UMzdbaXqhzI/AAAAAAABkzo/GtOaYo6kpDM/s2000/MtConness-Jul31-04-22NRidge.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-xvBlogsRNMo/UMzdbaXqhzI/AAAAAAABkzo/GtOaYo6kpDM/s600/MtConness-Jul31-04-22NRidge.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;The North Ridge of Mt Conness seen from the base of the rappel (or 5.6 downclimb).

I waited a long while on the summit for Michael after everyone left &amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#147; I had left my Gatorade with him earlier on the climb and I wanted it back!  Eventually I gave up and headed down the familiar East Ridge. I had descended this route nearly a year ago after a night spent &lt;a href=\"http://www.markpthomas.com/mountaineering/trip-reports/california/mark-n-dirk-s-bivouac-trilogy---part-1-mt-conness\"&gt;climbing the West Ridge with Dirk&lt;/a&gt;.  I scrambled down some sandy ledges and walked across the sidewalk-width spine of the ridge near the plateau. It was a steep vertical drop off on both sides, offering beautiful views of the mountain. This section was short &amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#147; maybe 20 to 30 feet. Then I was on the high plateau. Luckily I had been here before, so I easily found the right part of the plateau edge to approach in order to head down the correct drainage.   \r\n  &lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;&lt;table border=\"0\" width=\"200\"&gt;\r\n&lt;tbody&gt;\r\n&lt;tr&gt;\r\n&lt;td&gt;&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-VUu-EdoBWVE/UMzdeI9XQ-I/AAAAAAABk0A/TkGscIfc8Z4/s2000/MtConness-Jul31-04-25NorthPk.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-VUu-EdoBWVE/UMzdeI9XQ-I/AAAAAAABk0A/TkGscIfc8Z4/s400/MtConness-Jul31-04-25NorthPk.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;North Pk seen from the East Ridge of Mt Conness.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\r\n&lt;td&gt;&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-TnWP3BA3l0s/UMzdfGiWF0I/AAAAAAABk0I/yy4MXH58qDU/s2000/MtConness-Jul31-04-26NorthPk.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-TnWP3BA3l0s/UMzdfGiWF0I/AAAAAAABk0I/yy4MXH58qDU/s400/MtConness-Jul31-04-26NorthPk.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;North Pk seen from the East Ridge of Mt Conness.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\r\n&lt;/tr&gt;\r\n&lt;/tbody&gt;\r\n&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\nI descended some unpleasant sandy class 2 ledges and then headed for the class 3 ridge route marked on the topo that Bob had posted on the internet.  The ridge had many ledges, but none seemed to last long before cliffing out. At each dead end I dropped lower and never seemed to find a good way to get back up to the ridge without a lot of route finding.  I knew that I was getting further behind the group and that I needed to get back to the trailhead before everyone left &amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#147; I wouldn&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;t have a ride out of there otherwise.  I decided to take the straightforward approach to the East Ridge route that I had taken on my last visit to Conness and dropped down from the ridge, passed by a small pond north of Alpine Lake and scrambled down the wet class 3 ledges to reach a maintained trail. Soon before reaching the Saddlebag campgrounds I cut north cross country and headed straight up some steep slopes to reach the road just short of the Saddlebag Lake trailhead. \r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\nI searched for a while and couldn&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;t find any cars that I recognized &amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#147; Dave had since left for Camp 9. Luckily Sam Mills was still around &amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#147; he had been having some trouble with his truck.

Everyone was meeting extra early today &amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#147; the trailhead start time was scheduled for 4 am to account for the extremely long distance to be covered that day.  We had a 28 mile day hike to look forward to, and it looked to be quite a grind &amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#147; during the first 8.5 miles of trail we would only gain about 500 ft of the 5,050 ft to be ascended that day.  \r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\nA lot of people showed up at the trailhead. The hike the day before had had record attendance for the Sierra Challenge, and many of the participants had come back for another beating.  \r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\nWe left at 4:10 am at a blistering pace &amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#147; Matthew Holliman was in the lead, followed by Michael Graupe and me. Michelle and others were right behind me. Hiking by headlamp became difficult at such speeds as we kicked up a lot of dust. My problem became worse as my headlamp light began to fail &amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#147; I was trying to squeeze as much life out of the batteries as I could, and I had the bad judgment to start of with this group of fast hikers without a fresh set of batteries. My light kept flashing on and off, usually at inopportune times, causing me to trip on the rocks and bridges that we crossed.  \r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\nI knew that we had a long approach to get to the cross-country travel and scrambling, and I couldn&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;t get left behind this early. If I did I would only fall further behind since I would have to do my own route finding and I wasn&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;t as familiar with the area as other were.  Since someone was still right on my heels I assumed everyone was and kept going. As I tripped left and right I left my momentum carry me along the trail, landing on my other leg and continuing to hike along, half jogging.  \r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\nWe passed through the occasional meadows in Lyell Canyon. They looked very surreal as they were bathed in the cold azure glow of the full moon. We pressed on in the dark without a word, hiking at a pace I could barely sustain, with only the sound of boots clomping along the trail &amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#147; time seemed to stand still. Meadows came and went, and in the dark everything looked the same.  Suddenly the stillness of time was broken by the yipping of coyotes somewhere out in one of the meadows &amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#147; we were certainly in wild country now.  \r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\nOddly enough it was a relief for me when we reached the first set of switchbacks. My legs were dying from the brutal pace &amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#147; I had never hiked so fast for so long in all my life. We slowed down a bit on the hill. In addition to this, my legs were further relieved by pushing upward for a change rather than forward. I&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;m used to the steep trails of the Wasatch, not flat expanses, so now I was beginning to be in my element. Heading up the hill offered a slight reprieve and I no longer felt like I would collapse &amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#147; I might keep up after all!  Soon the need to dig a cat hole became too great and I had to give up the chase. Even though everyone was still right on my tail, I just had to stop. As I dropped off the trail I noticed that Michelle wasn&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;t behind me. Dmitry seemed to be the only one following me &amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#147; no one else was in sight!   \r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\nI took care of business and was ready to head on 10 minutes later when I saw Bob Burd and some other mountain goats rushing up the trail. By this point my legs had begun to cramp up a little and I was hiking a little slower &amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#147; I had been hiking at about 4 mph for the last 2 &amp;Acirc;&amp;frac12; hours and by this time my legs were spent.  Bob soon caught up and I inquired as to whether we were going to take a brief 10 minute breather for some food at some point soon.   \r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#156;Break?!! What are you talking about? We&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;re not taking any breaks!&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#157; he chirped as he passed me. Oh boy, today was going to be a rough day.\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;h2&gt;\r\n&lt;a name=\"TOC-Mt-Lyell\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Mt Lyell&lt;/h2&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Soon we were above tree line. Just as we reached a bend in the trail at a picturesque alpine lake, Bob kept heading straight. Now we were beginning the two miles of cross country remaining before we reached the peaks. Bob and Joel Wilson had gotten ahead of me at this point, and I struggled on just to keep them in sight. They slowed down a bit as we reached the beginning of some granite slabs and our first views of Mt Maclure for the day. At one point I caught up to Bob as he stopped to photograph the bones of some deer or mountain goat. He turned to me with a grin on his face, and with a gesture towards the skeleton remarked &amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#156;Don&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;t let this happen to you!&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#157;  Perhaps that was the skeleton of one of the slower hikers on an earlier Sierra Challenge? &lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n  Bob and Joel soon gained about 100 yards on me as we headed up the seemingly endless granite slabs. I felt like I was scrambling in southern Utah as I walked up all of these rock slabs &amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#147; there was no vegetation in sight, only the smallest turf and a desert of crystalline rock.  \r\n  &lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;&lt;table border=\"0\" width=\"200\"&gt;\r\n&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;\r\n&lt;td&gt;&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-dc4omBHxDUo/UMzdhvMHiiI/AAAAAAABk0c/l43zyd3_O5I/s2000/Lyell%2526Maclure-Aug1-04-1Mt%2520MaclureFromLyellGlacier.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"\" src=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-dc4omBHxDUo/UMzdhvMHiiI/AAAAAAABk0c/l43zyd3_O5I/s400/Lyell%2526Maclure-Aug1-04-1Mt%2520MaclureFromLyellGlacier.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Maclure from Lyell Glacier&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\r\n&lt;td&gt;&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-ihR94S_3u1s/UMzdiRI80mI/AAAAAAABk0k/H0wCd4T5Yg8/s2000/Lyell%2526Maclure-Aug1-04-2MtLyellFromLyellGlacier.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"\" src=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-ihR94S_3u1s/UMzdiRI80mI/AAAAAAABk0k/H0wCd4T5Yg8/s400/Lyell%2526Maclure-Aug1-04-2MtLyellFromLyellGlacier.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Lyell from Lyell Glacier&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\r\n&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;\r\n&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=\"line-height:1.25;font-size:10pt\"&gt;I caught up with Joel at the toe of the Lyell Glacier. Bob had already rushed up the glacier, but Joel was still putting on his crampons. By this point I could see both Lyell and Maclure and the route finding seemed straightforward.  Joel and I hiked together from this point, heading up the glacier straight toward the rocky cliffs of Mt Lyell. I saw a figure stop at the bas of the cliffs and watch us for a little while. I figured it was Bob. By the time we finished cramponing up the awkward runnels on the glacier I had lost track of the figure. According to the purple line on Bob&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;s topo we were to head toward a low point in the ridge on the east side of the mountain, so Joel and I angled towards the saddle.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;&lt;table border=\"0\" width=\"200\"&gt;\r\n&lt;tbody&gt;\r\n&lt;tr&gt;\r\n&lt;td&gt;&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-Fk_wMKi5PH0/UMzdjlmTNLI/AAAAAAABk0s/mo6zG0E9tv0/s2000/Lyell%2526Maclure-Aug1-04-3JoelAtLyellEastCol.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-Fk_wMKi5PH0/UMzdjlmTNLI/AAAAAAABk0s/mo6zG0E9tv0/s400/Lyell%2526Maclure-Aug1-04-3JoelAtLyellEastCol.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Joel Wilson reaches the east col of Mt Lyell on our acent during the Sierra Challenge.

After taking a few photos we attempted to follow the route shown on the topo, but it soon became obvious that the ridge was NOT 3rd class like it was marked in the topo. We crossed the moat along the cliffs several times as we headed west, looking for a break in the cliffs. After about 200 feet I saw a series of steep ledges that looked to be high class 3 to class 4. Joel and I scrambled up the ledges and the route seemed to go through. The rock was solid and the climbing exposed. After zigzagging up the cliff face we reached a subtle ridge and followed it to the summit of Mt Lyell.  \r\n  &lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-CsGMAVu7tYg/UMzdmfvTb5I/AAAAAAABk1E/LxUmvAaAW7s/s2000/Lyell%2526Maclure-Aug1-04-6MtMaclureFromLyellSummit.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-CsGMAVu7tYg/UMzdmfvTb5I/AAAAAAABk1E/LxUmvAaAW7s/s600/Lyell%2526Maclure-Aug1-04-6MtMaclureFromLyellSummit.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Mt Maclure seen from the summit of Mt Lyell&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n  Bob Burd had signed the summit register a full half hour before us! Our route finding difficulties had really slowed us up. Joel and I headed northwest toward the class 3-4 west ridge of Mt Lyell. We angled away from the main ridge and dropped straight to the glacier down some steep sandy ledges. The snow was very steep and hard packed, so we put on our crampons and down climbed the slope facing into the hill.  Just at this time Matthew Holliman was topping out of the glacier, looking very flustered. He had no crampons!  To save weight he had only brought an ice axe, figuring that the snow would have softened up by the time we reached the peaks.  Now he was climbing precariously up the slope, chopping foot steps for himself with his ice axe. He had chosen to climb Maclure first and was now heading up Lyell. We wished him luck on the unpleasant loose route up that part of the mountain and headed down to the saddle separating Mt Maclure and Mt Lyell.   \r\n  &lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-mna1EULDeDk/UMzdnlmPQ5I/AAAAAAABk1M/cZbmaK-DRHU/s2000/Lyell%2526Maclure-Aug1-04-7WRidgeMtLyell.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-mna1EULDeDk/UMzdnlmPQ5I/AAAAAAABk1M/cZbmaK-DRHU/s600/Lyell%2526Maclure-Aug1-04-7WRidgeMtLyell.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Looking back at the West Ridge of Mt Lyell from the West col between Mt Lyell and Mt Maclure.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n  Joel took off ahead of me at this point and soon disappeared. I trudged up the unpleasant class 2 boulders, heading towards the horizon of the hillside in front of me. Finally I reached the beginnings of some solid rock just as Joe Dawson, John Fedak, and Michelle Peot were heading down. As I waited for them to climb through the bottleneck I questioned them about the remainder of the climb. Apparently some good class 3 was all that I had left!\r\n\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;h2&gt;\r\n&lt;a name=\"TOC-Southeast-Ridge-of-Mt-Maclure\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Southeast Ridge of Mt Maclure&lt;/h2&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;&lt;table border=\"0\" width=\"200\"&gt;\r\n&lt;tbody&gt;\r\n&lt;tr&gt;\r\n&lt;td&gt;&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-_v3-aT66PpY/UMzdo26zX8I/AAAAAAABk1U/N-533W5z9Ek/s2000/Lyell%2526Maclure-Aug1-04-8ERidgeOfMaclure.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"\" src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-_v3-aT66PpY/UMzdo26zX8I/AAAAAAABk1U/N-533W5z9Ek/s400/Lyell%2526Maclure-Aug1-04-8ERidgeOfMaclure.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;East Ridge of Maclure&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\r\n&lt;td&gt;&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-u_kbPETIpjY/UMzdpycUbEI/AAAAAAABk1c/_x3c2dhgTsA/s2000/Lyell%2526Maclure-Aug1-04-9MtLyellFromMtMaclure.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"\" src=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-u_kbPETIpjY/UMzdpycUbEI/AAAAAAABk1c/_x3c2dhgTsA/s400/Lyell%2526Maclure-Aug1-04-9MtLyellFromMtMaclure.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Lyell from Maclure Summit&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\r\n&lt;/tr&gt;\r\n&lt;/tbody&gt;\r\n&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;I scrambled up onto the ridge and followed the sheer knife edge over to the windy summit.  By this point I figured that I was the last one up there and became worried of getting left without a ride at the trailhead again. I hurried back along the ridge and dropped down to the glacier. I was pleasantly surprised to find a snowfield that cut through the tedious talus slope and glissaded down the slope. Traversing across the glacier I soon caught up with Joe, John, and Michelle. &lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-GziTPr5MyP4/UMzdrRYW70I/AAAAAAABk1k/n-QE4HEy040/s2000/Lyell%2526Maclure-Aug1-04-10MtLyell.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"\" src=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-GziTPr5MyP4/UMzdrRYW70I/AAAAAAABk1k/n-QE4HEy040/s600/Lyell%2526Maclure-Aug1-04-10MtLyell.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Mt Lyell from Muir Trail&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n    At this point we were all tired out and moving slowly. Since I knew that Michelle could give me a ride I relaxed and hiked with the rest of the group at an easier pace. Soon we reached the never ending cycle of meadows and trees filling Lyell Canyon. It was mid-afternoon and now the trail was full of backpackers. Most were carrying fishing poles and nearly all of them were about 30 lbs overweight and sitting alongside the trail.  Apparently this easy stretch of the John Muir trail was popular for easy backpacking fishing trips!  \r\n    &lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n    We stopped for a short break, ate some food, and soaked our feet in the cold creek. The rest felt nice and the cold water felt nice against our bruised and battered feet. Then we were on our way again. By this time I had developed a coping mechanism to deal with the torture of Lyell Canyon. I picked out a patch of rocks on the opposite hillside as far down the canyon as I could see. I watched with excitement as these rocks slowly got closer to us. By the time we were even with them I rewarded myself by picking out another marker as far down the canyon as I could see.  This psychotic exercise and our group&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;s incessant fantasizing of that night&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;s dinner kept me going.  \r\n    &lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n    As we neared a bend that I excitedly pointed out as the end of that godforsaken Lyell Canyon John began to fall behind. He assured us he would catch up and we continued on.  Once we reached the meadow we got confused as to which trail to take &amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#147; there were a lot of forks in the trail that we had missed hiking in the dark earlier that day.  Joe directed us on right fork after a bridge crossing and we soon reached an inconclusive break in the trial at another river. We waited here a while for John to catch up and eventually gave up waiting for him.  I took my best guess as to which way to go and we hiked on. We crossed a bridge and passed the Tuolomne Meadows lodge. Now we knew were we were going &amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#147; we had ended up somewhere east of the trailhead. Joe and Michelle recognized were we were and we headed down the road to reach the trailhead parking.  \r\n    &lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n    I was exhausted. We had been hiking for about 14 hours at a very fast pace and my legs were beat. I knew that I probably wouldn&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;t have the strength in me to cover the 18 miles and 6,240 ft vertical gain to climb Mt Julius Ceasar the following day. I had pushed myself to my limit.  \r\n&lt;h2&gt;\r\n&lt;a name=\"TOC-Day-3:-Homeless-in-Bishop\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Day 3: Homeless in Bishop&lt;/h2&gt;\r\n&lt;h3&gt;\r\n&lt;a name=\"TOC-August-2nd-2004\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;August 2nd, 2004&lt;/h3&gt;\r\n\r\n\r\nA lot had happened the previous day. I had hiked way too fast and my legs were a wreck. I also experienced some very bad chafing to the point of bleeding and as a result I could hardly move my legs. I stayed in a motel in Bishop with Dave Wright that night, but because of our differences in schedules on the Challenge, he suggested that I ride and stay with Bob Burd for the rest of the trip.   \r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\nDave headed out to climb Julius Ceasar with the rest of the group while I stayed in Bishop to recuperate. The motel room was only booked for one night, so at 11 am I gathered all of my gear together and checked out. At this point I had nowhere to go and had all day to spend in Bishop.  I headed to the park to lay in the shade and read a book.  I looked rather odd walking around town, as I was carrying one large backpacking pack stuffed as full as I could get it, a full daypack, and a rolling suite case. I was also looked disheveled and walked with an awkward limp.  \r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\nI laid against a tree in the park and read my book. I noticed some other people waiting around in the park who waved to me. They were homeless people! They must have thought that I was one of them!  \r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\nSpending all day in the park with nothing to do nearly drove me crazy. I finished my book and tossed &amp;amp; turned beneath the shady trees until it was time to head over to where we had agreed to have dinner.

Bob, Michael, and I headed out to the Basin Mountain trailhead while Matthew went on his own hike for the day. Today, as in the first day, there would be two groups on the mountain: Michael, Bob, Michelle, Joe, and I would climb the class 4 east chute of Basin Mountain. The rest of the group were going to ascend the class 2 northwest slopes of the peak. &lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n    While technically easier, this latter route seemed nuts to me &amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#147; who in their right mind would want to slog up a 2,000 ft scree slope in the midday sun??!!  Our route would take us up 5,000 vertical feet in a little under 5 miles. For those who still had the energy, Bob had planned to scramble along the class 4 ridgeline and climb and unnamed peak before ascending the 4 Gables and descending the East Chutes of the Gables.  \r\n  &lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;&lt;table border=\"0\" width=\"200\"&gt;\r\n&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;\r\n&lt;td&gt;&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-IwEhdKjTI54/UMzeIumalfI/AAAAAAABk4A/dsDLrq998Qs/s2000/BasinMtn-Aug3-04-1SunriseAtTH.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-IwEhdKjTI54/UMzeIumalfI/AAAAAAABk4A/dsDLrq998Qs/s400/BasinMtn-Aug3-04-1SunriseAtTH.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Sunrise at Horton Lakes TH&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\r\n&lt;td&gt;&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-bScaRdP7ddM/UMzeJ8ClC3I/AAAAAAABk4I/fsVRidO9rjg/s2000/BasinMtn-Aug3-04-2SunriseAtTH.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-bScaRdP7ddM/UMzeJ8ClC3I/AAAAAAABk4I/fsVRidO9rjg/s400/BasinMtn-Aug3-04-2SunriseAtTH.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Sunrise at Horton Lakes TH&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\r\n&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;\r\n&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\nThe dirt road taken to get to the trailhead had been described as &amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#156;rough&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#157; &amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#147; this was very true and four wheel drive was a nice asset to have. We all met at the gate blocking further access on the road and were hiking by 6am.  \r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\nI took off first and easily stayed in the lead. I had had a full rest day, and that certainly gave me an advantage, but I think the real reason I hiked so much faster was because we were heading straight up a steep continuous slope rather than a meandering trail, and physically hiking up the slope was more like hiking in the Wasatch than in the Sierra. I headed straight up the hillside through the sagebrush, cutting across the road switchbacks. I kept a mild rest step going but never stopped, and within an hour I was at the top of the steep slope and was following an old mining road as it traversed around the slope and headed into a hanging valley.  Everyone else was far behind.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;&lt;table border=\"0\" width=\"200\"&gt;\r\n&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;\r\n&lt;td&gt;&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-GmzUS58e-OE/UMzeLLseYmI/AAAAAAABk4Q/GaMVR5lIevE/s2000/BasinMtn-Aug3-04-3BasinCirque.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"\" border=\"2\" src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-GmzUS58e-OE/UMzeLLseYmI/AAAAAAABk4Q/GaMVR5lIevE/s240/BasinMtn-Aug3-04-3BasinCirque.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Looking north in the cirque below Basin Mountain while ascending the East Couloir Route.

It was unexpectedly more beautiful than I had expected. I was treated with a nice view of rugged High Sierra peaks to the south, a bare dusty valley in striking contrast to the east, a steep snow-covered slope to the west, and huge cliffs towering above me from the north to the south west.  Soon the road ended and I scrambled up the loose rock moraines in the cirque. After some ups and downs I came to a tongue of snow. The snow was rock hard, but I could edge my shoes just enough as I kicked to make some faint steps, so I raced up the snow to avoid walking on the talus.  Ahead of me was a very steep chute filled with talus and scree, rising for another 1,000 vertical feet before terminating at a prominent notch in the cliffs. Because I had hiked over a moraine at the mouth of the valley, I knew that this chute wouldn&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;t be easy &amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#147; it would likely be filled with lots of large rocks supported by a base of scree with a consistency of powdered sugar.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;&lt;table border=\"0\" width=\"200\"&gt;\r\n&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;\r\n&lt;td&gt;&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-yOyxrSu0MOQ/UMzeOsLhE9I/AAAAAAABk4o/hYbudSYCCdo/s2000/BasinMtn-Aug3-04-6BasinCirqueMoraine.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"\" border=\"2\" src=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-yOyxrSu0MOQ/UMzeOsLhE9I/AAAAAAABk4o/hYbudSYCCdo/s400/BasinMtn-Aug3-04-6BasinCirqueMoraine.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Looking up the horrible class 2 slip \'n slide chute below the East Couloir from the cirque below Basin Mountain while ascending the East Couloir Route.

Rocks slide down as I stepped up, and by the time my leg was extended I was lower than I had been before standing up! I had to scramble up the slope on all fours to maintain progress, and the constant sluffing of debris was very tiring. I headed toward the seemingly more solid south side of the chute and took a brief food break on a large stone stuck in the hillside.  By then the others had reached the snow tongue, so I slung on my pack and continued up the slope.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;&lt;table border=\"0\" width=\"200\"&gt;\r\n&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;\r\n&lt;td&gt;&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-6H-vrik6Mn4/UMzeQ_XbuRI/AAAAAAABk44/FylheZkbsYY/s2000/BasinMtn-Aug3-04-8MtHumphreys.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-6H-vrik6Mn4/UMzeQ_XbuRI/AAAAAAABk44/FylheZkbsYY/s400/BasinMtn-Aug3-04-8MtHumphreys.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Mt Humphreys seen from the notch along the East Couloir Route.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\r\n&lt;td&gt;&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-W2Z3sYer7xw/UMzeRwc0cTI/AAAAAAABk5A/Ebinj54He8w/s2000/BasinMtn-Aug3-04-9MtHumphreys.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-W2Z3sYer7xw/UMzeRwc0cTI/AAAAAAABk5A/Ebinj54He8w/s400/BasinMtn-Aug3-04-9MtHumphreys.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Mt Humphreys seen from the notch along the East Couloir Route.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\r\n&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;\r\n&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-VI6bR8rLsKU/UMzeT1G-jHI/AAAAAAABk5Q/jspRvNtRasI/s2000/BasinMtn-Aug3-04-11MtHumphreys.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"\" border=\"2\" src=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-VI6bR8rLsKU/UMzeT1G-jHI/AAAAAAABk5Q/jspRvNtRasI/s600/BasinMtn-Aug3-04-11MtHumphreys.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Mt Humphreys seen from the notch along the East Couloir Route.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n  Soon I was near the notch, but the notch was split!! I had no idea which way to go, so I waited up for Bob to tell me.  Once he was within earshot I asked for directions.  \r\n  &lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n  &amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#156;Which way do we go, left or right?&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#157; I shouted. Bob shrugged his shoulders. Crap &amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#147; I let Bob and Michael catch up to me and they were of no help &amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#147; so much for my lead.  I picked the right chute and slogged on. At the top of the chute I spotted a nice ledge system heading back to the east. I climbed up a chimney and traversed along the ledge. Michael followed me this way while Bob took another route.&amp;Acirc;&amp;nbsp;&lt;div&gt;&amp;Acirc;&amp;nbsp;  &lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-ARR-3tE9R7Q/UMzeUwI44bI/AAAAAAABk5c/0XkDb1wCSaQ/s2000/BasinMtn-Aug3-04-12MtSill.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img border=\"2\" src=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-ARR-3tE9R7Q/UMzeUwI44bI/AAAAAAABk5c/0XkDb1wCSaQ/s600/BasinMtn-Aug3-04-12MtSill.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Mt Sill and the Palisades seen from the class 4 wall off the East Couloir.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n  I stopped to climb up a nice looking off-width chimney at a point where the ledge narrowed and Michael continued around the corner on the ledge. About 10 ft up the chimney was a large chock stone, and above that were some large holds. I wanted to take this more direct route rather than wasting time traversing back and forth on the cliff, so I climbed up the chimney. I knocked on the chock stone and it felt very solid &amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#147; there was no hollow drumming sound or vibration, and it seemed secure. I stood up on the chock stone and began searching for some good holds to use for exiting the chimney. 10 feet below me was a 4 ft wide ledge and then a 50 foot drop to the saddle below, so I wanted to make sure my next move was very secure. Suddenly the chock stone blew out from underneath and I fell. I was startled but luckily I had enough sense to lean into the rock to avoid toppling over backward and out from the chimney. My head raked along the gap of the chimney, my helmet grinding against the rock. Then I hit the ledge with my legs slightly bent. They splayed out behind me and I ended up lying belly first against the inside corner of the ledge and the granite wall. Luckily I didn&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;t bounce off the ledge.  \r\n  &lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-03LELnxcoQo/UMzeZQQEnOI/AAAAAAABk58/tEQDVTwu4ug/s2000/BasinMtn-Aug3-04-15Ouch.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img border=\"2\" src=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-03LELnxcoQo/UMzeZQQEnOI/AAAAAAABk58/tEQDVTwu4ug/s600/BasinMtn-Aug3-04-15Ouch.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;While climbing the East Couloir I had a chock stone blow out from under me, and I fell about 10 feet onto a ledge. Luckily I only escaped with this \'scratch\', and I went on to summit Basin Mountain, South Basin Mountain and the Four Gables that day.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n  During the fall my right shin had raked against the rough granite and now it was bleeding profusely. There was a large mass of red and black covering about 3 square inches of my shin just below the kneecap, and the blood poured down the shin and all over my climbing shoe. I was still a little bit in shock from the traumatic fall and felt no pain, so I continued on. I was still very unnerved from the fall, though, and moved very conservatively. For the rest of the Challenge I was very leery of climbing on any rock that looked as if it could break off.&amp;Acirc;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;\r\n&lt;div&gt;&amp;Acirc;&amp;nbsp;  &lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-vbGG2AVlXrA/UMzeWKSHmhI/AAAAAAABk5k/X6xL550u0XY/s2000/BasinMtn-Aug3-04-13MtTom.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img border=\"2\" src=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-vbGG2AVlXrA/UMzeWKSHmhI/AAAAAAABk5k/X6xL550u0XY/s600/BasinMtn-Aug3-04-13MtTom.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Mt Tom seen from the summit of Basin Mountain.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n  I was tense and fatigued from the boost of adrenaline as I reached the summit. Bob and Michael were waiting for me there and they were surprised to see the state I was in. My leg was still bleeding a bit, but for the most part the blood had coagulated. I took off my climbing shoe to check the extent of the injury &amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#147; blood had poured all over the tongue of the shoe and had collected inside of it. Michael got out his first-aide kit and gave me some anti-septic sticks to treat the gouged wounds. The problem was my leg had so much red and black gobs on it that I couldn&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;t tell where I had been cut. Not wanting to start the bleeding again I doused the area that seemed to be were I had been gouged and slapped on a band aide.  It looked rather silly &amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#147; a small band aid stuck on the middle of a bloody leg. It looked quite insufficient, but it was the largest band aid we had.   &lt;i&gt;(Later on the wound would get infected and I would need medical treatment. On the bright side, I got to take part in a study for its treatment and was paid in the process.)&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;h2&gt;\r\n&lt;a name=\"TOC-Traversing-to-South-Basin-Peak\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Traversing to South Basin Peak&lt;/h2&gt;\r\nI was not ready to give up for the day, though. The wound had stopped bleeding and didn&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;t hurt, so I followed Bob and Michael along the class 4 ridgeline instead of descending. It was too early in the day to head down! The ridge was solid for the most part and had some very exposed portions. At one point Bob jumped across a gap. Michael did the same. I had had enough falls for the day, so I cowardly crawled into the gap, reached across it, and climbed up the other side.  After a while I began to realize that Bob wasn&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;t always taking the line of least resistance on the ridge &amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#147; best not to follow him blindly.  \r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-l8J16IHaJSA/UMzeX4X3iaI/AAAAAAABk50/U2wTgAPgVcs/s2000/BasinMtn-Aug3-04-14WRidge%2526SBasinMtnLabels.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img border=\"2\" src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-l8J16IHaJSA/UMzeX4X3iaI/AAAAAAABk50/U2wTgAPgVcs/s600/BasinMtn-Aug3-04-14WRidge%2526SBasinMtnLabels.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;South Basin Mountain and the East Ridge seen from the summit of Basin Mountain.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\nAt a particularly exposed part of the ridge Michael and I saw Bob climb straight up a nasty looking part of the ridge. We had had enough of this and chose our own line on the ridge. We climbed some parallel finger cracks ascending diagonally up the left side of the ridge, foot jamming the lower crack and holding onto the upper crack for balance. We topped out behind Bob &amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#147; apparently he had wanted to get an awesome shot of us climbing up the way he had gone, but we didn&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;t follow him as expected.&amp;Acirc;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;\r\n&lt;div&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-dWsmCxjo8iY/UMzeaYDZSBI/AAAAAAABk6E/Ut45yXSWKro/s2000/BasinMtn-Aug3-04-16SBasinMtn.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img border=\"2\" src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-dWsmCxjo8iY/UMzeaYDZSBI/AAAAAAABk6E/Ut45yXSWKro/s600/BasinMtn-Aug3-04-16SBasinMtn.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;South Basin Mountain seen from the class 4 East Ridge.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\nSoon we came to the crux of the ridge &amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#147; a rather awkward off width chimney with a chock stone at the top. Michael had a harder time climbing down it than Bob since he was shorter. I followed, hanging with fully extended arms onto the top of the chimney and reaching as low down as I could to find a foothold. Then we were on our way and soon topped out on the summit of the unnamed peak along the ridge.  \r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\nSurprisingly it had a summit register, an old band aide can left by a Sierra Club ascent party in 1960. There were very few signatures and the register, one of note being Peter Croft\'s signature. Apparently the peak was informally named South Basin Mountain (being slightly further south of the summit of Basin Mountain). We happily added our names to the register and continued on.  \r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;h2&gt;\r\n&lt;a name=\"TOC-Traversing-to-Four-Gables\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Traversing to Four Gables&lt;/h2&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-7pVL5GVeGPE/UMzebu30FQI/AAAAAAABk6M/MopSzsQv0IM/s2000/BasinMtn-Aug3-04-17SnowMeltwaterAtPlateau.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img border=\"2\" src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-7pVL5GVeGPE/UMzebu30FQI/AAAAAAABk6M/MopSzsQv0IM/s600/BasinMtn-Aug3-04-17SnowMeltwaterAtPlateau.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;The plateau west of South Basin Mountain. One tops out here when approaching from Upper Horton Lakes.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n  \r\n  By this time all that class 4 climbing had tired me out psychologically, since I was still reeling from my fall earlier in the day. Making sure to keep good footing while boulder hopping down the south slopes of South Basin Mountain, I soon fell behind Bob and Michael, who weren&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;t walking nearly as conservatively as I was.  Once I noticed this I rushed to catch up. I met up with them as they were filling water at an unexpected stream trickling out of the remaining snow pack. Bob and Michael were concerned that I was tiring out for the day and suggested that I call it a day and descend the class 2 gully that the stream drained down.  I knew that my slowness was more from a psychological fatigue rather than a physical one, and since the rest of the ridge was a broad slope, I knew that I could keep up for the remainder of the climb. I insisted that I could keep up and that my falling behind was accidental. &lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n  Bob and Michael were nice enough to let me continue on with them and we soon were making good time along the sandy class 1-2 slopes of the Four Gables. It was tedious and the Four Gables didn&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;t look very impressive from our vantage point. We circled around to the west and ascended the main summit &amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#147; oddly it was obviously shorter that the next one to the south. We signed the summit register, took some photos, and headed down the class 3 east chutes.&amp;Acirc;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;\r\n&lt;div&gt;&amp;Acirc;&amp;nbsp; \r\n  &lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;&lt;table border=\"0\" width=\"200\"&gt;\r\n&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;\r\n&lt;td&gt;&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-c-3JzQ8JZAY/UMzecgJwrRI/AAAAAAABk6U/e-JHG6TmJHg/s2000/BasinMtn-Aug3-04-18LookingNW.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-c-3JzQ8JZAY/UMzecgJwrRI/AAAAAAABk6U/e-JHG6TmJHg/s240/BasinMtn-Aug3-04-18LookingNW.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Looking NW from Four Gables Summit&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\r\n&lt;td&gt;&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-eNMkC9Bxngs/UMzeeZ8J21I/AAAAAAABk6k/-S1_cth7XCI/s2000/BasinMtn-Aug3-04-20LookingW.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-eNMkC9Bxngs/UMzeeZ8J21I/AAAAAAABk6k/-S1_cth7XCI/s240/BasinMtn-Aug3-04-20LookingW.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Looking W from Four Gables Summit&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\r\n&lt;td&gt;&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-KQPaam-Ak68/UMzedkRsIlI/AAAAAAABk6c/ZYRpyQZ2M2k/s2000/BasinMtn-Aug3-04-19BearCreekSpire.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"\" border=\"2\" src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-KQPaam-Ak68/UMzedkRsIlI/AAAAAAABk6c/ZYRpyQZ2M2k/s240/BasinMtn-Aug3-04-19BearCreekSpire.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Bear Creek Spire seen from the summit of Four Gables&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\r\n&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;\r\n&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;&lt;table border=\"0\" width=\"200\"&gt;\r\n&lt;tbody&gt;\r\n&lt;tr&gt;\r\n&lt;td&gt;&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-cYrO3_EfrNg/UMzegXBux_I/AAAAAAABk60/vhiaX2Qw9gQ/s2000/BasinMtn-Aug3-04-22SBasinMtn.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"\" border=\"2\" src=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-cYrO3_EfrNg/UMzegXBux_I/AAAAAAABk60/vhiaX2Qw9gQ/s400/BasinMtn-Aug3-04-22SBasinMtn.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;South Basin Mountain seen from the summit of Four Gables (from the north)&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\r\n&lt;td&gt;&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-oc8pGiZAbl4/UMzefXZkwZI/AAAAAAABk6s/4yRT-M_vecM/s2000/BasinMtn-Aug3-04-21MtHumphreysFrom4Gables.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"\" border=\"2\" src=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-oc8pGiZAbl4/UMzefXZkwZI/AAAAAAABk6s/4yRT-M_vecM/s400/BasinMtn-Aug3-04-21MtHumphreysFrom4Gables.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Mt Humphreys seen from the summit of Four Gables&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\r\n&lt;/tr&gt;\r\n&lt;tr&gt;\r\n&lt;td&gt;&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-R9k-d6dA8qg/UMzehLaIbKI/AAAAAAABk68/bJSG9cRYbkk/s2000/BasinMtn-Aug3-04-23BasinMtnFrom4Gables.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-R9k-d6dA8qg/UMzehLaIbKI/AAAAAAABk68/bJSG9cRYbkk/s400/BasinMtn-Aug3-04-23BasinMtnFrom4Gables.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Basin Mtn from Four Gables&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\r\n&lt;td&gt;&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-huaaMcUlDjo/UMzeifixipI/AAAAAAABk7E/whEQtd6-EOo/s2000/BasinMtn-Aug3-04-24MtTom.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-huaaMcUlDjo/UMzeifixipI/AAAAAAABk7E/whEQtd6-EOo/s400/BasinMtn-Aug3-04-24MtTom.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Mt Tom from Four Gables&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\r\n&lt;/tr&gt;\r\n&lt;/tbody&gt;\r\n&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n  The chutes had some moderately loose rock and we took care to climb one at a time or stay out of each other&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;s fall line. After descending about 400 feet we crossed over the ar&amp;Atilde;&amp;ordf;te to our left and continued descending the next chute over. It was nice for a descent, but the route certainly didn&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;t seem like a fun one to climb up.  \r\n  &lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\nBob soon disappeared in the lead and Michael and I hiked down together. In hopes of catching up to him, we took a shortcut across the open grassy slopes and rock slabs of a plateau to the west of the Upper Horton Lakes. We descended the next drainage over and were just about down to the trail when we spotted Bob about even with us. He was already on the trail and we had some bushwacking to do, so we lost him again.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;&lt;table border=\"0\" width=\"200\"&gt;\r\n&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;\r\n&lt;td&gt;&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-g6pKfZnuKFY/UMzejS1tqHI/AAAAAAABk7Q/4ToCjPnhAKc/s2000/BasinMtn-Aug3-04-254GablesFromBelwUpperHortonLake.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"\" border=\"2\" src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-g6pKfZnuKFY/UMzejS1tqHI/AAAAAAABk7Q/4ToCjPnhAKc/s400/BasinMtn-Aug3-04-254GablesFromBelwUpperHortonLake.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Looking up Horton Creek Canyon.

Every branch seemed to smack against my bloodied shin. Luckily we were soon out of the brush and on the trail.  Soon we caught up to Bob and we hiked together down Horton Canyon.  Along the descent we had nice views of the south slopes of Mt Tom. We also came across some remnants of an old mining camp.  \r\n  &lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n  Having climbed 2 more peaks than everyone else, we had expected to be the last ones at the trailhead. Instead we were the first ones back! Apparently everyone had had some sort of trouble on the mountain that day.  Joe and Michelle had fallen behind us early on and had taken the wrong chute in the hanging valley. They ended up a good ways east along the ridge and had a long tedious scramble along it to get to the summit.    \r\n  &lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n  Michelle and Joe descended behind the others who had come up the north side.  As they descended, one of those hikers, Peter Sih, had somehow gotten himself stuck in the middle of some exposed cliffs and couldn&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;t climb out. Michelle down climbed to help him while Joe ran out to call Mountain Search and Rescue. Joe had a run in with a mountain lion on the way down but got back to the trailhead without incident.  Michelle was able to get Peter off of the cliffs and everyone was back at the trailhead by the time Mountain Search and Rescue arrived, saving them from needing to do a rescue.  \r\n  &lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n  Everyone seemed to have had some bad luck that day &amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#147; hopefully things would be better in the days to come.\r\n  &lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;hr&gt;\r\n&lt;hr&gt;\r\n&lt;h2&gt;\r\n&lt;a name=\"TOC-Links\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Links&lt;/h2&gt;\r\n&lt;ul&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://picasaweb.google.com/105894936663116565516/20040803SierraChallengeBasinMtnSBasinMtn4Gables?authuser=0&amp;amp;feat=directlink\"&gt;Picasa Photos&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://www.snwburd.com/bob/trip_reports/basin_s_1.html\"&gt;Bob Burd\'s Sierra Challenge TR &amp;amp; Photos&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://www.summitpost.org/my-first-sierra-challenge-2004/169860\"&gt;SummitPost TR&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;/ul&gt;\r\n&lt;hr&gt;\r\n&lt;hr&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"http://www.markpthomas.com/mountaineering/trip-reports/california/my-first-sierra-challenge-2004\"&gt;2004 Sierra Challenge&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"http://www.markpthomas.com/mountaineering/trip-reports/california/nw-ridge-of-n-pk-and-n-ridge-of-mt-conness\"&gt;Day 1: North Peak &amp;amp; Mt Conness&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"http://www.markpthomas.com/mountaineering/trip-reports/california/mt-lyell-mt-maclure\"&gt;Day 2: Mt Lyell &amp;amp; Mt Maclure&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n-&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"http://www.markpthomas.com/mountaineering/trip-reports/california/mt-haeckel-mt-wallace\"&gt;Day 5: Mt Haeckel &amp;amp; Mt Wallace&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"http://www.markpthomas.com/mountaineering/trip-reports/california/mt-winchell-e-arete\"&gt;Day 6: Mt Winchell&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"http://www.markpthomas.com/mountaineering/trip-reports/california/mt-jepson-palisade-crest\"&gt;Day 7: Palisade Crest &amp;amp; Mt Jepson&lt;/a&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;/div&gt;\r\n&lt;/div&gt; \r\n'),(85,71,'/mountaineering/trip-reports/california/mt-haeckel-mt-wallace','Day 5: Mt Haeckel &amp; Mt Wallace','2004 Sierra Challenge - Day 5: Mt Haeckel &amp; Mt Wallace','Trip_Report','content: &lt;div dir=\"ltr\"&gt;\r\n&lt;h1&gt;\r\n&lt;a name=\"TOC-2004-Sierra-Challenge---Day-5:-Mt-Haeckel-Mt-Wallace\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;2004 Sierra Challenge - Day 5: Mt Haeckel &amp;amp; Mt Wallace&lt;/h1&gt;\r\n&lt;h2&gt;\r\n&lt;a name=\"TOC-August-4th-2004\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;August 4th, 2004&lt;/h2&gt;\r\n&lt;hr&gt;\r\n&lt;hr&gt;\r\n&lt;table&gt;\r\n&lt;tbody&gt;\r\n&lt;tr&gt;\r\n&lt;td width=\"40%\"&gt;\r\n&lt;font color=\"BLUE\"&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;b&gt;Stats&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/font&gt;\r\n&lt;ul&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;Routes:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href=\"http://www.summitpost.org/show/route_link.pl/route_id/4185/object_id/1347\"&gt;East Ridge&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"http://www.summitpost.org/show/route_link.pl/route_id/4295/object_id/3981\"&gt;South Ridge&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"http://www.summitpost.org/show/route_link.pl/route_id/4839/object_id/3981\"&gt;Southeast Slopes&lt;/a&gt;\r\n&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;Elevation Gained:&lt;/b&gt; 4,200\'  \r\n&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;RT Distance:&lt;/b&gt; 16 mi  \r\n&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;RT Time:&lt;/b&gt; 10hr&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;Trailhead:&lt;/b&gt; Lake Sabrina  \r\n&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;Summit Elevs.:&lt;/b&gt; Mt.

Today Bob Burd, Michael Graup, and Matthew Holliman were going to climb Mt Haeckel via the class 3 East Ridge and then follow the class 3 South Ridge over to the summit of Mt Wallace. Haeckel was supposed to have some interesting class 3 scrambles while Wallace, considered a good peak to do in combination, was described as a talus pile. Dave Wright showed up at the trailhead with plans only to have a nice hike, but none for really summitting anything. Joe Dawson was also going to join us. At 6:10 everyone left the trailhead except Joe, who had failed to show up. &lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n  We hiked along the edge of Lake (Reservoir) Sabrina as the trail gradually ascended the southern slopes. The hiking was easy, and today I seemed to be having an easier time keeping up with Bob and the gang &amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#147; I was finally getting used to the pace of the hiking. The beautiful trail switch backed up some slopes and cut across the east end of Blue Lake.

The imposing &amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#156;Picture Peak&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#157; towered majestically above the lake and again everyone was taking photos. Bob announced that he was going to stop by the lake shore to refill his water and that he would catch up, so Matthew, Michael, and I cut off the trail and headed up the steep cliffy slopes of a ridge spur to the west. We easily picked our way through the cliffs. Thinking that we were getting ahead of Bob, I was surprised to find that he had had enough time to refill he water and intercept us at a saddle in the ridge. We then followed him as the terrain turned to some class 3 scrambling. Bob led us along the south side of the ridge and we soon began climbing some terrain that was definitely more difficulty. One exposed traverse was particularly tricky, requiring some awkward bending postures and scarce handholds, but soon we were past the ridge and crossing the outlet of another picturesque alpine lake.\r\n  &lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n  Bob led the way, heading up the steeper but more solid looking east side of a buttress on the south side of the lake. As the terrain became more questionable Bob explained his intent to us &amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#147; the actual route passed on the other side of the cliffs, but he wanted to see if he could find his way up these cliffs and over an unnamed high point before continuing on to the East Ridge of Haeckel. He had no idea how difficult this improvised route might be, and we all opted to take the easier and more certain option of traversing back around the cliffs rather than following Bob.\r\n  &lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;h2&gt;\r\n&lt;a name=\"TOC-East-Ridge-of-Mt-Haeckel\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;East Ridge of Mt Haeckel&lt;/h2&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;We climbed up and to the north and soon were over the cliffs and above the loose talus slopes leading down to the alpine lake we had passed. From there it was a somewhat tedious boulder-hop to a point where we could traverse to a snowfield leading to the East Ridge of Mt Haeckel. Haeckel was beautiful, rising like a white citadel high above the snowfield before us. Michael and I were out in front cramponing up the steep snowfield and Matthew followed about 5 minutes behind. The final chute of the snowfield was about 35-35&lt;sup&gt;o&lt;/sup&gt; and composed of very hard packed and sun cupped snow, providing some good practice for our French Technique.&amp;Acirc;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;&lt;table&gt;\r\n&lt;tbody&gt;\r\n&lt;tr&gt;\r\n&lt;td&gt;&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-NjoV-TOSj2A/UMzexYrm2ZI/AAAAAAABk9g/nMGNV91-UZk/s2000/HaekelWallace-Aug4-04-14BobsUnkownPt.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-NjoV-TOSj2A/UMzexYrm2ZI/AAAAAAABk9g/nMGNV91-UZk/s400/HaekelWallace-Aug4-04-14BobsUnkownPt.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;The north ridge of Peak 13,080\' seen from the approach to the East Ridge of Haekel.

We obviously couldn&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;t head straight up from the saddle &amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#147; that was definitely harder than class 3. Michael seemed to know where he was going and charged out in front. I followed close behind and Matthew fell further behind. We traversed onto the south slope of the peak. The terrain was very steeped and composed of granite terraces, rising like steps toward the summit. I kept looking for a way to get onto the East Ridge but could find no such class 3 route. Meanwhile, Michael kept heading west until he was nearly at the South Ridge of the peak before cutting up! I thought that this route was very strange since we were nowhere near the East Ridge. In fact, I was rather disappointed, since the granite terraces only offered intermittent class 3 scrambling on a line not nearly as aesthetic as the rugged skyline of the East Ridge.&amp;Acirc;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-k5MjR-Ky9vM/UMze5VzgBmI/AAAAAAABk-I/vjwSEM66gGM/s2000/HaekelWallace-Aug4-04-19EastRidgeOfHaekel.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-k5MjR-Ky9vM/UMze5VzgBmI/AAAAAAABk-I/vjwSEM66gGM/s800/HaekelWallace-Aug4-04-19EastRidgeOfHaekel.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;The East Ridge of Mt Haeckel.

The summit block was exposed and required some mantling. Michael and I barely stayed on top long enough to sign the summit register &amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#147; the wind was howling and it was very cold on top.\r\n  &lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;h2&gt;\r\n&lt;a name=\"TOC-Traverse-to-Mt-Wallace\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Traverse to Mt Wallace&lt;/h2&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;&lt;table&gt;\r\n&lt;tbody&gt;\r\n&lt;tr&gt;\r\n&lt;td&gt;&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-RucxO8xV4_0/UMze6ThwNKI/AAAAAAABk-Q/E-ON-WeBsZo/s2000/HaekelWallace-Aug4-04-20SRidgeOfHaekel.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-RucxO8xV4_0/UMze6ThwNKI/AAAAAAABk-Q/E-ON-WeBsZo/s400/HaekelWallace-Aug4-04-20SRidgeOfHaekel.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;The South Ridge traverse between Mt Wallace and Mt Haeckel, seen from Haeckel\'s East Ridge Route.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\r\n&lt;td&gt;&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-8ld2CSJQ2Go/UMze71Q6WnI/AAAAAAABk-Y/KOMBwyPytqw/s2000/HaekelWallace-Aug4-04-21WallaceFromEastRidge.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-8ld2CSJQ2Go/UMze71Q6WnI/AAAAAAABk-Y/KOMBwyPytqw/s400/HaekelWallace-Aug4-04-21WallaceFromEastRidge.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;The talus pile that is Mt Wallace, seen from the East Ridge of Mt Haeckel.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\r\n&lt;/tr&gt;\r\n&lt;/tbody&gt;\r\n&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n  \r\n  As we headed down we heard someone coming up through the first notch in the summit ridge. &amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#152;It&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;s probably Matthew,&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153; we surmised to each other. Suddenly Bob appeared. Apparently Bob had passed him a ways down and Matthew was moving about 10 minutes behind. The summit was cold enough that we all decided not to wait for him. He could catch up to us on the South Ridge.\r\n  &lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n  Once again I was somewhat disappointed with the route. It was called the South Ridge, but it traveled some 100 ft below the actual ridge! I would have like to stay right on the ridge, but it seemed rather silly to do so when traversing along the east slopes slightly lower down was so much easier, and I didn&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;t want to make myself any slower than I needed to since I had two fast scramblers to keep up with.\r\n  &lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n  As usual, Bob and Michael pulled ahead and I was left to my own enjoyment of the ridge. Once I got to Mt Wallace I was pleasantly surprised. Although the chutes one could ascend were talus piles, it was not only more fun but also easier to ascend some class three walls and chimneys along the sides of the chutes to reach the summit.\r\n  &lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;&lt;table&gt;\r\n&lt;tbody&gt;\r\n&lt;tr&gt;\r\n&lt;td&gt;&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-napRLJehbLw/UMze9gGf3sI/AAAAAAABk-g/gV3PeFDZeks/s2000/HaekelWallace-Aug4-04-22MtGoddardFromWallace.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-napRLJehbLw/UMze9gGf3sI/AAAAAAABk-g/gV3PeFDZeks/s400/HaekelWallace-Aug4-04-22MtGoddardFromWallace.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Mt Goddard seen from the summit of Mt Wallace&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\r\n&lt;td&gt;&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-bg3FfyAzVtQ/UMze_rnXJiI/AAAAAAABk-w/UPHXD-dYalg/s2000/HaekelWallace-Aug4-04-24PalisadesFromWallace.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-bg3FfyAzVtQ/UMze_rnXJiI/AAAAAAABk-w/UPHXD-dYalg/s400/HaekelWallace-Aug4-04-24PalisadesFromWallace.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Palisades seen from the summit of Mt Wallace&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\r\n&lt;/tr&gt;\r\n&lt;/tbody&gt;\r\n&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\nThe summit block was composed of two tall granite blocks, seemingly cleaved apart by some powerful force.

They were climbers visiting from Alaska.&amp;Acirc;&amp;nbsp;&amp;Acirc;&amp;nbsp;&amp;Acirc;&amp;nbsp;&amp;Acirc;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;&lt;table&gt;\r\n&lt;tbody&gt;\r\n&lt;tr&gt;\r\n&lt;td&gt;&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-8Gs3-n5tFo4/UMzfHb8ubtI/AAAAAAABk_o/8nL3ttXn6gA/s2000/HaekelWallace-Aug4-04-31BobOnOtherWallaceSummit.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-8Gs3-n5tFo4/UMzfHb8ubtI/AAAAAAABk_o/8nL3ttXn6gA/s200/HaekelWallace-Aug4-04-31BobOnOtherWallaceSummit.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Bob Burd hanging out on the shorter summit block on Mt Wallace&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\r\n&lt;td&gt;&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-kIv5zghxh-w/UMzfBxO9DTI/AAAAAAABk_A/ZlZLCIWgtMk/s2000/HaekelWallace-Aug4-04-26Michael%2526BobOnWallace.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"\" src=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-kIv5zghxh-w/UMzfBxO9DTI/AAAAAAABk_A/ZlZLCIWgtMk/s200/HaekelWallace-Aug4-04-26Michael%2526BobOnWallace.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Michael &amp;amp; Bob on Wallace&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\r\n&lt;td&gt;&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-pbcgOisv5QA/UMzfEGANb-I/AAAAAAABk_Q/iLZhhk7TouI/s2000/HaekelWallace-Aug4-04-28BobOnWallace.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"\" src=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-pbcgOisv5QA/UMzfEGANb-I/AAAAAAABk_Q/iLZhhk7TouI/s200/HaekelWallace-Aug4-04-28BobOnWallace.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Bob climbing up Wallace summit&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\r\n&lt;td&gt;&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-Gtfgw3-y3K4/UMzfE-PUu8I/AAAAAAABk_Y/7yiZ2-g4yHQ/s2000/HaekelWallace-Aug4-04-29BobMe%2526MichaelOnWallace.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"\" src=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-Gtfgw3-y3K4/UMzfE-PUu8I/AAAAAAABk_Y/7yiZ2-g4yHQ/s200/HaekelWallace-Aug4-04-29BobMe%2526MichaelOnWallace.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Bob, me, and Michael on Wallace summit&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\r\n&lt;/tr&gt;\r\n&lt;/tbody&gt;\r\n&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;&lt;table&gt;\r\n&lt;tbody&gt;\r\n&lt;tr&gt;\r\n&lt;td&gt;&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-tb9cOaJBuVo/UMze-YZbwaI/AAAAAAABk-o/N-RA7I8ieLA/s2000/HaekelWallace-Aug4-04-23UnkownPkFromWallace.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"\" src=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-tb9cOaJBuVo/UMze-YZbwaI/AAAAAAABk-o/N-RA7I8ieLA/s240/HaekelWallace-Aug4-04-23UnkownPkFromWallace.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Mt Fiske, west from the Wallace summit.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\r\n&lt;td&gt;&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-OmZk5QvEa8A/UMzfC637HfI/AAAAAAABk_I/6MeQJK4qBrA/s2000/HaekelWallace-Aug4-04-27WallaceSummit.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"\" src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-OmZk5QvEa8A/UMzfC637HfI/AAAAAAABk_I/6MeQJK4qBrA/s240/HaekelWallace-Aug4-04-27WallaceSummit.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;SW from Wallace Summit&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\r\n&lt;td&gt;&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-J1x-GktSbQ4/UMzfA6aO1JI/AAAAAAABk-4/lowrfpNcODY/s2000/HaekelWallace-Aug4-04-25PalisadesFromWallace.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"\" src=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-J1x-GktSbQ4/UMzfA6aO1JI/AAAAAAABk-4/lowrfpNcODY/s240/HaekelWallace-Aug4-04-25PalisadesFromWallace.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;S from Wallace Summit&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\r\n&lt;/tr&gt;\r\n&lt;/tbody&gt;\r\n&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;  The man was nice enough to sit on the opposing summit block and photograph us.

R.J. Secor described the route as &lt;i&gt;&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#156;Class 2. Loose scree makes this a good descent route. Caution is needed when crossing loose blocks near the top.&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#157; &lt;/i&gt; That was an understatement &amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#147; the slope was at the angle of repose and was an accident waiting to happen. I was the unfortunate one to be involved in that accident.\r\n  &lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n  Bob and Michael were ahead of me again as I descended the slopes. I didn&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;t know at what point they descended, so I gradually descended as I traversed south along the bowl at the top of the Southeast Slopes. The terrain was an odd mixture of loose sand and scree, with a lot of medium and large rocks scattered about in this shifting matrix. I found that it was easy to start skiing down the rocks since they were so loose, but I avoided the temptation since I didn&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;t know if Bob and Michael were below me.\r\n  &lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n  As I headed toward a subtle ridge to head down, I walked across a seemingly innocent open stretch on the slope and I stepped on a BIG booby trap. Suddenly I was sliding down the hill on a cushion of rocks. A patch about 20 ft by 20 ft around me suddenly let loose. Before I knew what was happening several suitcase-size rocks drifted together around my ankle, pinning me into the slide. As I began to accelerate I managed to grab onto a large boulder as I passed and held onto it for my life. Luckily I was pried free from the clutches of the larger rocks in the slide, and it swept past me with a deafening roar. By this point the rocks had picked up enough speed that the large blocks that had imprisoned me were ricocheting off of the walls of the chute below, setting off slide after slide.\r\n  &lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n  &amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#156;Rock! Rock! Rock!&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#157; I shouted at the top of my lungs, as if it wasn&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;t obvious what was happening. Soon the roar of the rock fall drowned out my warnings to Bob and Michael below. I felt awful and prayed that they had enough sense to be on a protrusion from the slopes by that time. The rocks just kept pouring and soon I couldn&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;t see the valley below as the dust from the rock fall began to rise up. An updraft blew the dust back up the slope and a wall of dust rose past me. As the rocks continued to pour the dust cloud, perhaps rising over 600 feet, became so thick that I couldn&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;t see further than 10 feet away.\r\n  &lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;&lt;table&gt;\r\n&lt;tbody&gt;\r\n&lt;tr&gt;\r\n&lt;td&gt;&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-6yK0cE9NuL0/UQVcYHyyiCI/AAAAAAABpS8/76DtAkDZdY0/s2000/DSC00043.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-6yK0cE9NuL0/UQVcYHyyiCI/AAAAAAABpS8/76DtAkDZdY0/s240/DSC00043.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Mark\'s rockslide on SE Face...

Bob let out a whistle and we all shouted to each other to make sure everyone was all right and to confirm where we all were. Luckily Bob and Michael had gotten onto some subtle ridges on the slope and were out of the line of fire.\r\n  &lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n  Needless to say I descended the rest of the slopes much more carefully. Each time a section of the slope began to give way I stopped my movement, paranoid of starting another large rock fall. Near the bottom of the slope I passed a couple of feet away from a rock the size of a hamper, and my disturbance of the soil supporting it caused it to roll toward me. I pushed back in vain as I tried to jump out of the way, and it rolled over my foot. After a few anguished howls, enough feeling returned to my foot to tell whether or not it was broken. Luckily the soil beneath my foot was soft enough to have protected my foot, so I limped on down the slope.\r\n  &lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n  By the time I reached the safety of flatter ground and was nearing Moonlight Lake I realized that Michael and Bob were far ahead of me. I also realized that I had no idea how far behind me Matthew was, and I really didn&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;t like the idea of waiting a long time at the trailhead for him to get down. Food, drinks, and a shower were just too appealing to wait for possibly another hour to have. I HAD to catch up with Bob and Michael before they left me to such a fate! I picked up the pace and once I was back on the trail I began jogging. I jogged on the down hills and some of the flat ground, and I hiked like a madman up the occasional hill. I figured that they were heading downhill at a fast 3 mph and had perhaps a half hour head start on me &amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#147; I had my work cut out for me.\r\n  &lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n  Despite my fatigue I pressed on as fast as I could. As I neared Dingleberry Lake I passed the volunteer trail maintenance crew again and inquired as to whether they had seen Bob and Michael. They said that they had seen the pair about 10 minutes earlier, so that meant that they were still probably another 20 minutes ahead of me &amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#147; I&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;d better pick up the pace!\r\n  &lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n  I ran down the trail, moving as fast as my feet would carry me. Hikers that I passed heading uphill probably thought that I was a madman. I asked a few if they had seen Bob and Michael, and each time they seemed to have seen them more recently. I was catching up! I was nearing Lake Sabrina when I had them down to about 10 minutes ahead of me. I had no idea if they would wait one minute for me at the trailhead, so time was running short. At one point I tripped, fell flat on my forearms, and immediately jumped back up and continued jogging.\r\n  &lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n  Finally I was at the home stretch and I bounded off the trail and down the dirt road to where the cars were parked. And then there was my salvation &amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#147; the car was there! Bob and Michael were still unpacking their gear in preparation to leave. I had arrived about 5 minutes behind them. Panting, I dropped onto some grass beside the car in relief.\r\n  &lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n  Bob and Michael seemed amused at my exhausted state, for reasons I wouldn&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;t know until Bob wrote his trip report of the event. They had mercifully planned on waiting for me! I felt so satisfied having caught up to them that it was probably for the best that they didn&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;t ruin the moment by telling me.\r\n  &lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;hr&gt;\r\n&lt;hr&gt;\r\n&lt;h2&gt;\r\n&lt;a name=\"TOC-Links\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Links&lt;/h2&gt;\r\n&lt;ul&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://picasaweb.google.com/105894936663116565516/20040804SierraChallengeHaeckelWallace?authuser=0&amp;amp;feat=directlink\"&gt;Picasa Photos&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://www.snwburd.com/bob/trip_reports/haeckel_1.html\"&gt;Bob Burd\'s Sierra Challenge TR &amp;amp; Photos&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://www.summitpost.org/my-first-sierra-challenge-2004/169860\"&gt;SummitPost TR&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;/ul&gt;\r\n&lt;hr&gt;\r\n&lt;hr&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"http://www.markpthomas.com/mountaineering/trip-reports/california/my-first-sierra-challenge-2004\"&gt;2004 Sierra Challenge&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"http://www.markpthomas.com/mountaineering/trip-reports/california/nw-ridge-of-n-pk-and-n-ridge-of-mt-conness\"&gt;Day 1: North Peak &amp;amp; Mt Conness&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"http://www.markpthomas.com/mountaineering/trip-reports/california/mt-lyell-mt-maclure\"&gt;Day 2: Mt Lyell &amp;amp; Mt Maclure&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"http://www.markpthomas.com/mountaineering/trip-reports/california/basin-mtn-e-chute\"&gt;Day 4: Basin Mtn - Four Gables Traverse&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n-&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"http://www.markpthomas.com/mountaineering/trip-reports/california/mt-winchell-e-arete\"&gt;Day 6: Mt Winchell&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"http://www.markpthomas.com/mountaineering/trip-reports/california/mt-jepson-palisade-crest\"&gt;Day 7: Palisade Crest &amp;amp; Mt Jepson&lt;/a&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;/div&gt; \r\n'),(86,72,'/mountaineering/trip-reports/california/mt-winchell-e-arete','Day 6: Mt Winchell','2004 Sierra Challenge - Day 6: Mt Winchell, East Arete','Trip_Report','content: &lt;div dir=\"ltr\"&gt;\r\n&lt;h1&gt;\r\n&lt;a name=\"TOC-2004-Sierra-Challenge---Day-6:-Mt-Winchell-East-Arete\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;2004 Sierra Challenge - Day 6: Mt Winchell, East Arete&lt;/h1&gt;\r\n&lt;h2&gt;\r\n&lt;a name=\"TOC-August-5th-2004\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;August 5th, 2004&lt;/h2&gt;\r\n&lt;hr&gt;\r\n&lt;hr&gt;\r\n&lt;table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"2\" cellspacing=\"1\" width=\"97%\"&gt;\r\n&lt;tbody&gt;\r\n&lt;tr&gt;\r\n&lt;td width=\"48%\"&gt;\r\n&lt;font color=\"BLUE\"&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;b&gt;Stats&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/font&gt;\r\n&lt;ul&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;Routes:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href=\"http://www.summitpost.org/show/route_link.pl/route_id/650/object_id/1015\"&gt;East Arete&lt;/a&gt;\r\n&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;Elevation Gained:&lt;/b&gt; 6,044\'  \r\n&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;RT Distance:&lt;/b&gt; 17 mi  \r\n&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;RT Time:&lt;/b&gt; 8hr 30min&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;Trailhead:&lt;/b&gt; Big Pine  \r\n&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;Summit Elevs.:&lt;/b&gt; 13,768\'      \r\n&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;Rating:&lt;/b&gt; Class 3  \r\n&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;/ul&gt;\r\n&lt;/td&gt;\r\n&lt;td width=\"52%\"&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-RrGtcT7UAkU/UMzd21np5yI/AAAAAAABk2Y/a56tX1WVVkM/s2000/MtWinchell-Aug5-04-5MtWinchell.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img height=\"250\" src=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-RrGtcT7UAkU/UMzd21np5yI/AAAAAAABk2Y/a56tX1WVVkM/s800/MtWinchell-Aug5-04-5MtWinchell.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;/td&gt;\r\n&lt;/tr&gt;\r\n&lt;/tbody&gt;\r\n&lt;/table&gt;\r\n&lt;hr&gt;\r\n&lt;hr&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;It was 5 am and we were all ready to go at the Big Pine trailhead. The day&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;s challengers for climbing Mt Winchell&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;s East Ridge were Bob, Michael, Matthew, Joe, Michelle, and me. Some of the others had planned on having an easier day and were climbing nearby Mt Agassiz from a different trailhead. &lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n  We started out hiking with headlamps, but hardly a half hour went by before we had enough morning glow from the rising sun to dispense with them. We quickly covered the first set of switchbacks climbing into the north fork and were across the following flats and up the tedious broad switchbacks in no time. I was familiar with this approach as I had climbed 14,000 ft Mt Sill nearly a year earlier with Dirk Summers and Joe Wilson. Last time we hauled in heavy packs laden with climbing gear to attempt the 5.8 Swiss Arete, and we spent a full day on the approach, camping in Sam Mack Meadow. This time I was breezing along the trail with barely 25 lbs in my daypack.\r\n  &lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n  I was amazed at the comparative difference in progress we made. What had before seemed like a long approach was merely a short stroll along a shaded creek, with barely a glimpse of First, Second, and Third Lakes. Bob, Michelle, and Joe had fallen behind and Matthew had disappeared in the lead, while Michael and I hiked together. We left the main trail just above Third Lake and crossed a marsh before hiking up the final set of switchbacks to gain Sam Mack Meadow.\r\n  &lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n  The meadow was really a &amp;Acirc;&amp;frac12; mile deep box-shaped notch cut dramatically into the granite cliffs below the Palisade Glacier. The flatness of the lush green ground was a striking contrast to the bare vertical palisades of crystalline granite surrounding the meadow &amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#147; it was definitely one of the most beautiful base camps that I had the privilege to stay in when I was last here.\r\n  &lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n  Matthew had reached the meadow about 10 minutes before me and Michael, and we regrouped and took a short food and water break while we waited for Bob to catch up. About 5 minutes later he arrived, but Joe and Michelle were nowhere to be seen. Apparently Michelle had been suffering on and off from a knee injury during the trip and had to slow down. Joe stayed with her.\r\n  &lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n  Next was the problem of getting out of the meadow, which unexpectedly turned out to be the crux of the route. A cascade cut through the cliffs on the northwest end, and we scrambled up the talus and boulders along the side of the stream. This drainage had been in shade enough that it was covered in a thick layer of snow undercut by the stream. This large tongue of snow kept us on the right side of the stream. Suddenly we got to a point where the rocks were completely covered in a thin veneer of verglass. They had been drenched from the spraying water and there was not one patch that had not been iced over.\r\n  &lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n  After searching around for an ice free way, I decided to just climb up the verglass &amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#147; I carefully wedged my feet in the interstices of the rocks to prevent them from slipping out and climbed to the left of a large boulder, right into the spray of the stream. Soon I was through the icy section, and my hands were drenched and cold. Luckily I hadn&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;t gotten too wet. As the others followed I continued up the drainage.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;table border=\"0\" width=\"200\"&gt;\r\n&lt;tbody&gt;\r\n&lt;tr&gt;\r\n&lt;td&gt;&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-h9M5hMWLIEQ/UMzdzG4TdfI/AAAAAAABk2A/6oFBoNlk4Q0/s2000/MtWinchell-Aug5-04-2MtSill.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-h9M5hMWLIEQ/UMzdzG4TdfI/AAAAAAABk2A/6oFBoNlk4Q0/s240/MtWinchell-Aug5-04-2MtSill.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Mt Sill seen from just above Sam Mac Meadow.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\r\n&lt;td&gt;&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-MLdAZ3CdEhk/UMzd0C_D4PI/AAAAAAABk2I/1DVDBFZjoy4/s2000/MtWinchell-Aug5-04-3MtSill%2526VCouloir.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-MLdAZ3CdEhk/UMzd0C_D4PI/AAAAAAABk2I/1DVDBFZjoy4/s240/MtWinchell-Aug5-04-3MtSill%2526VCouloir.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Mt Sill &amp;amp; The V Notch Couloir&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\r\n&lt;td&gt;&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-lxMFbcSDyIw/UMzdxsw-mzI/AAAAAAABk14/RXgp4PSZmVI/s2000/MtWinchell-Aug5-04-1ThunderboltPk.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-lxMFbcSDyIw/UMzdxsw-mzI/AAAAAAABk14/RXgp4PSZmVI/s240/MtWinchell-Aug5-04-1ThunderboltPk.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;The north side of Thunderbolt Pk seen from just above Sam Mac Meadow.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\r\n&lt;/tr&gt;\r\n&lt;/tbody&gt;\r\n&lt;/table&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;\r\n&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-qn9HJ-RipSg/UMzd1mRC80I/AAAAAAABk2Q/FuThw52TPi4/s2000/MtWinchell-Aug5-04-4ThundernoltPk.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-qn9HJ-RipSg/UMzd1mRC80I/AAAAAAABk2Q/FuThw52TPi4/s800/MtWinchell-Aug5-04-4ThundernoltPk.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;The north side of Thunderbolt Pk seen from just above Sam Mack Meadow.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\n\r\nUp above was a wonderland of vertical granite cliffs rising above a contrastingly flat drainage bottom composed of multi-leveled granite slabs, with the stream winding its way down the middle. Once again I felt like I was in southern Utah again, familiar territory. Rather than give up my lead, I whipped out the topo map that I brought along, referenced it visually with the slabs, ledges, and cliffs all around, and chose a route. After many years scrambling in similar terrain in the southwest, I had an intuitive grasp of how the rock would go, where to go to stay above the rough boulders in the stream bed without getting cliffed out on the slabs above.\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\nI took off up a ramp to the left. I kept my eyes peeled and found a nice series of slabs that took me over to an unnamed lake at 11,800 ft with little elevation gain or loss. I circled around the south and west sides before scrambling up the unpleasantly loose moraine of the Thunderbolt Glacier. At about this time Bob, Michael, and Matthew reached the outlet of the lake. Because of the arrangement of the cliffs, they had to pass around the north side and we met up at a point where the drainage began to narrow again.\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-RrGtcT7UAkU/UMzd21np5yI/AAAAAAABk2Y/a56tX1WVVkM/s2000/MtWinchell-Aug5-04-5MtWinchell.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-RrGtcT7UAkU/UMzd21np5yI/AAAAAAABk2Y/a56tX1WVVkM/s800/MtWinchell-Aug5-04-5MtWinchell.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Mt Winchell\'s East Arete seen on the approach.

The bottom buttress was heavily broken, so instead of traveling around to the south to gain the ridge, as the route had been described, we climbed straight up the ridge from where it rose up from the landscape. The class 1-2 slabs soon turned to mild class 3 as we climbed higher. After ascending about 1,000 feet we reached a large bowl to the left of the ridge. This bowl provided an easier bypass around some of the more rugged parts of the ridge near the top, so we began climbing the stepped ledges contouring the slope. The enjoyable class 3 climbing was steep and somewhat exposed, and we gained elevation quickly, reaching the summit by noon.\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&amp;Acirc;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;&lt;table border=\"0\" width=\"200\"&gt;\r\n&lt;tbody&gt;\r\n&lt;tr&gt;\r\n&lt;td&gt;&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-9gAsVVY2JXw/UMzeBNMozBI/AAAAAAABk3Y/22Eq_j1bXeA/s2000/MtWinchell-Aug5-04-13EastRidge.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-9gAsVVY2JXw/UMzeBNMozBI/AAAAAAABk3Y/22Eq_j1bXeA/s400/MtWinchell-Aug5-04-13EastRidge.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Looking down the East Arete of Mt Winchell.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\r\n&lt;td&gt;&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-jAYlHnNV4hc/UMzeCRAQQ6I/AAAAAAABk3g/xxolFsynq3U/s2000/MtWinchell-Aug5-04-14MtSill%2526ThunderboltPk.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-jAYlHnNV4hc/UMzeCRAQQ6I/AAAAAAABk3g/xxolFsynq3U/s400/MtWinchell-Aug5-04-14MtSill%2526ThunderboltPk.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Mt Sill, Thunderbolt Pk, and Starlight Pk seen from the East Arete of Mt Winchell.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\r\n&lt;/tr&gt;\r\n&lt;tr&gt;\r\n&lt;td&gt;&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-X0CDA_jVVaQ/UMzeDjY1dbI/AAAAAAABk3o/ZCISgt0HPyM/s2000/MtWinchell-Aug5-04-15MtGayley%2526MtSill.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-X0CDA_jVVaQ/UMzeDjY1dbI/AAAAAAABk3o/ZCISgt0HPyM/s400/MtWinchell-Aug5-04-15MtGayley%2526MtSill.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Mt Gayley and Mt Sill seen from the summit.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\r\n&lt;td&gt;&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-3KjW-s8JuB4/UMzeEhZW0RI/AAAAAAABk3w/VP5yHhOPWtI/s2000/MtWinchell-Aug5-04-16EastRidge%2526NForkOfBigPine.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-3KjW-s8JuB4/UMzeEhZW0RI/AAAAAAABk3w/VP5yHhOPWtI/s400/MtWinchell-Aug5-04-16EastRidge%2526NForkOfBigPine.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;The North Fork of Big Pine seen from the summit of Mt Winchell.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\r\n&lt;/tr&gt;\r\n&lt;/tbody&gt;\r\n&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\nAfter we signed the summit register we noticed some figures standing atop the summit of nearby Mt Agassiz. We figured these climbers were the other participants in the Challenge who had gone to climb the peak. We gave a wave but got no noticeable response (Apparently it wasn&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;t them. In later conversation in Big Pine that night we learned that the others summitted about an hour later in the day). As we rested our legs and enjoyed the view I read through the summit register. One entry that got my attention was one made in memory of a climber who had been killed climbing on Mt Winchell a year earlier. He was a college student not much older than me, making the connection between us even closer. It was somewhat chilling to come across this summit post, which was certainly a reminder of the harshness of the mountain environment that we were playing in.\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-DUx9-MDHZNQ/UMzeFq3e0XI/AAAAAAABk5Y/ceSXbowXi4U/s2000/MtWinchell-Aug5-04-17Lake.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-DUx9-MDHZNQ/UMzeFq3e0XI/AAAAAAABk5Y/ceSXbowXi4U/s800/MtWinchell-Aug5-04-17Lake.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Glacier fed lake on the descent back to Sam Mac Meadows.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\nAfter spending about 15 minutes on the summit, we headed down. Bob gained ground, down climbing faster than the rest of us. As we descended I kept eyeing a large snow-filled couloir on the north side of Thunderbolt Peak. It looked like a rather nice way up the mountain, and since I had planned on climbing it within the next year or so, I mentally filed this route away as I scoped it out from our high vantage point.\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\nAs we headed down Michael soon left me and Matthew behind. As we neared Sam Mack Meadow I wasn&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;t too happy about down climbing the icy rock that we had come up, and I had remembered spying a possible break in the cliffs just south of where we exited the meadows, so on our descent we stayed on a ridge to the south of where we had come up. The terrain continued to slope away from beneath us, but we always seemed to find a route down through the ledges. The final 20 ft was a mildly exposed class 3-4 down climb over a couple of ledges before reaching the flat ground of the meadows. Soon we were there.\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\nMatthew and I made good time hiking briskly back to the trailhead, arriving at the cars about 5 minutes later than Bob and Michael. We had covered in 9.5 hours what had been a full day&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;s approach (and then some) during my last visit! My legs were a little fatigued, but they still had plenty of energy left in them. I was rather happy with myself for doing better than I had hoped on the Challenge. I seemed to be able to stay up with the lead group, and rather than tiring me out, the day to day hiking seemed to be working me into a good pace that I could sustain.\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;hr&gt;\r\n&lt;hr&gt;\r\n&lt;h2&gt;\r\n&lt;a name=\"TOC-Links\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Links&lt;/h2&gt;\r\n&lt;ul&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://picasaweb.google.com/105894936663116565516/20040805SierraChallengeWinchellEArete?authuser=0&amp;amp;feat=directlink\"&gt;Picasa Photos&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://www.snwburd.com/bob/trip_reports/winchell_1.html\"&gt;Bob Burd\'s Sierra Challenge TR &amp;amp; Photos&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://www.summitpost.org/my-first-sierra-challenge-2004/169860\"&gt;SummitPost TR&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;/ul&gt;\r\n&lt;hr&gt;\r\n&lt;hr&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"http://www.markpthomas.com/mountaineering/trip-reports/california/my-first-sierra-challenge-2004\"&gt;2004 Sierra Challenge&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"http://www.markpthomas.com/mountaineering/trip-reports/california/nw-ridge-of-n-pk-and-n-ridge-of-mt-conness\"&gt;Day 1: North Peak &amp;amp; Mt Conness&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"http://www.markpthomas.com/mountaineering/trip-reports/california/mt-lyell-mt-maclure\"&gt;Day 2: Mt Lyell &amp;amp; Mt Maclure&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"http://www.markpthomas.com/mountaineering/trip-reports/california/basin-mtn-e-chute\"&gt;Day 4: Basin Mtn - Four Gables Traverse&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"http://www.markpthomas.com/mountaineering/trip-reports/california/mt-haeckel-mt-wallace\"&gt;Day 5: Mt Haeckel &amp;amp; Mt Wallace&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n-&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"http://www.markpthomas.com/mountaineering/trip-reports/california/mt-jepson-palisade-crest\"&gt;Day 7: Palisade Crest &amp;amp; Mt Jepson&lt;/a&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;/div&gt; \r\n');

The night before, I began to be overcome with a feeling of dread. I had seen photos of the route beforehand, and it was awesomely exposed. By climbing with a rope, I knew that it would be exciting, but we were going to free-solo the route. It was only class 3 along the most exposed part, and the class 4 ramp at the end was reportedly easier to deal with than the class 3 traverse. I was excited to be climbing such as awesome peak, but this feeling that something bad was going to happen kept getting worse. After experiencing minor injuries in a fall on Basin Mountain 3 days earlier and narrowly escaping a monster rock slide on Mt Wallace 2 days before, my nerves were a little tense for good reason.\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;h2&gt;\r\n&lt;a name=\"TOC-Hike-to-Scimitar-Pass\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Hike to Scimitar Pass&lt;/h2&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-znjTtbuIrSM/UMzfK_IbFOI/AAAAAAABlAE/eGMtFkN_gUE/s2000/PalisadeCrest-Aug6th-05-2PalisadeCrestLabels.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-znjTtbuIrSM/UMzfK_IbFOI/AAAAAAABlAE/eGMtFkN_gUE/s600/PalisadeCrest-Aug6th-05-2PalisadeCrestLabels.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Sunrise on the Palisade Crest, Mt Jepson &amp;amp; Mt Sill.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n  \r\n  Like the day before when we climbed Mt Winchell, we were departing the Big Pine trailhead at 5:10 am. Today Bob, Michael, Matthew, Joe , Daryn, and I were the only ones attempting the Palisade Crest. This time we headed past the first set of switchbacks and straight up the south fork of Big Pine creek. Soon we began a tedious series of switchbacks winding up a 600 foot headwall. This ascent went by easily and soon we reached flatter ground again. The sun was just rising and a beautiful alpenglow washed over Middle Palisade and the Palisade Crest. This lasted only a moment before it was gone and we continued on our way. We descended a hill and then left the trail to begin heading up a western spur of the south drainage to reach Elinore Lake. The going soon got tough as the trail disappeared. We wound our way through tall grasses, crossing the myriad of streams snaking through the flats before finally reaching class 2 boulder hopping on the north side of the stream. Bob had disappeared, but after climbing up the boulders a few minutes we spotted him a little behind us, on the overgrown south side of the stream. Apparently we had picked the better route this time, and Bob hopped over to our side.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;&lt;table border=\"0\" width=\"200\"&gt;\r\n&lt;tbody&gt;\r\n&lt;tr&gt;\r\n&lt;td&gt;&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-efPkPcjREQY/UMzfMwnEjHI/AAAAAAABlAU/tGBdylUMGbQ/s2000/PalisadeCrest-Aug6th-05-3MtWilliamsLabels.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-efPkPcjREQY/UMzfMwnEjHI/AAAAAAABlAU/tGBdylUMGbQ/s400/PalisadeCrest-Aug6th-05-3MtWilliamsLabels.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Mount Williams&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\r\n&lt;td&gt;&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-EmWIJQ8591w/UMzfNz5xnTI/AAAAAAABlAc/fMKYbpTl_nk/s2000/PalisadeCrest-Aug6th-05-4PalisadeCrestFromElinoreLake.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-EmWIJQ8591w/UMzfNz5xnTI/AAAAAAABlAc/fMKYbpTl_nk/s400/PalisadeCrest-Aug6th-05-4PalisadeCrestFromElinoreLake.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Palisade Crest from Elinore Lake&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\r\n&lt;/tr&gt;\r\n&lt;/tbody&gt;\r\n&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;\r\n&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-Q-zykj5S0-g/UMzfQEVHvmI/AAAAAAABlAw/Lvm89z8viPk/s2000/PalisadeCrest-Aug6th-05-5NormanClydePkFromElinoreLakeLabels.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-Q-zykj5S0-g/UMzfQEVHvmI/AAAAAAABlAw/Lvm89z8viPk/s600/PalisadeCrest-Aug6th-05-5NormanClydePkFromElinoreLakeLabels.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Norman Clyde Peak seen from Elinore Lake.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n  A while later we parted company with Bob and Matthew &amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#147; they followed the stream all the way to Elinore Lake, but Joe, Michael, and I opten to take a shortcut up a dividing ridge. Daryn continued up the drainage since he had decided to climb Mt Gayler and Temple Crag from the south instead of joining us on the Palisade Crest. The shortcut worked nicely as the ground was mostly clear of vegetation and we were able to scramble straight up to the shores of Elinore Lake, reaching it just as Bob and Matthew came around the corner. We hopped along the granite boulders along the eastern shore and then began climbing some steep class 2 slabs. They reminded me a lot of Bob&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;s aptly named &amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#152;Slabs &amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#152;O Plenty&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153; we crossed on our way up Mt Lyell 5 days earlier. We aimed towards the end of a spur coming off the crest. The spur stuck out dramatically, like the bow of a huge ship driving its way through the rocky valley below.&amp;Acirc;&amp;nbsp;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-U8iGb6XeFec/UMzfRVbpcwI/AAAAAAABlA4/uOy4xaoEH1U/s2000/PalisadeCrest-Aug6th-05-6NormanClydePkfromNearSchimitarPass.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-U8iGb6XeFec/UMzfRVbpcwI/AAAAAAABlA4/uOy4xaoEH1U/s600/PalisadeCrest-Aug6th-05-6NormanClydePkfromNearSchimitarPass.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Norman Clyde Peak seen on the approach to Scimitar Pass.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n  At the subtle saddle at the end of this prow, we crossed over to the south side of the ridge. From there we had a full view of the impressive east face of Norman Clyde Peak, dropping over a 1,000 vertical feet straight down to the Norman Clyde Glacier. A ways over was the Palisade Crest, although I couldn&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;t tell which peak was Gandalf Pk yet. We scrambled up some ugly loose sand and scree composing a moraine of some unnamed glacier, and then traversed above the glacier, angling up towards a break in the impediment of cliffs known as Scimitar Pass. For some reason this name seemed very fitting to me, due to the lethally rugged terrain surrounding it and the brutal cross country approach required to get to it. By just reaching the pass we covered more ground than one would need to climb a Sierra Peak!&amp;Acirc;&amp;nbsp;\r\n\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-S0GcDZ4YYfo/UMzfUA7yuoI/AAAAAAABlBU/Ghh9uBH03uk/s2000/PalisadeCrest-Aug6th-05-9PalisadeCrest.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-S0GcDZ4YYfo/UMzfUA7yuoI/AAAAAAABlBU/Ghh9uBH03uk/s600/PalisadeCrest-Aug6th-05-9PalisadeCrest.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Palisade Crest from glacier&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;&lt;table border=\"0\" width=\"200\"&gt;\r\n&lt;tbody&gt;\r\n&lt;tr&gt;\r\n&lt;td&gt;&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-XGL8Nkp5Nt4/UMzfqfIWJHI/AAAAAAABlD4/-qYjEGvv09w/s2000/PalisadeCrest-Aug6th-05-27PalisadeCrest.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-XGL8Nkp5Nt4/UMzfqfIWJHI/AAAAAAABlD4/-qYjEGvv09w/s400/PalisadeCrest-Aug6th-05-27PalisadeCrest.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Palisade Crest seen from the glacier/snowfield below Scimitar Pass.

Now all we had was a relatively short scrambling traverse to reach Gandalf Peak! Joe announced that he was going to split off from the group to climb nearby Mt Jepson and then head down. He felt that the exposure of the climb up Gandalf Peak would be too much for him and he didn&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;t want to get in over his head. This was perplexing to Matthew and Michael, since Joe could climb 5.10, well above their abilities, and yet he was too scared to attempt a class 3-4 route without a rope. Of course climbing proficiency and acceptance of risk don&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;t necessarily correlate, so it made sense to me.\r\n&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;Acirc;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;&lt;table border=\"0\" width=\"200\"&gt;\r\n&lt;tbody&gt;\r\n&lt;tr&gt;\r\n&lt;td&gt;&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-tmU03qBjxC0/UMzfTFOtyoI/AAAAAAABlBM/RKJaJWbLQ60/s2000/PalisadeCrest-Aug6th-05-8MtGayley%2526MtSillFromScimitarPass.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-tmU03qBjxC0/UMzfTFOtyoI/AAAAAAABlBM/RKJaJWbLQ60/s400/PalisadeCrest-Aug6th-05-8MtGayley%2526MtSillFromScimitarPass.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Mt Gayley &amp;amp; Mt Sill from Scimitar Pass&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\r\n&lt;td&gt;&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-0VY-qDVs1vI/UMzfVLf5YcI/AAAAAAABlBc/qiHEqlaxM20/s2000/PalisadeCrest-Aug6th-05-10PolemoniumPk%2526MtSill.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-0VY-qDVs1vI/UMzfVLf5YcI/AAAAAAABlBc/qiHEqlaxM20/s400/PalisadeCrest-Aug6th-05-10PolemoniumPk%2526MtSill.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;The bone dry bare slopes of Mt Sill and Polemonium, seen from Scimitar Pass (from the south).

The scrambling was thrilling, but it was also barely within my comfort level. We dropped repeatedly to the east, and then climbed class 3 rock back up to the ridge. At one point we walked along the spine of the ridge with big vertical drop offs on both sides. The rock was flat, about the width of a sidewalk, and angled at about 15 degrees towards the 60 foot drop off to the West. At a notch in the sky high sidewalk Michael and Matthew just hopped over the gap. I was sketched out enough that I climbed into the notch and up the other side &amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#147; I&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;d really rather not risk the consequences if I tripped on my landing on the far side. As the exposure increased I became increasingly worried, and I kept thinking of different scenarios of falling off of the ridge. &lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;&lt;table border=\"0\" width=\"200\"&gt;\r\n&lt;tbody&gt;\r\n&lt;tr&gt;\r\n&lt;td&gt;&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-1bH0vMpDoYk/UMzfWPbXFlI/AAAAAAABlBk/n5EGOzdMmyU/s2000/PalisadeCrest-Aug6th-05-11BeginningThePalisadeCrest.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-1bH0vMpDoYk/UMzfWPbXFlI/AAAAAAABlBk/n5EGOzdMmyU/s400/PalisadeCrest-Aug6th-05-11BeginningThePalisadeCrest.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Heading up the beginning of the Palisade Crest from Scimitar Pass&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\r\n&lt;td&gt;&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-uBu6pmdh4cY/UMzfaM1fHlI/AAAAAAABlBw/-ozTUvtsXmY/s2000/PalisadeCrest-Aug6th-05-12MichaelPalisadeCrestClimbing.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-uBu6pmdh4cY/UMzfaM1fHlI/AAAAAAABlBw/-ozTUvtsXmY/s400/PalisadeCrest-Aug6th-05-12MichaelPalisadeCrestClimbing.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Michael Graup climbing along the class 3 portion of the Palisade Crest.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\r\n&lt;/tr&gt;\r\n&lt;/tbody&gt;\r\n&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\nThen we reached the route finding crux of the ridge. The class 3 scramble dropped us down onto the +1,000 ft high east face as it headed toward a prominent notch in the ridge. From there all we had was the class 4 ramp that wound its way up the backside of Gandalf Peak. The summit block was amazing. The rock was shaped like a sagging wizard hat &amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#147; a very surreal shape to see on a mountain top. This silhouette belonged in cartoons and claymations, not in real life! The summit was named after the elf, Gandalf, in J.R.R Tolkien&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;s &amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#152;The Hobbit&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;, and apparently the other 11 spires on the ridge were named after other characters in his stories.\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;&lt;table border=\"0\" width=\"200\"&gt;\r\n&lt;tbody&gt;\r\n&lt;tr&gt;\r\n&lt;td&gt;&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-2n2-juWhB4A/UMzfeD1DTPI/AAAAAAABlCM/JyujDxquACI/s2000/PalisadeCrest-Aug6th-05-14GandalfPkLongShot2.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-2n2-juWhB4A/UMzfeD1DTPI/AAAAAAABlCM/JyujDxquACI/s400/PalisadeCrest-Aug6th-05-14GandalfPkLongShot2.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Michael Graupe climbing along the class 3 portion of the Palisade Crest.

The looseness of the rock added to my anxiety &amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#147; while the terrain was easy to walk and scramble through, it seemed very easy to slip or fall as the loose rock gave way, as it did on Basin Mountain and Mt Haekel. I climbed down the ledges facing into the hill, and I made the mistake of looking down. As I down climbed I could see the unnamed glacier we had passed over earlier peeking between my legs, over 1,000 feet below. My sense of vertigo increased and I stopped to recompose myself at a sheltered notch and chock stone along the east face.\r\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;&lt;table border=\"0\" width=\"200\"&gt;\r\n&lt;tbody&gt;\r\n&lt;tr&gt;\r\n&lt;td&gt;&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-SMt41rp4psU/UMzffCyXQeI/AAAAAAABlCY/BaQt_V4hvNQ/s2000/PalisadeCrest-Aug6th-05-15BobOnGandelfPk.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-SMt41rp4psU/UMzffCyXQeI/AAAAAAABlCY/BaQt_V4hvNQ/s400/PalisadeCrest-Aug6th-05-15BobOnGandelfPk.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Bob on Gandalf Pk, above the cl. 4 crux.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\r\n&lt;td&gt;&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-iR9M_csZpjA/UMzfg2WcCtI/AAAAAAABlCo/-aqSk1geRxY/s2000/PalisadeCrest-Aug6th-05-17MichaelOnPalisadeCrest.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-iR9M_csZpjA/UMzfg2WcCtI/AAAAAAABlCo/-aqSk1geRxY/s400/PalisadeCrest-Aug6th-05-17MichaelOnPalisadeCrest.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Michael Graup on the Palisade Crest.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\r\n&lt;/tr&gt;\r\n&lt;/tbody&gt;\r\n&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n  Michael and Matthew were having a difficult time route finding, and the cairns scattered around didn&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;t help much. The kept climbing farther down, closer to the precipice, and were slowly making progress to the notch. I could see Bob standing atop the ramp beyond. I took some photos and then re-evaluated the situation. This last 150 ft before the notch was the last of the most exposed scrambling on the ridge, and it really wasn&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;t too bad, apart from the &lt;i&gt;&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#152;splat&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;&lt;/i&gt; factor. I could probably make it across. Then I looked down again, and my vertigo worsened. I could probably make it across, but it would be hell coming back! As much as I desperately wanted to summit, I just couldn&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;t bear the though of having to retrace all of this terrain, and I froze. Matthew and Michael had found the route by then and beckoned me to follow. I knew that I was too scared to continue climbing safely, so I reluctantly told them that I was turning back. They insisted that I climb just a bit further, but I declined and headed back along the ridge.\r\n  &lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-4xd_X8l5M_8/UQdYPi3GIPI/AAAAAAABp3g/3tx6JLi4EzI/s2000/DSC00019.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-4xd_X8l5M_8/UQdYPi3GIPI/AAAAAAABp3g/3tx6JLi4EzI/s600/DSC00019.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Michael, Matthew, Mark on the traverse (by Bob Burd)&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n  I was pissed that I had turned around. I really wanted to climb Gandalf Peak and it was easily within my climbing ability. I just couldn&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;t handle the exposure as a free-solo. It was embarrassing having turned around on a class 3 route, and I resolved to return with a rope and complete the climb. I knew that the ridge traverse was rated 5.5, so I could do the traverse for more enjoyment and as an excuse to have a rope for the sketchy parts.&amp;Acirc;&amp;nbsp;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\r\n&lt;div&gt;(Note: In 2010 I unsuccessfully attempted this traverse. In 2013 I completed it. It was much harder 5.5 - more like 5.8. It was a spectacular climb: &lt;a href=\"http://www.markpthomas.com/mountaineering/trip-reports/california/palisade-crest-n-s-traverse\"&gt;Trip Report&lt;/a&gt;) &amp;Acirc;&amp;nbsp;&amp;Acirc;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;h2&gt;\r\n&lt;a name=\"TOC-Mt-Jepson-Descent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Mt Jepson &amp;amp; Descent&lt;/h2&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;I made my way back along the ridge slowly, but easier than when coming. I felt defeated, but I didn&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;t want this long approach to be a waste &amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#147; I decided to climb Mt Jepson before heading down Scimitar Pass. &lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\nIt was at about this time that I heard a noise behind me. I turned around to catch Bob trying to sneak up on me. I waited for him to join me and told him regretfully of my choice to turn around, and my intent t at least bag Jepson. He was up for that and we headed toward the peak. Then we heard more voices.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;table border=\"0\" width=\"200\"&gt;\r\n&lt;tbody&gt;\r\n&lt;tr&gt;\r\n&lt;td&gt;&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-ZRQPRlK1sDU/UQdYuVEfA4I/AAAAAAABp5k/0po7H9I6xrc/s2000/DSC00043.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-ZRQPRlK1sDU/UQdYuVEfA4I/AAAAAAABp5k/0po7H9I6xrc/s400/DSC00043.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Mark on summit of Jepson (by Bob Burd)&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\r\n&lt;td&gt;&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-jNmIrI7Z-jA/UQdY0F9NrJI/AAAAAAABp50/eP5EvKxqEL0/s2000/DSC00042.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"\" src=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-jNmIrI7Z-jA/UQdY0F9NrJI/AAAAAAABp50/eP5EvKxqEL0/s400/DSC00042.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Mona and Megan nearing Scimitar Pass (by Bob Burd)&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\r\n&lt;/tr&gt;\r\n&lt;/tbody&gt;\r\n&lt;/table&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n  Like sirens luring us off the cliffs, two mysterious ladies appeared over a bulge in the talus slopes below. Were we hallucinating?! Who would be coming up to Scimitar Pass from the West?! We greeted them and chatted for a while. Actually, Bob chatted and I just sat there. I was still a little shaken up from the Palisade Crest and couldn&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;t think of anything to say. Apparently these two ladies had been backpacking in the High Sierras for the past 10 days and they were hiking out over Scimitar Pass to pick up a food cache at the Big Pine trailhead before returning to the backcountry, passing back through Scimitar Pass. Quite the detour!&amp;Acirc;&amp;nbsp;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-k1qmS8yZxaA/UMzfhswr_LI/AAAAAAABlCw/Vx7D4MBdSY4/s2000/PalisadeCrest-Aug6th-05-18MtSillFromMtJepson.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-k1qmS8yZxaA/UMzfhswr_LI/AAAAAAABlCw/Vx7D4MBdSY4/s600/PalisadeCrest-Aug6th-05-18MtSillFromMtJepson.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Mt Sill seen from the summit of Mount Jepson&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;&lt;table border=\"0\" width=\"200\"&gt;\r\n&lt;tbody&gt;\r\n&lt;tr&gt;\r\n&lt;td&gt;&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-eh_A_fRDr5c/UMzfj9gAsHI/AAAAAAABlDA/kjSFU6eBkXY/s2000/PalisadeCrest-Aug6th-05-20PalisadeCrestFromMtJepson.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-eh_A_fRDr5c/UMzfj9gAsHI/AAAAAAABlDA/kjSFU6eBkXY/s400/PalisadeCrest-Aug6th-05-20PalisadeCrestFromMtJepson.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Palisade Crest seen from the summit of Mt Jepson (from the north).

Bob and I scrambled up the class 2 slopes of Mt Jepson and were soon on the summit. From there we had some very nice views of the Palisade Crest to the south and the backsides of Mt Sill and Mt Polemonium to the north. We happily signed the register and laughed at Joe&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;s entry. He had made it here earlier and had written a very strange entry in the summit log. Then we headed back toward Scimitar Pass, reaching it at about the same time as Michael and Matthew.&amp;Acirc;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n  We happily told them of the sirens we had encountered, but they were skeptical. As we headed down Scimitar Pass we took to some glissading on the glacier to avoid the class 2 boulders on the side and were soon at the moraine. The ladies we had met earlier were also at the moraine, having lunch. Now Michael and Matthew were convinced. They all chatted for a while, and I remained awkwardly silent since once again I couldn&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;t think of anything to say, and then we parted ways again.&amp;Acirc;&amp;nbsp;\r\n  &lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-85dJ0HnTqvY/UQdYybPU77I/AAAAAAABp5s/jgBytDTZY8s/s2000/DSC00047.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-85dJ0HnTqvY/UQdYybPU77I/AAAAAAABp5s/jgBytDTZY8s/s600/DSC00047.jpg\" style=\"border-width:0px;background-color:transparent\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Mona and Megan having lunch (by Bob Burd)&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n  Back at Elinore Lake our group paired off again to take our respective routes down to the drainage, and once again ended up there at about the same time. Daryn met us there too, having just come down from the summit of Mt Sill, and we all headed down together. The terrain was tiring, but much easier on the downhill. Once we reached the meadow we found the proper use-trail through the area and had an easy time getting back to the main trail, and in no time we were back at the cars.\r\n  &lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n  Sadly this was the last day of the Challenge for me. I had originally planned on attempting to participate for the entire 10 days, but Dirk Summers had tempted me into joining him and Gordon Ye in climbing the 5.6 North Arete of Matterhorn Peak. While it would have been fun to climb the rest of the peaks in this year&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;s Challenge, I was more interested in getting more experience on technical alpine routes. After having my last dinner with Bob and the gang, with the new arrival Heyning Cheng making some &amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#152;interesting&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#153; conversation, Heyning gave me a ride back up to Bishop to meet up with Dirk for my &lt;a href=\"http://www.markpthomas.com/mountaineering/trip-reports/california/north-arete-of-matterhorn-peak\"&gt;next adventure in the Sierra&lt;/a&gt;.\r\n  &lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;div&gt;Note: I came back in 2010 at an attempt to do a traverse of the ridge with Dirk Summers. Lightning chased us off, but I wouldn\'t let go of the idea, and in 2013 I returned with Steph Abegg and did the traverse, FINALLY summitting Gandalf Peak, along with the rest of the Palisade Crest summits.
