Check out Oltons shoulder at Mount Rushmore the formation gets its name from the 1936 Original Route in which Fritz stood on Percy Olton\'s shoulders as a point of aid to gain the starting crack. Another story is on what was thought to be the first ascent of inner outlet. Fritz was climbing and noticed a ladder made from logs on the way up. Disgusted he knocked it off thinking he was bagging the first ascent.  Herb and Jan Conn some of america\'s first dirt bag climbers were passing through to Devils Tower and the Tetons. They were impressed with the natural beauty of the Hills. They liked the easy access and many unclimbed summits. They ended up settling in the Hills and mapping and recording the Black Hills climbing.Through the 1940s-1950s they established 219 first ascents in very bold style. This included a 60ft rope, tennis shoes, pitons,carabiners and bowline on a bight for a (harness). The Conn Diagonal is worth checking out as well as East Gruesome both should be on the top climbs list of the midwest. Remember the Conns always down climbed everything and never rappelled. It was good practice for the times when you get in over your head and needed to downclimb.    The Needles in the southern hills is host to runout face climbing on impressively skinny spires, the largest of which can be 3-4 pitches long.  Mt Rushmore is home to hundreds of well protected sport routes, and perhaps has the best concentration of memorable, high quality 5.6-5.9 sport routes on earth.  Old Baldy near Mt Rushmore is the premier bouldering area in the hills - spectacular enough to inspire Kurt Smith\'s film: Friction Addiction: Black Hills Gold.

People come from around the world to climb on this unique wonder.  Climbing is sustained, and cracks are beautiful and uniformly shaped.  Essentially, there is a crack every 5 or 10 feet, and they mostly run perfectly up and down, which reduces rope drag.  The majority of the tower is less than vertical, and faces are blank.  There are few face climbs, but who needs them with all these splitter cracks?  The easiest route to the summit is Durrance, which is stout 5.6.  In general, climbs that are 5.8 and under tend to be offwidths, 5.9 are hand cracks, and 5.10 are finger cracks.  There is too many classics to list.  However, check out Assembly Line, Walt Bailey, and Soler for 5.9.  For 5.10, go to One-Way Sunset, Hollywood &amp; Vine, and Tulgey Wood.    Many routes are best done by climbing the first few pitches and then rappeling.  Fixed anchors are numerous.  The rock quality is poor for the last 100 feet of the tower or so.  Most parties who summit do so through the Meadows area.  This is the ledgy area that is a small distance below the summit on South face of the tower.  Climbs such as Durrance, Wiessner, Bon Homme, Walt Bailey, and Soler use this.  From the meadows, follow a 4th class chimney and ramp system to the summit (some parties rope up).  To descend from the summit, a rap anchor is on the south side.  two ropes are required.  The summit part can either be rappeled or downclimbed to the meadows (easy, but exposed).  Then, 3 two rope rappels are required to get down to the ground.  Be careful when rappeling from the meadows -- it is very easy to get your rope hopelessly stuck in the cracks, so rap over the face.','Drive to Sundance, Wyoming, and then take highway 24 north from I-90.  Just follow the signs, and drive towards the big chunk or stone.  Turn into the monument and pay the entrance fee.  Then continue to the visitor\'s center.

It is generally quite dry here; however, wandering along the River Road after a large rainfall can provide spectacular waterfall viewing.  Here, you can find climbs ranging from 1 pitch sport climbs up to 600\' desert spires to multi-day adventures on the 900\' The Titan to 1200\' ridge/aid climbs like Everyman\'s Endless Edge.  Desert spires can be hauntingly beautiful like Moses, Zeus, and Aphrodite in Taylor Canyon.  Of course, there is the world-class desert crack climbing of Indian Creek.

You will find an wide range of subtle variations in rock type: the splitter-crack-forming Windgate, the ultra-soft Entrada, the gorgeous Navajo, the oddly solid-yet crumbly Cutler, the interesting mid-layers of Chinle, Kayenta, and more.  You must be cautious treading on desert rock for longer-than-you-think after any significant precipitation.  Most folks will find the Windgate to be most inviting here.

Weather can vary from extremes of debilitating heat to mud-trapping rain storms to frosty climes.  Pay particular attention to quick-moving lightning storms, since these are probably a climber\'s biggest threat here.

There are also many challenging lines that will test the seasoned wall rat.  There are plenty of short, one or two pitch routes for those who don\'t want to venture too high off the deck.  As a National Park, Zion charges $25 for a seven-day pass or $80 for an annual pass (good at all National Parks and covers entry fees at most other federally-managed lands).  A $10 fee is charged for a bivy permit for each wall you do.  Overnight bivy permits are obtained from the rangers at the visitors center.  Or you can book online using the Zion online permits. You still have to pick them up but at least it is booked.  Beginning sometime in March all cars have to be parked at the Visitors Center.  Shuttle buses have to be ridden to access anything in the canyon during the high season.  They are fairly efficient and operate from 5:45am until 11:00pm.  There is camping at the Watchman Campground inside the park, as well as lodging at the Zion Lodge (not for the standard, dirt-bag wall rat).  Free camping is available in many areas just outside of the park in the Springdale and Rockville area.  Some of these sites have been really trashed.  Feel free to clean them up so that free camping continues.  Springdale is loaded with all of the necessary amenities for a long stay.

A few considerations and logistics while you\'re here:      Entrance fee (currently $20) is valid for 7 days of purchase. Camping in the Park is $10/campsite/night, and is on a first-come, first-served basis (no reservations).  However, reservations may be made online for group campsites at Indian Cove, Sheep Pass, Cottonwood, and Black Rock Campgrounds through the NPS Reservation Center.  More about camping....     Weekends are crowded during peak season! With its proximity to Los Angeles and San Diego, the Park draws more than 1 million visitors annually. Plan accordingly and have a backup plan if the campgrounds are full.  There are numerous inexpensive motels in the nearby towns of Joshua Tree, Yucca Valley, and 29 Palms.    There are no gas stations in the Park itself. There are two gas stations in the town of Joshua Tree - a Valero on the corner of Park and Hwy 62 and at a Circle K (no diesel) which is a block to the east. Yucca Valley, 6 miles west of town on Hwy 62, has many gas stations to choose from with most having lower prices than the ones in Joshua Tree.      There is no running water in the Park. Come prepared with a 5-gallon or more jug if planning on staying more than a day. The last place to fill up is at the West Entrance kiosk, where you\'ll pay 25 cents for 5 gallons.       Protect your food!!! Coyotes, squirrels, and scrub jays WILL raid your food if left out. A couple of durable plastic storage bins will make your life a lot easier and will help to keep the critters self-sufficient.

Both cracks and face climbs coexist here, and there are some kick-ass climbs of both sorts. The Donner Pass climbing season is from mid April until whenever snow closes the road in November or December.  Donner\'s 7000\' elevation means that even during beautiful summer days a surprise storm is possible, so be prepared.  Lodging  Camping near the climbing is illegal, but doesn\'t seem to be too severely enforced. If that troubles you, seasonally there\'s camping on the opposite side of Donner Lake (see Donner Memorial State Park\'s website for details), and both cabins and hotels accommodations in from there to Truckee, which is an ample source of nearby food and entertainment.  Granite Flat Campground opens earlier each year than Donner Memorial SP. It is located a few miles south of Truckee on highway 89. It currently costs $22/night for a single vehicle site. It\'s not the most remote campsite as it is directly adjacent to 89, but has decent toilets and well water.  Access  In 2014, the Truckee Donner Land Trust and the Access Fund jointly launched the  Save Donner Climbing campaign. The following year, it purchased formerly private land for public conservation and access, which includes the Black Wall and other nearby cliffs.

Its close proximity to the South Bay and moderate weather during the Winter months make it very popular with the Bay Area climbing community, but at the same time the area is known for its \"less than granite quality\" rock. Some despise its chossy character, others revel in its history of adventure and \"ground up\" ethic.  As a former haunt of some of Yosemite\'s children of the Golden Age of climbing, the names of Roper, Bridwell, Bates are associated with this area. It has bolt-protected face climbs due to the lack of good cracks, as well as more traditional climbs.   An Intro to the Pinnacles by Steven Dalleske  Tap tap tap, tap tap tap, I can always tell when an experienced Pinnacles climber is in the area. The fact is you can usually hear them long before you see them. Tapping the holds with our knuckles is just one of the unique techniques we have learned to rely on over the years of scrambling across this unique rock. For me, the farther I am from my last protection the more I\'m tapping and if I\'m really wigging out you\'ll see me start kicking at the foot holds too. What I\'m doing is listening for a nice sharp report from the knob or cobble in question. Something that will let me know how well it\'s attached to the cliff and how much I want to rely on it. A dull or hollow sound above a fall you\'re not interested in taking and you should be looking for alternatives. If there are no viable alternatives, its time to decide how bad you want the route and if you decide to push on you\'ll, at the least, have a better understanding what your getting into. Keep in mind, though, that if you seriously tried to avoid all the loose rock at the Pinns, you\'re route selection would be seriously limited if not non-existent. Climbing the Pinnacles rock is an art, it\'s something that takes an acquired taste to really appreciate, but once mastered it\'s an art that will give you new confidence when visiting other more sound climbing areas.   Another good habit to adopt when negotiating the minefields that are the Pinnacles rock is to try to avoid stepping on the knobs. This is because, when a weighted knob pops, under your foot you\'ll be at the end of your rope or bouncing off a ledge before you know it. Consequently, a seasoned Pinn-head will, given the opportunity, consciously avoid using the knobs for footholds and instead seek features in the matrix to find a purchase for the foot. The matrix being like a gritty mortar that holds the cobbles in place tends to crumble rather than pop as the knobs do and this can, in some cases, give you the extra second needed to make a decision and hopefully an escape. Eventually you\'ll find yourself spreading your weight out on the rock, moving like a cat, taking full advantage of stances, exploring and carefully planning your sequences, appreciating a sound bolt more than ever before, clipping anchors with a relief that overwhelms and if you can learn love this careful style of climbing, you\'ve become a true Pinn-head.   Because of the unique rock here, soloing and bouldering at the Pinns, though not unheard of, is considered foolhardy, if not suicidal. Ironically, most of the moderate routes here have serious run outs on them which, coupled with our not so lovable rock makes even the easiest route a serious endeavor. You must always be conscious of your potential falls, this is not a place to haphazardly romp around 20\' out from the last bolt. Since the knobs pop on all routes equally, you are more likely to get hurt on something easy like the Portent, 5.6 with it\'s 20\' to 30\' run outs than something a little harder like Cantaloupe Death, 5.10c which has mere 6\' to 8\' run outs. In most cases the easier routes were put up 30, 40 or even 50 years ago in a bygone time when climbing was a more dangerous animal, commitment was at a premium and protection was sub standard by modern ideals. Consequently if you are not already familiar with the rock here, I don\'t consider the Pinnacles a great place to teach yourself leading. Over the last decade the bolts on most of the more popular routes have been brought up to modern standards, but the run outs, long and true, are and always will remain.','Depending on whether one is going to the more popular East District or the West District will dictate how to get there.   For the East District, go South on 101 to Hwy 25 to Hollister. Go South out of Hollister for several miles until you reach the turn off for Pinnacles National Park.  Go past the campground and entrance station (fee) and continue to where you can go left over the bridge instead of to the Chalone Picnic area.

Climbing is quite varied, from short bouldering, sport, and multipitch traditional lines. Most of these are topropeable short lines, physical for their grades.  Most of the granite in the area has been washed by water over many many years, and now is quite smooth. We\'re not talking Yosemite glass, so friction routes are still doable.  Boasting several hundred existing routes on many different rocks, there are many many days of climbing for people of all abilities. This is an excellent place to set your first pro, and also a great place for the development of new routes.  There are no access fees for climbing in Cosumnes River Gorge. While the climbing areas are on privately owned land, the owner has permitted climbing access. A 1979 trip report by Bob Branscomb in the American Alpine Journal mentioned that the owner requests that no campfires be lit, so be a cool guest and respect this .  Descents are as varied as the climbing.','From Hwy 50, exit on Missouri Flats (Right). Take that a few miles until you find a T-intersection with Pleasant Valley Rd and take that to Bucks Bar.

Once out of the car, head off the right side of the road in the middle of the guard rail.  There is a wide trail that is paved for the first few hundred feet.  The approach is downhill and takes about 10 minutes to the main climbing areas.',38.6524,-120.707,'Highway 50 Corridor','/v/highway-50-corridor/109968910'),(104,105733959,'/v/lovers-leap/105733959','Lover\'s Leap Rock Climbing','This area is an excellent 250 to nearly 600 foot tall chunk of mostly vertical granite, containing hundreds of cracks crisscrossed with thousands of horizontal dikes. These dikes are key to reducing what would otherwise be very steep and difficult traditional routes, into routes with good rests and abundant holds, resulting in an area with relatively moderate grades. You will find over 250 developed routes that range from low bouldering traverses to 4 pitches tall. Some routes are bolt protected, but most of the sport climbing is 5.10+ YDS or harder, as the abundance of traditionally protected routes in close proximity to each other discourages squeezing in a bunch of moderate sport face climbing. All of the routes demand less than 20 minutes to \"hike\" into, as the entrance path is part of the pioneer trail, and therefore excellently maintained and quite wide.   Lovers Leap can sometimes seem crowded in certain areas, especially in the summer on weekends. However there is an almost limitless number of adventure routes and hidden classics that rarely ever see any traffic. As long as you\'re willing to step outside the box and try something that is not a \"trade route\", you will never have to wait in line or climb anywhere near other climbers... ever! Lovers Leap has a higher concentration and number of routes in close proximity to each other than any other crag in California. Add to that it\'s wide range of difficulty in routes and there is more than enough to keep everyone busy for a long time.   The main formation is traditionally divided into these walls, from right/west/closest to the campground, to left/east/furthest:West Wall, Main Wall, Central Wall, and East Wall. The second largest formation is the Hogsback. Many other small developed walls abound, mostly not yet covered on this site (seven or more of these are covered in Carville\'s Tahoe climbing guide). The nearest and most popular of these are the Lower Buttress and Dear John Buttress. The Loaf Boulder and Monks Rock are major boulders right outside the campground; other potential abounds in less convenient and obvious pieces of granite.  Camping and Amenities  There is a developed campground (first come, first served) at the western foot of the cliff. To find the campground, pull into the Strawberry Lodge parking lot. Follow the road to the left of the lodge past several cabins until you cross a small bridge over the river. After the bridge take an immediate left up a single lane road. Follow this road until it ends at the campground.   Camping is $10 (U.S.) a night and $5 (U.S.) for an extra car per day. There is limited day parking ($5) in the campground for climbers. Overflow parking is found along the road 100 yards past the bridge/river on the right side of the road. Do not park alongside the road leading to the campground or in the Strawberry Lodge parking lot. Your car may be towed at your expense, (up to $1000 dollars in fines and/or a 30 day impound can be applied).     Conveniently located at the edge of the campground are a few large boulders worth doing. From the parking lot, head uphill and cross over the small foot bridge to the Pony Express Trail. Hang a left, and walk up the gently sloped trail for about 3 minutes.   Almost all multipitch routes are best to walk off, both for the preservation of existing vegetation, and that most routes don\'t have any fixed protection at the top of the rock due to the abundance of trees, cracks, and large rocks at the top.  You can get pretty good food at the Strawberry Lodge, breakfast, lunch and dinner. They serve food at the bar as well and is a bit cheaper too. The Lodge is very climber friendly and showers can be purchased for a small fee. Just ask at the front desk.   Across the street is the Strawberry Station, where you can pick up drinks and basic goods. There is also a small but usually well stocked gear store which carries all your basic (and then some) climbing gear. They also rent shoes and probably other gear if you just happen to forget something. It is owned and operated by a great and friendly local family the head of which is Squirrel, a local climber with all the beta you\'ll ever need.

It is considered an excellent winter crag because of its lower elevation and mostly south-southwest facing position. There\'s both sport and trad, with single and multi-pitch routes of grades both easy to moderate, as well as full on hard committing routes that will test the strongest and boldest of climbers. The spire is about 350 feet tall and you can walk off the uphill side without much difficulty.   Peripheral Rocks  The Sugarloaf area also includes a handful of smaller rocks that you can find along the trail leading up to Sugarloaf proper. These rocks hold a slew of low to moderate quality routes with a few classics thrown in. Routes on these rocks can range from easy 5th class to extremely difficult and vary in height between 40 and 100 feet tall.  Land Ownership  The climbing area, and the Pony Express Trail that passes below it, are both in Eldorado National Forest. You can always check the ENF Website for recent information.

There are several pullouts just a few miles up the road that allow for overnight camping. However, the gate closes for the winter, so if it\'s snowy and icy, chances are the gate will be closed.   2) Drive down HWY 50 (West)and make a right onto 31 Milestone tract. There is a large pullout that allows camping. This road also closes in the winter months but tends to stay open longer than Silverfork Rd.   3) There is year round opportunity along Ice House Rd.

Keep following the dead end signs up to Thousand Oaks Circle.  Park here.  At the end of this circle, a really steep dirt trail heads up the hill.  Take the first left off of this (not very pronounced, only a short distance from the road), which goes up to a dirt road.  Go left on this dirt road, almost immediately encountering a black gate with a security camera in view.  Skirt around this fence on the uphill side using the obvious trail.  Drop back down to the road once past the fence.  Follow this road for quite a ways, eventually finding a cairn which makes an exit trail.  Follow this a small ways to another good cairn in a drainage.  This drainage is the key to finding the route.  Just follow the drainage, which trends right (south), and eventually starts climbing up to the slabs.  The last long strectch which approaches the slabs is often filled with snow.  An ice axe is very useful, and some people even use crampons (probably not necessary).

Since then, I have seen it grow immensely in popularity and is headed the way of Eldo (i.e. crowded as hell); however, this growth is mainly from the weekend warriors, on the weekday climbing is more reasonable.  Lumpy is awesome, the climbs are moderately long, two to five pitches on average, and take place in a spectacular setting with views of Longs and RMNP.  The climbs are spread out on a number of unique formations, the most popular being The Book.  Sundance, far at the end of the ridge, is the tallest cliff at 700-800\' and has awesome classic climbing with a long approach that deters the lazier climbers.   The climbing at Lumpy is interesting.  I have always felt it to be quite stiff.  Pushing the grades here in the 5.10 and 5.11 range often requires fiddling with tricky pro on less than vertical flared cracks while fighting a heinous calf pump.  The pitches tend to be full length and take place on highly technical granite that requires solid footwork. There aren\'t too many beginner climbs here, Lumpy climbing is concentrated in the 5.9-5.11 range.  That said there are a few classic outings in the 5.5-5.8 range.  These include:  Magical Chrome Plated Semi-Automatic Enema Syringe (5.7, this is a good, although not classic climb), Batman and Robin (5.6, great beginner climb or first lead), White Whale and Hiatus (5.7, totally classic), Kor\'s Flake (5.8, longer route), Osiris (5.8, you will either love or hate this \"wider\" climb), Melvin\'s Wheel (.8+, great climb), Pear Buttress (.8+, best 5.8 on the Ridge), Cackle Crack (5.8, short).  Climbing in the 5.9-5.10 range opens up tons of classics, these are a very few. J-Crack (.9, spicy with a runout 5.8 traverse, time tested classic), Loose Ends (.9 awesome), George\'s Tree (.9, very typical Lumpy climbing), Mainliner (.9-, DO THIS CLIMB), Orange Julius (.10a, varied climbing), Climb of the Ancient Mariner (.10a classic face), Fat City (.10+ famous classic, a sandbag), Cheap Date (.10a) and Outlander (.10+), great finish to routes like Pear Buttress  and J-Crack ), Gollum\'s Arch (.10a, sandbagged and sustained with many different sizes on it).  In the 5.11 range, almost every route is good, yet many are tricky to protect as they are thin seams and faint features. Stretch Marks (.11a, a little scary), Living Dead (.11b, very finicky protection), Backbone Arete (.11c, a well bolted yet very hard slab), Finger Lickin\' Good (.11a), Corner Pump Station (.11c).  I haven\'t done these two, yet they, obviously belong on this list.  For those with minimal time to spare, Little Twin Owls has good toproping with a classic Finger Crack (.11) that should not be missed.  There is good bouldering just before Little Twin Owls, and just after the turnoff for The Book.  Two good routes for the solid .10 trad leader are on Checkerboard Rock, a fifteen minute approach.  These climbs are Ziggy\'s Day Out (.10+) and Checkerboard Crack (.10b), both these routes are short and require a lot of skill at placing pro.  Checkerboard Crack is classic Lumpy climbing, flared, insecure, sustained, and very hard to protect.','Take US 36 to Estes, head across the lake and go straight at the first stoplight you meet.  At the second stoplight, head straight, the road curves left here and passes the Stanley Hotel.  Take a right 1/4 mile after the Stanley on Devil\'s Gulch Road.  Head straight on this road for a mile or so (Lumpy Ridge should be quite obvious in front of you) until it begins to curve right. When it curves right, there will be a wooden gate that says McGregor Ranch.  Take the road through the gate for a half mile, to the Lumpy Ridge parking lot.  The new trailhead will be located east of the Twin Owls Trailhead just off MacGregor Ave.  The gravel access road lies just west of the Gem Lake Trailhead.  This will result in an additional 0.7 miles to formations west of Twin Owls.  This will shorten access to crags east of Twin Owls.

It consists of steep, beautiful conglomerate  sandstone walls of up to 700 feet high, in brilliant shades of gold and red. The rock quality is reminiscent of granite rather than the soft sandstone found throughout much of Utah and Arizona.   The largest cliff, Redgarden Wall , is a few thousand feet wide; it boasts several spectacular summits and an incredible collection of classic climbs.  Many of the classic routes were  put up in the 1960s by Layton Kor, along with climbers such as Pat Ament and Larry Dalke.  The 1970s were primarily a time of first free ascents,  spearheaded by climbers such as Steve Wunsch, Roger Briggs, Jim Erickson, and Duncan Ferguson.  New activity tailed off a bit in the 1980s, though some very good routes were established.   Climbing in Eldorado Canyon can be odd and it requires some getting used to. It is primarily a traditional area, yet there is relatively little crack  climbing.  Friends of mine who are used to Lumpy Ridge think everything in Eldo is a sandbag, but once I got used to Eldo I started to feel more secure there than at Lumpy Ridge.  Individual pitches will often require delicate face  climbing and some kind of funky, inobvious traverse.  Highly technical moves separated by decent rests are quite common.  Old fixed gear is an Eldo staple, and can either add or subtract spice from your route depending on its quality and the availability of other pro.  It enables routes such as the The Yellow Spur and the West Buttress of the Bastille (both 5.9) to offer pro-at-your-waist cruxes.  On the other hand, you just know that those pins at the cruxes of climbs like Tagger (5.10) and the The Naked Edge (5.11) are not going to hold too many more 10 foot falls. One should really back up most pins whenever possible.  Ultimately, skill in placing pro is very important;  cracks tend to be discontinuous and incipient, and nearly all the \"sport\" routes require some gear as well.    Must-do beginner routes include Wind Ridge and Calypso (both 5.6) on Wind Tower.  They are both a bit awkward in spots.  In the 5.8 range, Ruper on Redgarden Wall and The Bastille Crack top the list.  The Bulge (5.7+) on Redgarden is quite runout, but also excellent.  Many people feel that The Yellow Spur (5.9) on Redgarden Wall is the best route in the Canyon.  Other great routes at that grade include the West Buttress and Hair City (Bastille), Anthill Direct and The Green Spur (Redgarden Wall), and the The Unsaid (The West Ridge).  5.10 classics are everywhere; my personal favorites are Rosy Crucifixion (10a) and Outer Space (10c).  Over the Hill (10b), Super Slab, Grandmother\'s Challenge, and Tagger (all 10c) are also great, as are many, many other routes at the grade.  5.11 offers some world-renowned classics  like the The Naked Edge, Vertigo (11b), and the Northwest Corner of the Bastille (11a).  5.12 (which I have no experience with personally) seems to offer either very scary climbs such as Scary Canary (12b) or very safe climbs such as Your Mother. (12d).  5.13s are fairly rare, due to bolt restrictions, but some historic classics such as Desdichado and Rainbow Wall do exist.  Addendum: A trad 5.14, Iron Monkey (freeding Lycra-Clad Donkeys), has been established.  The aforementioned Redgarden Wall holds the longest routes, but also offers great one-pitch climbs, [particularly] a little ways up the trail at a long slanting roof.  The Bastille is a 350 foot high vertical cliff which rises right out of the road and offers very steep climbing.  The The Wind Tower is the place to go for great beginner climbs as well as scary 5.10 routes, and the The West Ridge/Rincon offers the best concentration of one pitch routes of all grades -- usually very aesthetic crack and corner climbs.  Obscure outlying areas such as Cadillac Crag, Shirt Tail Peak, and the Peanuts Walls have excellent climbing, but also involve longer approaches.    Eldo can be a very confusing place and it is helpful to at least look at a guidebook, such as Steve Levin\'s newest guidebook, Eldorado Canyon, A Climber\'s Guidebook, or Richard Rossiter\'s out of print, comprehensive Rock Climbing Eldorado Canyon.  Fred Knapp\'s Classic Boulder Climbs is about a third the cost, and still has most of the best routes as well as other great routes around Boulder.    Ideally, a traditional climber\'s road trip to Boulder should include a day at Eldo followed by a day at Lumpy Ridge (45 minutes from Boulder)-- both offer fantastic climbing, but it is hard to imagine two more different styles.  Of course, if experience permits, the alpine rock climbs in nearby Rocky Mountain National Park are not to be missed, either.  One can climb in Eldo at any time of year, though summer is piping hot and slick while winter is inconsistent.','From Denver, head N on I-25 to US 36, go to the CO Hwy 170 exit.

The Bastille and, in particular, its North Face, is a cornerstone of climbing in Eldorado Canyon State Park.  According to P. Ament in High Over Boulder this was once called Chimney Rock and may have been named The Bastille by Stan Shepard in 1957.  This modest, 350 foot crag can be divided into The N face and the W face for organizational purpose.  The N face is steep, shaded, and has exceptional routes for intermediate climbers and advanced climbers who seek out the mental challenges in addition to the physical.  There are those who count the seconds attempting to set solo speed records here.  There is probably little for the lower end difficulty climber nor the high end climber here.  Once, the summit provided an anchor point for the cable upon which crossed Ivy Baldwin on many death-defying crossings of the canyon.  Today, the cable remains testament to a disappearing breed of adventurer.  Climbing here began at least in the 1950s.  There are legends of Frenchmen swilling champagne during an ascent up The Bastille Crack on French Independence Day.  Today, this remains a crag that holds a special place in the hearts of climbers who have progressed to climb some of the great walls and peaks of the world.  Amazingly, this face had some early high standard climbing with Stan Shepard and Allen Bergen freeing the upper 4 pitches of the Bastille Crack in 1957; however, the most amazing feat is likely Ray Northcutt\'s 1959 freeing of the Northcutt Start, 5.10d, after being told, incorrectly, that his competitor, Layton Kor, had just freed it.  This crag has been a proving grounds for some of Colorado\'s finest including: Layton Kor, Steve Komito, Pat Ament, Larry Dalke, Ray Northcutt, Dudley Chelton, Rob Candelaria, Roger Briggs, Kevin Donald, Jeff Lowe, Charlie Fowler, David Breashears, Duncan Ferguson, Christian Griffith, Mic Fairchild, Derek Hersey, among others.

It certainly offers the best non-wide crack climbing (if you like them wide, head for Twin Owls!).  Many long, striking crack and dihedral lines grace the complex cliff, which rises to heights of 600\'.  Due to the cliff\'s predominant less-than-vertical aspect, many of these lines check in at under 5.10, though there are plenty of test-pieces at 5.10 and 5.11 as well.  A few bolt-protected 5.12s are scattered about, and true hardpersons can attempt the 5.13+ crack line of Country Boy, first freed by Tommy Caldwell.  Some recommended routes would include  Pear Buttress at 5.8;  Loose Ends and J-Crack at 5.9; Fat City, Cheap Date, and many others at 5.10, and any of the 5.11 routes such as Howling at the Wind that ascend in or near the Howling dihedral.  The Renaissance Wall and El Camino Real are said to be good 5.12 routes.  The Book also has many 1-pitch routes (including first pitches of longer lines) which are a good alternative if the weather looks iffy for a longer route.  Fixed anchors seem to come and go, however...  DESCENT: From the very top of the cliff, one can walk east a ways, beyond a steep broken area, and then contour back to the base (long and easy).  Many routes end just above the \"Cave\" on the right side of the Book.  From here, scramble out on a narrow ledge east to its end, and downclimb a groove (or do a short rappel from a tree a little ways out).  From the bottom of the groove, go southeast (easier but longer) to walking terrain, or head southwest down more grooves to a cairn at the top of a east-angling chimney/gully.  Go down that and one more chimney to walking terrain.  Like the east slabs descent in Eldorado Canyon, this shorter descent should not be attempted in the dark or when wet unless you are familiar with it.  No rappel route exists that I know of and none is needed.','From the new parking lot, take the west trail towards the old Twin Owls parking lot ~0.6 miles.  The Book is a complex cliff; here is an attempt to describe it.

Just left is the beautiful J-Crack Slab, sporting the very long parallel crack lines of Femp and J-Crack, and several other excellent crack lines to their left.  Above are some reddish overhangs on the right, a cavernous overhang (The Cave!), and to the left, a short, steep headwall capping the cliff. ~45-50 minutes to approach.  The next major landmark is the Howling at the Wind dihedral, a massive, overhanging left-facing corner which extends about halfway up the cliff.  Many superb and intimidating free lines attack this feature and the overhangs nearby.  Left of it are narrow, smooth slabs, with an arching roof band about 150 feet up.  The next section is obvious: an area of deep grooves which extend the entire length of the cliff, known as the Pages Wall.  Left again are two massive chimneys running the entire height of the cliff (Book of the Dead Chimney and Requiem Chimney).  A narrow prow between the two, known as the Isis Buttress, offers many excellent routes.  The western-most chimney includes the brilliant Renaissance Wall, home to numerous hard bolted &amp; naturally protected climbs.

This world-renowned sport climbing mecca has more than once been at the focal point of the climbing world.  Extensive development took place in the 1960s, 70s, and 80s by locals and international climbers alike, who put up scores of classic climbs on the tuff and basalt cliffs; development continues to this day with new moderates and cutting-edge routes going up each year.  Ranging from classic beginner routes to hardcore testpieces on a wide variety of rock, there is truly something here for everyone.  Although best known for its sport climbing traditional climbers can find plenty to be excited about here as well.  Located in the high desert in central Oregon, Smith Rock State ParkÂ’s cliffs and hillsides take a commanding presence over the surrounding terrain.  The main cliffs are made of volcanic welded tuff, and surrounding bands of columnar basalt lie above the winding Crooked River.  Smith Rock is a perfect weekend getaway for residents of the Portland area as well as a worthy destination for anybody exploring the WestÂ’s climbing.  The prominent walls overlooking the Crooked River are home to many of Smith RockÂ’s most famous routes, but for those seeking some solitude and adventure there is plenty to be found on the back side or among the basalt columns in the Upper and Lower gorge.  Monkey Face, perhaps the parkÂ’s most recognizable feature, sits proudly on the back side of Smith Rock with spectacular views of the Cascade Mountains and the arid landscape below.  It takes years to become familiar with all of the areas at Smith, and there is enough climbing here to allow even the locals to find new favorites every season.  There are over 1,500 routes at Smith but it\'s easy to get stuck in a cycle where you only climb the same 50 classics each season; a little exploring here to the less-traveled areas goes a long way.  Approaches are generally short and straightforward from the main parking lot, and a well-maintained system of trails provides easy access to all of the parkÂ’s areas.  Please donÂ’t stray from the established trails; the visual and environmental impact of people scrambling up the hillsides can be enormous.  There is water available at the parking lot and a drinking fountain at the bridge, although they both get turned off during the cold months.  I\'ve heard that the water from the sinks in the bathrooms isn\'t potable so bring your own to be on the safe side if the fountains are shut off.  Restrooms are available in the main parking lot, at the bridge, and the Phoenix Composting Toilet is conveniently located within sprinting distance of the popular walls on the front side of the park.  Please respect those around you, keep your pets under control, and pack out everything that you bring in.

Most climbs are about 1000 feet tall on the east face that gets shady by afternoon.  Storms can brew over on the west side and give you quite a surprise.  There are two non-technical ways to the summit: the Whitney trail, a long slog up an easy walking trail, and the Mountaineers Route, a steep gully filled with loose rock, which is the usual descent route for climbers.  There\'s a decent campground at the end of the road, near the trailhead.  You must have a permit to camp anywhere beyond that, and they\'re not easy to get.  Call 760-873-2483 or go to the forest service\'s website.

Incredible views of the mountain (and most routes), clear water right in front of you, and the climbing starts just a little ways up the scree slope from your campsite.  Getting there is tough and it\'s quite easy to get off route.  I recommend buying the supertopo and follow the excellent instructions there.  The hike can get really hot.  Start early (dawn) and you\'ll get to a campsite by lunch, have time to rest up and scope the route.

The trail will pass rightwards beneath a large slab as it heads to a creek crossing to once again get to the north side and very soon afterwards the Ebersbacher Ledges, which follow a ramp eastwards, over an exposed step then back west to a treed terrace, from there the trail stays north of the creek up to Lower Boy Scout Lake. Cross the outlet and follow switchbacks up a large scree field through some very large boulders, and brush up to the sweeping slabs coming down from Upper Boy Scout Lake, which you don\'t need to reach because above the slabs there\'s a rough slope which leads you into the valley below the needles Day and Keeler (one of the most spectacular spots in the Lower 48).

Deep forested valleys, pristine lakes, beautiful meadows, acres of suncups, huge walls and domes, jagged ridges leading up to windswept nameless summits; all these await you.  Some of the finest granite, most beautiful mountains, and stable weather make the High Sierra a special place for climbers.  Though there are some long monolithic faces (like Charlotte Dome), the majority of climbing is on high altitude mountain walls which follow crack systems.  Frequent ledges make for comfy belays.  Routes frequently wander a bit, but pro is usually not a problem, and long slings can often be used to tie off a feature and keep the drag down. Of course like all mountain big walls, there are loose blocks, boulders, and rocks on the ledges, so take care with the ropes.  Despite the crowds in a few places, the dreaded permit system means the climbs are uncrowded, the camping is pleasant, and you feel like you\'ve gotten away from it all and found some true wilderness.  In fact some parts of this range are incredibly far from the madding crowd, seek these places out, they are ancient and sacred places. For every crowded classic (a result of the \"select\" books?) there are a hundred empty just as classic routes.

May and June provide long daylight hours. Weather can be unstable with late arriving winter storms. Cold to cool.  July-Early Aug: Not so much snow, unless it\'s a big snow year. Suncups begin to develop which can hamper approaches. Still lots of daylight. Stable weather. Mosquitos. Warm.  Mid August - Mid September. No snow, more scree. Late afternoon thunderstorms.

Interesting reading from the Ranger Reports.','The High Sierra runs from the Sawtooth Range in the north, south to the Whitney Group, and covers an area bigger than the entire European Alps - most of it wilderness.    The easiest access is from Highway 395 on the east side, where several roads (thanks FDR) terminate at 7,000-10,000 foot trailheads within a few miles of the peaks, there are also options to cross high passes to access west country.  There are also approaches from the west side, they are very beautiful and they tend to be longer and less steep, these are more useful for peaks or crags on the west side.  From the bay area, Highway 120 through Yosemite is the fastest route, even if you\'re going all the way to Whitney.  If you leave after work, you can stop in Tuolumne Meadows (8,800 ft) or one of the Forest Service campgrounds just beyond the park (from 7,000-9,000 feet, and a bit cheaper).  All these campgrounds will be full on summer weekends starting in July, but you can reserve sites in Tuolumne Meadows.  From Los Angeles take Highway 14 to 395 for the east side approaches. For the west side approaches take Freeway 5 then Highway 99.  If you\'re from out of town, you might find a good deal flying to Reno and renting a car.

The majority of rock around Santa Barbara, Ventura, and Ojai is medium-grade sandstone (i.e., a little friable), but there\'s also blue schist (Green Dome), andesite (SLO), and conglomerate (Silly Rock, Wheeler Gorge) out there.  The climbing is by no means world class, but what it lacks in quality it makes up for in aesthetics.  As a friend of mine would say, \"maybe not 4-star climbing, but makes for a 4-star day!\"  Areas like the Sespe Gorge (Black Wall) had established routes as early as the late 50s and 60s.  Over the years, many well-known climbers have graced these small cliffsides, including the likes of Yvon Chouinard (Yosemite legend and founder/owner of Patagonia), Jonny Woodward (Black Diamond), Jim Donini and even Henry Barber!  Around Santa Barbara and Ventura, pioneers of the \'80s and \'90s included Kevin Brown, Kevin Steele, Steve Tucker, Menzo Baird, Bob Banks (author of \"Ocean\'s Eleven\") and Steve Edwards (guidebook author of \"Rock Climbing Santa Barbara &amp; Ventura\"), who established many of the newer sport routes around Santa Barbara and Hwy 166/Silly Rock.

It would be hard to find another location in the country where such an extensive variety, from scrambling to hard \"Head Point\" routes exist so close to a major metro area. They form the backdrop to Boulder and are the centerpiece of Boulder\'s Open Space system.  There are three main areas:  Flatirons North This area includes classic rocks such as the First and Third Flatirons, and the Amphitheatre in Gregory Canyon. Climbs here range from short newer-age sport climbs to long trad routes, including some of the longer trad routes in the area, the whole face of the 3rd Flatiron, which is about 1300 feet and the Direct East Face of the 1st which is about 1400 feet. Hard conglomerate Fountain Formation sandstone is the medium for your rock craft.  Flatirons Central There are many rocks to explore in this area. The \"Central\" zone spans Bear Canyon to the Ironing Boards (just South of the 3rd Flatiron). Slabmongers can have many field days exploring the numerous smaller Flatirons, and there\'s a good amount of trad and even sport among these rocks. Have fun in this scenic setting.  Flatirons South This section of the Flatirons holds some of the best climbing in the Flatirons, but it seems to be less crowded. Great rocks such as the Maiden, Matron, Devil\'s Thumb, East Ridge, Nebel Horn, Seal Rock, and The Goose offer slabs for beginner trad leaders and also more challenging trad lines. Excellent sport routes also can be found, some several pitches in length. The longest climb in the area is here.  There is plenty to explore here.  Access: Various of the Flatirons are closed for falcon nesting from Feb. 1 up to July 31 and for bat nesting Apr. 1 to Aug. 31.

Located near New Paltz, NY, the Gunks is about 85 miles from the NYC metropolitan area, making it a popular weekend destination.  The rock is quartz conglomerate, solid rock with horizontal rather than vertical cracks. Climbing at the Gunks is characterized by roofs, jugs, traverses, big air, and sometimes \"sporty\" pro.  The Gunks is famous for great one-to-three-pitch climbs of all levels of difficulty.  You\'ll find some of the best easy and moderate trad climbs in the country at the Gunks.  There are a few bolted climbs at the Gunks, but no sport climbs.    The ratings at the Gunks are stiff; beware of a climb with a \"+\" at the end of its rating.  Climbs like Thin Slabs / Thin Slabs Direct (5.7+), Something Interesting (5.7+), Modern Times (5.8+), Broken Sling (5.8+), Le Teton (5.9+), and Coexistence (5.10+) will seem like sandbags to many climbers.  Climbing overhanging rock, even with jugs, requires endurance and commitment.  Most climbers new to the Gunks drop down a few grades in their first leads to get a feel for the rock, the ratings, and to learn how to place pro in the horizontal cracks.  The best time to climb at the Gunks is during the fall: September and October are the prime climbing season.  Mid-October brings the fall colors to the area, and climbers will have to vie with \"leaf peepers\" for restaurants and places to stay in New Paltz.  Climbing in the spring is also popular, but tends to be wetter and more buggy.  Summer is hot and humid (don\'t miss the swimming hole), and winter offers a few climbable days. New Paltz weather forecast  The Gunks is one of the oldest climbing areas in the country.  Fritz Wiessner first climbed at the Gunks in 1935, and he and Hans Kraus put up many classic routes in the 1940s.  High Exposure, established in 1941, remains one of the most exposed and exciting 5.6 routes any climber will ever do, and should be on every visiting climber\'s tick list.  Most of the Gunks is part of the Mohonk Preserve, a land trust dedicated to preserving and protecting the northern Shawangunk Ridge.  Climbers must pay a $17 daily fee to climb at the Gunks, or else buy an annual pass for $90 (amounts as of 2011).  Stop at the Visitor\'s Center, on Rt. 44/55 just below the cliffs, for more information.','By Plane  The out-of-state climber may want to fly into Newark Liberty International Airport (EWR), La Guardia Airport (LGA), or Stewart International Airport (SWF), rent a car, and drive to New Paltz.

Climbing is year round in some places, though most areas are covered in snow from the first snow (usually in October or November) until March - June depending on altitude and direction of the rock.  Access is at most of the region\'s crags, especially in the public lands of the Tahoe and Eldorado National Forests. The Desolation and Granite Chief Wilderness areas have regulations you should learn about before visiting, but for day use, you can self-register for free at the major trail heads leading into them.

By Air South Lake Tahoe and Truckee both have municipal airports if you have the resources.  For the rest of us, the nearest city with commercial flights is Reno.

Amtrak still runs a train over the Sierra in this area, which runs through Truckee once a day or so. It\'s not cheap or fast compared to other modern travel to the Tahoe area, but is scenic (though it only goes by Donner Lake north and out of sight of Lake Tahoe).

Several other areas exist, e.g. bouldering in Central Park, the Timp in Harriman Park, as well as many places of questionable access and/or worth.  The main rock climbing venues are near the eastern side of the state, so folks out in Rochester, Buffalo, etc. have a tough time of it - they\'re either traveling a long ways, pumping plastic, sneaking into the Niagara gorge, or driving across the border to climb in Canada.  Ice climbing is a bit more evenly spread out. The Adirondacks holds the most reliable and extensive ice, but the Catskills generally forms a lot of good ice as well, and the Finger Lakes Region boasts a few lesser-known classic lines (many of which, alas, are not legal to ascend).  Alpine climbing is limited to the Adirondacks, though a few Catskill peaks come close. None of the mountains are particularly tall - Mt. Marcy, at 5,344\' is the highest - but the weather is capricious and runs the extremes. Winter ascents of the High Peaks can be very serious endeavors, especially when climbing a classic line such as the Trap Dike or Gothics North Face.  Although a small state compared to the big West, travel in NY, especially to its mountainous regions, can be tricky. Public transport is decent within two hours of NYC along the major transport corridors, but off these or farther away, and car rental, good maps, and good luck are required.  The great majority of visitors arrive in New York City; for those who do, the Gunks is a 2 hour bus ride to reach, and is definitely the place to go for rock climbing. The Catskills is a bit farther north, and having a car is almost mandatory, particularly during ice season. The Adirondacks is 4 to 5 hours away, and also requires a car.

This modest, 350 foot crag can be divided into The N face and the W face for organizational purpose.  The N face is steep, shaded, and has exceptional routes for intermediate climbers and advanced climbers who seek out the mental challenges in addition to the physical.  There are those who counts the seconds attempting to set solo speed records here.  There is probably little for the lower end difficulty climber nor the high end climber here.

Today, this remains a crag that holds a special place in the hearts of climbers who have progressed to climb some of the great walls and peaks of the world.  Our climbing history shows the first recorded ascent within the canyon when two Army climbers ascended the Bastille Crack in 1954 according to P. Ament in High Over Boulder &amp; R.

It hosts the greatest number of routes, the finest lines, the tallest routes, and it is the largest cliff in the park.  Without Redgarden Wall, Eldorado Canyon might just be another climbing area.  Unless you are truly only seeking the true high-end of climbing difficulty, there is probably ample quantities for you here at this cliff alone.  In fact, some people have moved here simply because Eldorado Canyon and Redgarden Wall are here.  Probably, every American climber who is anyone special has touched this stone.  There is truly something special about this place.  The native Americans knew this.  This was recognized by the earliest modern visitors; however, it was probably not until the 1950s that climbers became bold enough to venture onto its steeper faces.  The climbing here is characterized by excellent sandstone with interspersed short areas of lower quality rock.  The dominant style of climbing is traditional, face climbing, sprinkled occasional cracks, dihedrals, and roofs with various era fixed protection.  Strong protection skills, route-finding skills, and verve are essential on this crag.  A solid, mental control is often required for success and good health here.  Repeated, uncontrolled falls commonly used at modern sport climbing areas are not advisable in many places.  For the purposes of this organization, the division of the crag is arbitrary but involves looking at the cliff in terms of obvious distinct features without splitting it into too many sections (goal of 40ish routes or less per section).  This approach can best be appreciated by stepping back and looking at the crag with fresh eyes and looking for obvious divisions.  Please understand that no one system will be perfect nor necessarily one better than others.  However, the lines used here to split the crag are the 1) the great dihedral right of the Naked Edge (Redguard &amp; right - S Buttress); 2) the roof like area at the bottom of Redgarden Wall and the routes that go through it (Roof Routes); 3) the Lower Ramp and routes below it (Below Lower Ramp); 4) the obvious saddle between Tower One &amp; Tower Two and the well-known route that splits it (Ruper); 5) the obvious large dihedral that splits Lumpe Tower and Tower One (Dirty Deed and the best continuation below it - West Chimney). Obviously, there are going to be challenging lines at the edges of these arbitrary boundaries and those that cross through multiple sections such as Rosy Toit, Roving for Love, Ruper to Grand Giraffe etc.  The likes of Bird, D. Johnson, Shepard, Kor, Dalke, Ament, Culp, Erickson, Wunsch, Ferguson, Bragg, Coyne, Breashears, Webster, Briggs, Hill, Griffith, Hersey, and so many more have wandered here....

It would be wise to plan your descent before you leave the ground since none are completely obvious.    Some lines here can be rappeled.  Others may funnel rappelers down lines like the rappel below The Naked Edge first pitch.  Many of the lines that go to the top can be descended with at least 2 methods.  1) You can downscramble the East Slabs Descent (plan - to be fleshed out with its own separate description)  low 4th class- note this is exposed, lengthy, and particularly slippery when wet.  Also, the last bit can be challenging in the spring with a wet slab finish or funky downclimb down a chimney.  2) You can rappel the Swanson Arete or Dirty Deed rappels.  3) You can go to rappel the Chockstone Chimney rappels which take you to the top of the Upper Ramp or Meadows.  Here, you can rappel the Vertigo rappels (60m or 2 ropes) or carefully descend the Upper Meadows to the rappels below The Naked Edge. 4) You can ascend to the top and far left end of Redgarden Wall and down scramble the gully at the top.

This section of Redgarden Wall includes routes from the top or left-most sections of Redgarden Wall to include Lumpe Tower.  To define the irregular Lumpe tower, we exclude terrain on Tower One, which we arbitrarily demarcate by a line connecting the obvious large dihedral separating upper Tower One &amp; Lumpe Tower, aka The Dirty Deed, and connect this to the ground with obvious, West Chimney.  While this section may not be as packed with history as some of the other sections of Redgarden Wall, there is still interesting tidbits here like Larry Dalke just deciding to free The Green Spur in 1964  on a whim in Climb!.  There is also a fun video clip of the talented, Beth Bennett climbing Silver Raven in Front Range Freaks.  Some of the classics include: the fun Swanson Arete, 5.5; the beautiful Rewritten, 5.7; the zesty The Great Zot to The Zot Face, 5.8+; the fine Green Slab Direct, 5.9; challenging The Green Spur, 5.9; the desert-like Darkness \'til Dawn, 5.9+; the classic Grandmother\'s Challenge, 5.10c; the tricky Disappearing Act, 5.11a; the beautiful Silver Raven, 5.11d; the necky &amp; controversial Paris Girl, 5.13a.  One thing to consider here is that some of these lines do not go into the sun until about 11am or 12pm.  There are few rappel routes in the area.  You can descend Lumpe Tower with rappels along the Swanson Arete and right area with a traverse, 3 double rope rappels to the ground.  You can also risk the rope-catching Dirty Deed rappel.  When in doubt, you can always traverse left at the top of the walls here to a 3rd class-4th class descent beyond the Hot Spur.','To access this section of Redgarden Wall, you should park at the east end of Eldorado Canyon SP, hike uphill briefly, cross the bridge. Here, for routes from Ruper to Super Slab/Doub-Griffith you may choose one of 2 approaches depending on your preference. You can hike either around either the L of the The Whale\'s Tail or you continue upstream, cross the concrete pad, follow the trail, take the right fork and you arrived nearly at the base of T2. For routes on the west side of Tower One in the vicinity of Vertigo and left, you should take the left fork (see above) and continue around the base of the Pickpocket Wall and catch the Redgarden Trail in the gully between Redgarden Wall and the West Ridge.

The park, located in central California, is home to both Yosemite Valley (THE Valley), Tuolumne Meadows, and several other less-visited climbing venues such as Wawona and Hetch Hetchy.  Climbers from all over the world have been visiting the Valley for decades (often staying in the little-changed walk-in campground of Camp 4) to test themselves against the great big wall climbs on El Capitan and Half Dome.  In addition to scores of historic aid routes, Yosemite Valley also has everything from long free climbs to world-class bouldering.  Don\'t expect a wilderness experience - the park is often overrun by tourists and climbers alike during the busy seasons.  In the summer, when the heat and humidity become stifling, Tuolumne offers a sub-alpine playground of beautiful domes known for run out slab and face climbs on famous Tuolumne knobs.  There are several campgrounds in the Park, the most famous of which is Camp 4.  Don\'t expect privacy or quiet, but do expect tons of climbers and being located right in the center of the action.  Camp 4 is a walk-in campground and lines will form each morning before the sun rises for openings.  Most of the other sites (such as the Pines and the Tuolumne campground) are reservation campgrounds which fill up months in advance.  Stays are limited from one month down to one week depending on the season.   Hipcamp has a great directory of the campgrounds, and for some of them you can even check availability and book them online.','Driving  From points west (San Francisco Bay area): Highway 120 and 140 lead into the park and Yosemite Valley.  120 continues east to Tuolumne Meadows and then drops down to the East Side of the Sierra via Tioga Pass.

From the east (Bishop, Mammoth, Reno):  During the summer months highway 120 can be followed west up over Tioga Pass and into Tuolumne Meadows and then down to the Valley.  Tioga Pass is frequently closed from mid-October to late-May.  Mass Transit  Yosemite roads are crowded!  Consider YARTS, the only public transit to Yosemite National Park.

Tuolumne Meadows is a beautiful, serene place without many of the tourist popularity issues plaguing Yosemite Valley these days. The usual Tuolumne \"season\" for climbing runs from May through mid-Fall or so.  Some adjacent areas often grouped together with Tuolumne in guidebooks are included in the High Sierra and Lee Vining Canyon / Tioga Road areas on Mountain Project.  The main campground in the middle of the meadows is Tuolumne Meadows Campground, operated by the National Park. It\'s generally open from July through September. Like all campgrounds in the park and along most of Lee Vining Canyon, there\'s a fee to stay there. The nearest free camping is all the way across Tioga Pass, on BLM land near the town of Lee Vining where 120 crosses 395, and east of there around Mono Lake.

By staying near the left edge of the ridge (above Cathedral Gully) and with careful route finding we were able to make it down to the notch without too much difficulty. From here you scramble up 3rd class ledges and ramps with only minor bushwhacking until you\'re nearly to the summit of HCR.

Imagine large granite spires of all shapes and sizes surrounded by beautiful glaciers and mountains as far as the eye can see and that\'s the Bugaboos.  All the rock is alpine granite and the quality on most routes is superb, even those which are not considered classics.  Routes range from a few hundred feet tall to a few thousand and offer anything from ridge scrambles and moderate free climbs to hard test pieces and multi-day big walls.                The climbing season is generally June to September with July and August having the best chance of good weather.  But be prepared for any kind of weather, it can storm at anytime and it snows every month of the year.  Temperatures can vary greatly depending on what side of a spire you\'re climbing on (North, South, East, West), if the sun\'s out or not, or if it\'s windy so plan accordingly.  An ice axe and crampons are mandatory to be safe especially later in the season when the glaciers can become a little more troublesome to negotiate due to melting.  Glacier travel skills are recommended for getting to and from most climbs unless you\'re staying near the campground.                There are several options for staying in the park when your visiting.  The most comfortable but also the most expensive is the Conrad Kain Hut which is managed by the Alpine Club of Canada and will cost you $25 a night (Canadian) per person as of 2013.  But provides you with a warm dry place to hang out in foul weather, a kitchen with running water and lights for late night reading.  Other more cost effective options are the campgrounds, with the Applebee campground being the most popular by far.  It will cost you $10 (Canadian) a night per person (pay at the Kain hut) and is basically a large area of somewhat flat rocks to place your tent on.  It does offer you a toilet, racks for hanging gear and food and great views which make the price seem more reasonable.','The Bugaboo Provincial Park is located in the Purcell range of  British Columbia, off of Highway 95.  To get to the Bugaboos travel 17 miles north of Radium Hotsprings or 48 miles south of Golden on Highway 95 depending on where your coming from to the really small town of Brisco.  Head west on a dirt road that has a sign for the park and goes past a lumber mill.  Follow the dirt road over the Columbia River and up into the mountains for 28.5 miles.  There are several turn offs along the road but there are signs at most of them for the Bugaboos otherwise just stay on the main road.

It stands as a must do for the 5.12 climber.  Another standout test piece is \'Wind in the Willows Extension\' (5.12d) which sports 110 feet of intense granite climbing.   Recently, there has been a resurgence of development, especially at the hands of the dynamic duo of Marty Lewis and Kevin Calder, who have almost doubled the number of sport climbs in just a couple of seasons, adding numerous new 5.11 classics to the area, including a three pitch affair.

ItÂ’s one of 4 canyons in this area that drain into the Green River from the east and it hosts a number of interesting climbing objectives in its 12ish mile length. The region is administered by the BLM and is currently under threat of development by the oil and gas industry.   This canyon has a long history as evidenced by the Barrior Canyon Style pictographs in its upper reaches and the 1836 inscription near the mouth of the canyon by French-Canadian trapper D. Julian. The first climbers to explore this area were Ron Olevsky and Dave Monduea who made several trips into the canyon in Â‘84 that ended for reasons ranging from weather to rockfall. On Halloween, Ron returned alone and soloed a 4-pitch line on The Witch calling it Midnight Rider. The next year, Ron and Dave returned with Dale Kruse and climbed The Warlock, which is likely the most impressive tower in the canyon. Other towers in the canyon that are of interest to climbers include The Cauldrons, Corner Tower, and the Kachina Spires.   The rock here is wingate and although the towers have been climbed, the potential for new routes along the canyon rim is extensive. Despite this and the fact that Hell Roaring Canyon has been listed in at least 4 guidebooks, you are likely to have the place to yourself if you choose to climb here. Come prepared for an adventure.','There are three approaches to Hell Roaring Canyon. All approaches begin from HW 313.   Mineral Bottom Approach- (for Corner Tower or routes near the mouth of the canyon) From HW 313 turn west onto Mineral Bottom Road which, after a dozen miles on dirt, drops you down to the Green River via the Horsethief Trail switchbacks. (ItÂ’s the same approach as for Moses to this point.) Turn right at the bottom and follow an old mining road upstream past the mouth of Mineral Canyon and for several more miles to the mouth of Hell Roaring Canyon. It is possible to drive up Hell Roaring Canyon for a couple miles but a landslide blocks further vehicular traffic. Note: The road along the Green River is often impassable. A high clearance 4x4 is required for this approach.   Rim Rappel Approach (for The Witch, Warlock, Cauldrons, or routes in the middle section of the canyon) From HW 313, turn right on Mineral Point Rd. (This is the road with the Horsethief Campground. It is 1/4 mile before the Mineral Bottom Rd. if youÂ’re driving toward the Park on 313. You will know youÂ’re on the right road because the 60-site campground will be on your left just after you leave HW313) From here the approach requires some attention if itÂ’s your first time. Mark you mileage when you turn onto Mineral Point Rd. At about 3.8 miles you want to stay left on the better road. This takes you past a bluff on your right. About 3.2 miles later (or 7 miles from HW313) you pass a small tower at the end of the bluff with a wide crack splitting it. From the tower, backup 50 meters and look for a rough road going left and then continue across the desert . You will come to a second bluff on your right after about 1.3 miles. Take a right here (road gets rougher) around the end of the second bluff and drive straight at the rim and the towers. The road ends at a campsite. A 4x4 is recommended for this approach though you could probably get a Subaru out there if you were motivated. The rim is a short walk from camp. To find the rappel anchors, hike to the rim and scramble down the first tier to a point where the towers extend away from you in a row. Look to your left for an obvious gash (cairn) that takes you down one more level. From here scramble down and left past a small tree to a small alcove containing two bolts with chains. Use caution.    Spring Canyon Bottom Road Approach Â– (for The Kachina Spires or climbs in the upper section of the canyon) If driving toward the Park on HW313, turn right on Spring Canyon Bottom Rd. (this is a dirt road) 8.2 miles from the junction of HW313 and HW191. You will pass a BLM Kiosk and parking viewpoint on the left just before you reach this road. Follow this road for approximately 1 mile and then go straight/left at the Dunbinky Well Road junction. Continue along Spring Canyon Bottom Rd for a few miles until you cross a cattle guard. Immediately after the cattle guard there is a small dirt road that veers off to the left and goes for 200 meters to the rim of Hell Roaring Canyon. The Kachina Spires are obvious from the rim.',38.5906,-109.95,'Moab Area','/v/moab-area/105716711'),(359,106325836,'/v/sports-challenge-rock---east-face/106325836','Sports Challenge Rock - East Face Rock Climbing','This side of the Sports Challenge formation plays host to a couple of Josh classics, namely Clean and Jerk 5.10c and Leave It To Beaver 5.12a  The routes are very steep if not overhanging and mostly climb incredibly good rock.','Same',34.0141,-116.169,'Sports Challenge Rock','/v/sports-challenge-rock/106325842'),(360,106325842,'/v/sports-challenge-rock/106325842','Sports Challenge Rock Rock Climbing','This formation is, by its position and merit, the centerpiece of the Real Hidden Valley.

Like all great peaks, there is no easy way to the summit.  The famous Austrian guide Conrad Kain, author of the first two routes on Robson, proclaimed upon first sight of the peak, \"God made the mountains, but good God! who made Robson?\"  This complex mountain has many distinct characters, depending on the aspect.  The North Face is known for its steep ice walls, the south side for complex, \"gargoyle\" studded rock &amp; snow ridges, and the legendary Emperor Face, rising over 9000\' from the valley below, for its daring mixed lines that push the limits of modern alpine abilities.    Although the \"Wishbone Arete\" was selected for Steck &amp; Roper\'s \"Fifty Classic Climbs of North America\", this is generally considered a poor choice by Canadian Rockies &amp; \'50 Classics\' connoiseurs alike, as a number of better lines exist on the peak.  Sean Dougherty, author of \"Select Alpine Climbs in the Canadian Rockies\" calls the line \"...somewhat over-rated considering the amount of loose rock &amp; the long approach.\"  The mountain\'s impressive size and intimidating vertical relief make one-day ascents uncommon.  Weather is a major factor in this part of the Canadian Rockies, and the mountain is said to create its own weather.

The Uberfall Rock Climbing','Major Features: The Uberfall is the first section of rock you encounter as you walk north from the steel bridge that separates the Trapps from the Nears.  On most in-season weekend days, a Preserve ranger is parked at the Uberfall, and it\'s a very social area.  Lest you think the Uberfall is named for the trickle (or, in season, the pouring) of water that descends down the escarpment here, Dick Williams wrote in his 1991 guide: The Uberfall acquired its name, according to Fritz Weissner in a 1960 Appalachia article, from \'the method used in the descent of letting oneself, with outstretched arms, fall across the four-foot gap between the massif and a huge block (Susie A) above the road\'.   For our purposes, routes in this section include the beginning of the cliff -- the big whitish face you pass closest to, just where the carriage road takes a slight turn, is Katzenjammer.  We\'ll end the Uberfall section just past the striking, right-leaning crack, Ken\'s Crack. The very last route in this section is the corner system of Trapped Like a Rat, which starts with a left-leaning hand crack, just behind the kiosk, the Hans Krauss plaque, and is almost directly across from the vault toilet (the \"Uberpooper\"). The next section is b. Jackie and friends.  There are two landmarks within the Uberfall: the Gerdie Block is a huge block leaning against the cliff with the routes Herdie Gerdie, Dirty Gerdie, and Nurdie Gerdie (aka Dogs in Heat); on the block\'s right side is the short crack of Red Cabbage.  Just below the carriage road across from Nosedive is another big block -- the Mental Block.  It contains one of the Gunks\' true crack lines, Sonja, and several other harder cracks, which face the road.  Approach:  Most Uberfall routes start almost directly from the carriage road.  A trail runs along the cliff between The Brat and the Gerdie Block.  Descents from most routes involves walking off; most Uberfall routes are single-pitch.  Closer to the very beginning, you\'ll be able to walk back and scramble down behind the cliff.  It\'s a good idea to familiarize yourself with the Uberfall Descent, which provides the walkoff for the majority of Uberfall routes as well as many beyond it.','',41.7371,-74.1885,'The Trapps','/v/the-trapps/105798818'),(396,107037580,'/v/b-jackie-and-friends/107037580','b.

(and if you like those, make sure you head to the next section for The Spring (P1)).  Uphill from Groovy, you\'ll find In the Groove, then the gully-to-chimney of Silly Chimney, which marks the northern extent of this area.  Past this, you\'ll see the yellow rock of the Yellow Wall.  Approach: The trail to High E scampers up in between boulder problems (pic to follow) - as you\'re walking down the carriage road, look for the Twilight Zone roof, then the next huge buttress over a roof features \"The Move\" of High E.  The next trail down heads up directly to Ants\' Line, and can also be used for High E.  Descent: The High E rappel line was one of the first sets of bolts to appear, courtesy of the Mohonk Preserve.  It heads down the gully to climber\'s right of High E; three rappels with one rope (if you\'re linking the last two raps, watch the rope ends) get you to the ground.  It\'s a good idea to familiarize yourself with this rappel.  There is a set of bolts shared by the first pitches of Sleepwalk, Ent Line and Ants\' Line.   You can also rappel from the top of Bonnie\'s Roof (two ropes mandatory - it\'s free-hanging the entire way) or Ursula (one rope from the top to a mid-cliff station).  The P1 anchor for Ursula, shared by Groovy is my least favorite in situ anchor on the cliff.

Climbing in Northern Arizona began in the late 1950\'s with the first ascent of the Mace in Sedona, done by visiting climbers, Bob Kamps, TM Herbert, and Dave Rearick.  In the years to follow many of the major formations and summits throughout Northern Arizona would be pioneered, and an age of vast exploration was set in motion.  As Tim Toula writes in his classic guide, A Cheap Way To Fly, \"I entered thru the historical gate of the Flagstaff climbing scene in the fall of 1978 when climbing was still much more of an underground sport than it is today.  There was a mystique about climbing then that was hard to grasp.  Perhaps it was because there were so few climbers then.  Names like Baxter, Coats, Davidson, and later, Murray, Gault, and Mattson floated thru the air like phantoms.  Their names heard often, but their talents seldom seen\". Check this book out for a more comprehensive slice of the early history of Northern Arizona climbing. At twenty some years old, this is still one of few sources for local areas.  Now a days that list of names has grown tremendously as a constant stream of talent pours out of Flagstaff, which is the heart of the Northern Arizona climbing scene. With all the development of the last couple decades, Flagstaff is now poised to start turning out some world class climbers. The age of exploration that began in the late 50\'s has not only continued to this day, but has blossomed into a collective energy that really defines the community here. There is always something new to check out, and hidden gems are still being discovered in surprising numbers.   Take a look at Joel Unema\'s, grassroutesclimbing.com/. for stories and photos about local areas, and interviews with local route developers. It\'s a cool project and will hopefully turn into a means to record and revel in the colorful history of Northern Arizona rock climbing.     	  	              	      	  	    Steve Grossman (during his Royal Robbins phase) turns the Tralfamadore Roof on the second ascent in 1976. Paul Davidson belays. Volunteer Canyon, AZ   	   Trad Climbing Northern Arizona has long been held as a bastion of traditional climbing, and for good reason.  With the sumptuous single pitch basalt crags like *Paradise Forks, The Overlook, *Volunteer Canyon, and *The Waterfall, Northern Arizona is a hard rock trad climber\'s dream with easily accessed four star routes.  Add to that the gritty, character building back country adventures of the Grand Canyon National Park, the mysterious quartzite Hualapai Wall, and the soft stone spire paradise, the *Sedona Area, you might just find yourself slipping into a heart pounding state of trad daddy nirvana.      	  	              	      	  	    Worth The Weight The Gold Wall, Paradise Forks  Arizona  Photo: blakemccordphoto.com   	   Sport Climbing If you are looking for sport routes in Northern Arizona, you won\'t have to look too hard. To the east lay crags like the Winslow Wall and *Jacks Canyon south of Winslow. Around Flagstaff you will find great crags like  The Pit, The Doctor\'s Office , the Mt. Elden areas Solitude Canyon and Red Dragon, as well as,  The Peaks Crag and the Hobo Jungle on the San Francisco peaks. Way up north are the unique limestone crags the Virgin River Gorge and the The Arizona Strip. Sport climbing is alive and well throughout Northern Arizona.  Whether you are looking for steep pockets, or off vertical crimps, the list of fine crags and excellent routes is sure to keep you happily swinging through the air, one way or another....     	  	              	      	  	    Keith Ladzinski photo of Whitney Boland climbing Vesper. Lime Kiln Canyon.   	   Bouldering And then there is the bouldering....  Flagstaff is world renown for it\'s pocketed limestone roofs at areas like Priest Draw, but these roofs are tucked away in folds all over Northern Arizona. And though the double digit lines keep adding up at places like the Hinterlands and Cherry Canyon, even the beginning boulderer is going to find a slew of premiere challenges at crags like Buffalo Park, Lake Mary Areas, and  Turkey Tanks. From the Fontainebleau like slopers of Kelly Canyon, to the sharp dacite crimps of  Gloria\'s,  Northern Arizona is a boulderer\'s paradise.     	  	              	      	  	    Matt Gentile at one with his environment on Renegade Roof.  Photo Ken Etzl   	  Considerations Northern Arizona has some of the most pristine and unpolluted crags of anywhere I have been in the US. Please help us keep them that way.   We tend to take care of our crags, and most of the routes listed here have adequate anchors or other fixed hardware, if they have any at all. However, one may encounter a few old, rotting pins in places like Sedona and in the Grand Canyon. Much of the original hardware in Secret Canyon on Mt. Elden is old and suspect. Crags that see a lot of action like Jacks Canyon, The Winslow Wall, and The Pit also have aging fixed hardware that wasn\'t all that great to begin with. I believe an era of route maintenance with glue-in bolt replacement looms before us.  Many of the anchor systems on single pitch routes throughout Northern Arizona employ the \"fixed carabiner\" style anchor which is specifically set up for easy, safe lowering. If one of the two carabiners is worn past the point of common sense, please leave one of yours in place and take the old one home with you. They make great conversation pieces....   And while a lot of the routes listed here are well traveled, it can be said that Northern Arizona is full of adventurous climbing. Always check your holds, especially on the softer stone.

Sitting at 7000\' it is tucked in between the Mogollon Rim to the south, and the San Francisco Peaks just north of town. Flagstaff is draped over historic Route 66, and has everything a visiting climber may need, including buffets and chain healthfood stores.  Cheap motels, and plenty of public land for free camping.  Groovy coffee houses, and late night entertainment downtown.   Rest days can be filled with excellent hiking and peak bagging, miles and miles of world class mountain biking, or deep and narrow Canyoneering adventures. Or just take it easy and wander about the historic downtown which is filled with gear shops, art galleries, brewpubs, and a few good restaurants.

Flagstaff also sees an average of 100\" of snow a year.... Yes despite most folks impressions of Arizona, we represent the winter months quite well here in Northern Arizona. Good winter climbing can be had throughout Northern Arizona at the Arizona Strip crags way up north, as well as, The Pit and Higher Solitude Canyon right around Flagstaff, and Jacks Canyon to the east. Winter is also the season for Sedona climbing. If the cold has really set in many retreat to the Central Arizona crags.   Springtime is notoriously windy, and has been known to drive people mad! Especially in the high deserts. Luckily, this is really the only detracting element of the season. Otherwise it\'s prime time for crags like The Waterfall, Paradise Forks, The Overlook, The Red Dragon, Lower Solitude Canyon and many, many more as perfect temps can easily be chased down.  The summer months bring about an average high of 88 degrees during July. Then it\'s Monsoon Season to the rescue! Flagstaff itself receives an annual 21\" of rain a year, and much of it comes during the Monsoons which are powerful storm systems. Monsoon Season typically lasts through September. Attractive areas this time of year include The Hobo Jungle, The Peaks Crag, West Elden, The Winslow Wall, and more.  And of course, our favorite season Fall, does not disappoint in Northern Arizona. With usually sunny, moderate temperature days, most of our premiere crags are in perfect conditions. Whether you are chasing around the fall colors on the San Francisco Peaks, or marveling at the otherworldly dryness of the desert crags, Fall in Northern Arizona should not be missed.

This trophy status just adds to its mystique and popularity . Especially on weekends during the gentle months of summer, crowds of people ascend its hut-capped summit plateau, and even more fall along the trailside or are turned back, unprepared or simply unlucky.   To protect this busy season circus from becoming a stop and go human traffic jam, the Inyo National Forest\'s solution has been to create the Mount Whitney Zone. Access to this area during the peak season is controlled by strict limits on single day visitors, and even fewer overnight backpackers. Advance reservations are in much higher demand than are available, so now a lottery decides who will attempt Whitney and its near neighbors (though a small number are available for walk in visitors at the ranger station in Lone Pine).  Single day visits are free and unrestricted from Whitney Portal to Lower Boy Scout Lake, Lone Pine Lake, and via Meysan Lake to Mounts Irvine and Mallory. All crags described on the Whitney Portal page are also free to use.  Day use or overnight permits are required elsewhere in the Zone. Everything in the Lone Pine Creek drainage at slightly higher elevation than the above mentioned free sites has its access controlled.  Backpackers from further trail heads have fewer restrictions on visiting and leaving from the interior sides of Whitney, Russell and their neighbors.

There are many popular campsites along both of these trails. Cross country travel is possible from the Treasure Lakes Trail to the Bishop Pass Trail. Both trails are short and easy. As stated this is a very popular area.  The Evolution Group is accessible from the trailhead at Lake Sabrina, which splits at Blue Lake to take you to either Mount Thompson (left) or (right) Mount Darwin, etc. The trails are a little longer but still reasonably moderate.

The big mountain in this region is Mount Humphreys, it\'s visible from many parts of the Sierra and is one of the more difficult peaks, being just shy of 14,000 feet. Humphreys Basin is a high tundra like environment, with grass and small lakes, farther north the Pine Creek basin curiously has peaks west of the main crest which are higher. Royce Lakes is a magical spot, surrounded by multiple high peaks, desolate, lifeless and yet hauntingly beautiful. Merriam Peak has recently seen multiple long rock climbs established on its north buttress.  While Mount Humphreys is obvious from Highway 395, the peaks west of Pine Creek remain aloof and mysterious, even as you hike up the Pine Creek Pass Trail, they show their shapes reluctantly. From Royce Col however, their true grandeur is revealed, and even west of those lies the highly desirable peak; Seven Gables.  When hiking up to Granite Park one cannot help but be impressed by the rocky peaks and pinnacles to the west - there are sure to be some climbs over there just waiting to be discovered.','From Hwy 168 west out of Bishop, the North Lake Trailhead splits off right, after passing through Aspendell.

Pine Creek Trailhead can be reach by driving west off Hwy 395 through Rovanna and up to a rugged parking area south of the Tungsten Mill. The trailhead accesses Pine Creek Pass, Royce Lakes and through Granite Park to Italy Pass, plus it\'s advisable to use this trail to access the peaks west of Merriam, Royce and Feather, like Seven Gables.

To the north lies Mount Ritter and Banner Peak, Ritter is a very big mountain, don\'t underestimate it, and while Banner has a walk up route there are some more technical climbs on its east face.  There used to be some impressive small glaciers in this area, with real crevasses which lent the area a feel of mountains further north, who knows how they\'ll fare with the climate change.  Both The Minarets and Ritter/Banner are mostly accessed from the east, via the Minaret Road from Mammoth Lakes.

West of Mount Morrison the peaks, except for Red Slate Mountain, lay back a bit on the main crest, with Morrison, Laurel and Bloody Mountain therefore gaining dominance. The rock east of the main crest is not granite, but sedimentary in nature.  The McGee Creek trail follows a flat valley southwards for quite a distance before kicking in and heading steeply up to the Big McGee Basin. The trial eventually heads over McGee Pass and down into Fish Creek, which is quite a hike. To the west of Big McGee Lake lies Red and White Mountain - a very worthy and daunting peak.  There are some easy peaks on the west to east ridge south of Big McGee Lake which have some very nice views down into Pioneer Basin and across to the Abbot Group.

Charlotte Lake is also a very popular camping spot, and there\'s a backcountry ranger hut here.  While Rae Lakes are very popular Sixty Lakes can be empty, perhaps because it\'s harder to get to, but it\'s well worth the trip, it\'s very remote and beautiful with Mount Cotter and Mount Clarence King being spectacular peaks.

Eastern Trailheads Kearsarge Pass: Take the Onion Valley Road west from Independence to the large parking loop at the trailhead (there\'s camp sites here too). Kearsarge Pass allows quick easy access over the main crest, for Charlotte Dome head down and past Charlotte Lake, do the same for Rae Lakes and Sixty Lake Basin, but stop and camp at the lake because the next day you\'ll be heading over Glen Pass, then either down to Rae Lakes or over Sixty Lake Col to Gardiner or Clarence King.  Either way and whatever your destination these are long and arduous hikes, especially toting climbing equipment.  Golden Trout Lakes/Dragon Pass: From the Onion Valley Parking Loop there\'s a trail which runs north, up into the Golden Trout Lakes, and Dragon Peak basins, from the loop there\'s a big waterfall, the trail heads up old scree and passes this on the right, then crosses it\'s top and follows a depression until a meadow is reached, Golden Trout Lakes is to the left and Dragon Pass is to the right. This meadow is very scenic, with large towers to the north, there is camping at the two lakes beneath Dragon Peak.

Dries quickly, because it gets direct sun all day.  Similar exposure to Reed\'s.  Very secluded and un-developed.  As said on Supertopo by The Warbler, \"No bolts, no folks.\"','The approach is around 1 1/2 hours.  It is quite pleasant hiking along the Old Big Oak Flat Road.  Park at the woodlot after El Cap meadow.  Follow the directions for Little Wing and then continue until you come to a large rock slide. (About 45 minutes) This is where the road used to switch-back to gain elevation.  You will not see the road, but look up the rock slide where you will see an old retaining wall.  Scramble up the boulders, until you are at the base of the wall.  Next traverse to the trees, where you will regain the road.  From here hike to Rainbow Point. There is an old railing and USGS plaque here. From Rainbow Point hike for about 7 minutes and then head straight up into the woods.  You can\'t see the cliff, because you are in the trees.  Head up steep slope for less than 5 minutes and you will begin to see the cliff. This will take you to the base of Duncan Imperial.
