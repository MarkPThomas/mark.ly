It is a quantitative topic composed of facts, figures, and specs. How much does a piece of gear weigh? How strong is it? What is the range of protection? Etcetera, etcetera. Of course, then there are the less tangible aspects of different designs that are hard to compare. All of these considerations must be brought together when deciding strategically what gear we should purchase with our limited funds, or haul up with our practical limitations outside.<br />And yet, all of these quantitative strategies must be brought to a far less quantifiable world. Equipment rarely breaks. It is usually the quality of the placement or the rock that fails. One rarely knows exactly what sizes are needed or how much redundancy they should have in their rack. For those that really care, there are many details to keep track of, and a lot of uncertainty.<br />While I&#8217;m often pretty meticulous in planning for climbs, I have difficulty working with these stale, lifeless numbers. I need to give meaning to them - meaning that gear catalogues never seem to provide. So that is why I made the following figures for this article. Frankly, saying that a #3 Camalot or its equivalent should be brought to a climb means nothing to me.

In the simpler case to consider, you might be on a crack climb. The topo will call out the width of the crack, which as a number might be hard to fully understand, but it is very important information. It tells you both the type of gear needed to protect the section and also the type of climbing to expect.<br />Figure 1 shows the various types of moves that work on a crack of a given size, based off of my own body measurements. Where there is overlap but one technique is probably preferred, I made the cutoff on the extreme end of the preferred technique. Later on I&#8217;ll also consider the larger sizes.',27176,NULL),(29316,901,3,3,'Relating Gear to the Rock','In the following sections I look at active pro  and passive pro. I&#8217;ve organized the charts by gear manufacturer, first showing the range &amp; distribution of ranges covered in the various sizes, and next by showing the weight of the gear in relation to the protection size covered.<br />To aid in comparing between manufacturers, in most of the charts I underlay the size &amp; weight distributions of Black Diamond gear as a common benchmark. I chose BD because it seems to be the most popular manufacturer and because they have the largest range of SLCD sizes available. The size charts should help you visualize the range distribution and overlap of a given piece of pro, and the amount of redundancy between cam models of the same manufacturer. The weight graphs can help in visualized what I&#8217;ll call &#8220;weight efficiency&#8221;, which relates the price paid in the weight of a piece of pro to achieve a given range of protection.',NULL,NULL),(29317,901,4,3,'Active Pro','In this section I compare various types of active pro - mostly Spring Loaded Camming Units (SLCDs), but also Ball Nutz &amp; Big Bros. Ranges are those provided by the manufacturers and might not necessarily be those that are appropriate for the gear, which I discuss in the last section of the article. One benefit of using active pro versus passive pro is that the protection range is a continuum between the maximum and minimum sizes, so you can expect a piece of pro to protect anything within that size range that the rock geometry will allow based on how the pro works.<br />For those not familiar with SLCDs, some of the basic differences to consider are the number of camming heads, the number of stems in the cam, and whether or not the pivot points of the cam heads are aligned or offset.<br />Regarding camming heads, the standard cams have 4 camming heads and the tri-cam units (TCUs) have have 3 camming heads, and therefore a narrower profile. Since TCUs have fewer heads, they exert higher stresses on the rocks since there is less bearing area to hold the cam in, but the narrower profile allows placements in narrower pockets or flares.<br />A basic consideration for stems is that single stems have less material in the cam and are more flexible. This means that the stem bends better over edges and that the cam is less likely to walk (move) as the rope tugs on the pro.  Double stems can be nice in that you can more easily pull the trigger to contract the cam heads for placement (try doing it with one finger on a single stem!).<br />Most cams have all of the camming heads rotate off of one axis, but for some specialized cams, and a prominent feature in Black Diamond&#8217;s cams, the cam heads on one side rotate around a different axle &amp; axis than the heads on the other side of the stem.

Micro stoppers tend to protect the smallest sizes and are usually made of a softer metal to encourage bonding/fusing with the rock surface to hold them into place (e.g. copper heads). They also have narrower profiles to make it easier to make placements in smaller cracks, though at the cost of less variation in protection sizes. Black Diamond&#8217;s MicroStoppers have more of a box shape to them that allows different types of placements.<br />As seen in Figure 12, nuts are used as protection only in the very small sizes. There is also a lot more overlap in ranges as compared to SLCDs, probably as a result of the more discrete protection dimensions actually available in between the maximum &amp; minimum sizes. Note that the smallest 2 sizes are weak enough to be rated only for body weight and are not appropriate for lead falls.

Is it a glacier? Maybe, maybe not. Even if it has metamorphosed into ice, it still may be a permanent snowfield. The critical feature that glaciers have is movement. The glacier may start out as a permanent snowfield or icefield, but eventually the weight of the ice becomes so great compared to the friction holding it in place that the body of ice moves downhill. At the same time, enough new snow is added to the glacier to constantly replenish the ice at the top of the glacier.<br />The area of a glacier that retains snow year-round is called the accumulation zone, and as the ice compacts, it moves downhill to an elevation where more melting occurs on the surface and eventually the presence of ice is due solely to ice that has moved downhill rather than remaining from prior years. This area of the glacier that completely melts out is called the ablation zone. The dividing line between the accumulation zone and the ablation zone is the firn line, and in mid-latitude glaciers it is easily visible, as in the photo above, as the lingering snow stays whiter while the melted out ablation zone is left dark and dirty in late season. Can you spot these features on the Palisade Glacier, picture above?<br />If the glacier is in equilibrium, the head and terminus of the glacier will remain stationary as the melt at the bottom matches the addition of ice at the top. Although the glacier may appear stationary, it is still moving and eroding.

Grinding occurs as the ice abrades rock and wears it down. Rock worn by a glacier is easily identified by the smooth glacial polish left behind from this. Contrary to popular conception, this is not the main mechanism of glacial erosion, as rocks such as granite abrade too slowly to account for the deep U-shaped valleys carved by glaciers.<br />Plucking is the main erosion mechanism of glaciers. All rocks have some cracks in them (also called joints). These are formed by the presence of tension. In granite and other metamorphic rocks, joints often form from the contraction of the rock as it cooled. These joints are weaknesses in the rock, and glacial ice tends to catch the edges of joints and &#8216;pluck&#8217; out shards of rock, peeling back the rock layer by layer.<br />Because of this, heavily jointed rock wears down much more quickly and dramatically than rock free of joints. This is also why although the bottoms of glacially carved valleys are smooth and rounded, the sides and headwalls of such valleys are usually very steep and often left as a continuous line of cliffs.  This is also why glacially carved canyons often have fairly flat bottoms interrupted by a series of distinct headwalls, called cirques. Parallel glacially carved valleys tend to leave knife-edge ridges with very steep rock faces on both sides. These ridges are called arêtes.<br />Alternatively, valleys eroded by water are V-shaped and twist and turn as water is deflected by various types of rock.

Lateral moraines form alongside the glacier as debris is pushed out from the side of the glacier or from debris that falls onto the edge of the glacier as the glacier undercuts neighboring cliffs. As the debris piles up, it protects the snow beneath from melting, causing these sides of the glacier to remain higher than the center. Medial moraines form when two glaciers flow together, trapping lateral moraines between them.<br />Once a glacier melts away, moraines are often the only clue of glaciation. Often the terminal and lateral moraines trap water in the valley carved by the glacier, forming a lake where the toe of the glacier once stood. This is how many of the natural lakes and ancient moraines at the mouths of the canyons in the eastern Sierra formed.<br />Glaciers are always growing and receding, so there are often multiple terminal moraines as the glacier pushes one up, recedes, and then pushes up another. Meltwater from the glacier tends to pile up behind these moraines, forming lakes at the toe of the glacier, called tarns. If a glacier recedes slowly enough, it may do this in many locations along it&#8217;s track, leaving behind a string of lakes, such as the &#8220;Numbered&#8221; lakes in the North Fork of Big Pine in the Palisades region of the High Sierra.<br />Because moraines are formed by eroded rock and mud pushed up into mounds, they are composed of rotten, friable rock and are very unstable. Not only are they formed in an unstable way, but moraines by existing glaciers are still being pushed. Climbing on moraines is unpleasant and can be dangerous due to falling rock. Take care whenever climbing on moraines and strategize ahead of time to take the line of lowest steepness as the moraine is more stable in these areas.<br />On some large moraines, enough mud and soil can collect on top to support plant life, such as on the toe of the Ruth Glacier. These moraines essentially become moving meadows and forests!',NULL,NULL),(29363,902,18,5,'Cleavers, Nunataks, and Roche Moutonnees','A cleaver is a ridgeline of rock that remains sticking up between various flows of a glacier, like a fin. They can provide means of climbing through a glacier that has heavy crevassing or an icefall. The easiest and most popular route on Mt Rainier, Disappointment Cleaver, ascends a cleaver to pass between the icefalls of two neighboring glaciers to reach the summit.<br />A nunatak is an exposed rocky element of a ridge, mountain, or peak that protrudes above the ice of a glacier or icefield. A number of the peaks in the Sierra Nevada are ancient nunataks.<br />Roche moutonnee is a rock or hill sculpted by glacial ice flowing over the top. Usually the uphill side is scoured smooth by the grinding action of the ice, but the downhill side has a steep, fractured face that is left from glacial plucking.  Many of the domes in Tuolumne Meadows in Yosemite National Park are actually remnants of ancient roche moutonees.',NULL,NULL),(29364,902,19,3,'Glacial Kinematics','In this section I will talk briefly about the behavior of glacial ice and how it affects the form of a glacier.',NULL,NULL),(29365,902,20,5,'Creep and Glide','Glaciers move by a combination of glide and creep. Because ice is plastic when deformed slowly and under pressure, the glacial ice flows downhill like a slow river of ice. Creep is this movement by deformation. Glide is a rigid-body motion of the glacier as it slides down on a bed surface, usually lubricated by meltwater that flows between the bedrock and the underside of the glacier. Creep is what causes plucking, and glide is what causes grinding in glacial erosion.<br />In general glaciers move faster in the summer, both because the greater melting accelerates glide, and also the warming of the ice make it flow easier, accelerating creep. As such, icefall activity tends to increase during the summer months if it has any variation over the year. Because heat accelerates glacier motion, mid-latitude glaciers can move very fast, reach 1-3 ft of movement per day!',NULL,NULL),(29366,902,21,5,'Kinematic Waves','Because glacial ice flows, it has many characteristics of a liquid. One is the formation of kinematic waves. These waves are essentially slow-motion shockwaves in the ice that form from very heavy snow years and take years to propagate down the length of the glacier. The increase in load from the extra snow pushes the glacier down harder. When this snow melts or consolidates into the glacier, the glacier springs back up again.<br />This up and down motion travels down the glacier at a slow pace, but the size of the wave can be quite noticeable. The waves can reach 80 ft in height and move down the glacier faster than the flow of the ice itself, causing the terminus of the glacier to advance dramatically when it reaches the end. Keep in mind that these waves tend to accelerate the ice, which affects seracs and crevasses. At the front of the wave, crevasses tend to shrink, but may then become much larger behind the wave as the ice goes into tension. The waves would also increase the rate of serac fall as the wave passes through icefalls.',NULL,NULL),(29367,902,22,5,'Glacier Surges','Sometimes the speed of a glacier increases very suddenly, causing a surge in the ice, sometimes of up to <i>30 feet in a day</i>. This may be from a combination of accelerated glide, creep, and kinematic waves. Critical mass of the glacier or sudden detachment from the base rock layer may be other contributing factors. These surges can completely change the nature of a glacier, making a once passable glacier completely impassable due to the spread of icefalls and crevasses. The Muldrow glacier on Denali used to be an easy walk up until it surged in 1956. Now climbers must climb around the glacier or fly over it.',NULL,NULL),(29368,902,23,3,'Crevasses',NULL,NULL,NULL),(29369,902,24,4,'Ice Under Tension, Compression, and Shear','Ice is weak and brittle in tension, and strong and plastic in compression.  This basic tendency explains much about the formation of crevasses on glaciers, and the understanding of this behavior and where it occurs is key to understanding crevasses and knowing where to expect them. This knowledge is important in planning a route across a glacier, especially if crevasses are buried but you want to minimize the likelihood that you are crossing snow bridges.<br />In general, crevasses form in tension zones, where the ice undergoes tension. Compression zones on glaciers have few if any crevasses and are generally the way to go for route planning and choosing camps. These zones are formed by direct tension-compression of the ice as the glacier bends, or as a result of shear in the ice that occurs from flow differential.<br />The figure below shows the relationship between shear and tension. This is important as it explains why crevasses have the orientation that they do, which is also important for predicting crevasse patterns on a glacier. Basically, if a block of ice is subjected to shear (1), say from faster flowing ice, it develops an equal and opposite reaction (2), say from slower moving ice or the stationary ground. These forces would cause the ice segment to spin, except it then develops equilibrating shears (3) perpendicular to (1) and (2). These shear forces can be added up vectorially to get the resulting tension and compression forces, which are equal to [2*shear force]<sup>0.5</sup> and occur at 45 degrees to the direction of shear.',NULL,NULL),(29370,902,25,4,'Types of Crevasses',NULL,NULL,NULL),(29371,902,26,5,'Transverse Crevasses','When a glacier travels over a convex surface, such as flat ground rolling into a steeper slope or the glacier rolling over a low bulge, the ice layer bends as the top layers are put into tension and the bottom layers are compressed. Another way to think of it is that the top layer must accelerate to keep up with the bottom layer as it sweeps over a greater distance to round the bulge. This tends to pull the ice apart. Because the tension develops along the fall line, transverse crevasses tend to form as straight crevasses across glaciers, perpendicular to the flow. Conversely, at the bottom of drops or in bowls, the ice is in a compression zone and is generally free of crevasses.',NULL,NULL),(29372,902,27,5,'Marginal Crevasses','Marginal crevasses form along the sides of a glacier due to the differential flow of the ice. Glaciers move faster in the center than at the edges, which are restrained by the stationary rock on the sides and beneath the shallower ice. This difference in flow rate causes shear in-line with the glacier flow, which causes tension to develop along 45o angles facing into the flow.<br />So in general, marginal crevasses form at the edges of a glacier at 45<sup>o</sup> <i>into</i> the flow. They can create barriers to entering and leaving a glacier, but routes can be planned through them so long as they cut diagonally onto the glacier in line with the crevasses. It is because of the continual development of marginal crevasses that routes usually travel down the center of the glacier, because crevasses there are more intermittent.<br />Also, keep in mind that the ice between the crevasses is under compression (remember the ice shear figure?), but may be in slender strips. This could leave those sections of the glacier prone to buckling and crushing, making even these sections impassable.',NULL,NULL),(29373,902,28,5,'Transverse Crescentric Crevasses','Transverse crescentric crevasses are a blend of transverse and marginal crevasses and tend to form as a glacier rolls onto a steepening slope as it passes through a constriction.

The arc is convex facing uphill and concave facing downhill.',NULL,NULL),(29374,902,29,5,'Radial Crevasses','Radial crevasses form on the outside curve of a glacier as it rounds a corner. This outside edge travels faster to keep up with the flow, subjecting these outer regions to tension, creating straight radial crevasses, perpendicular to the flow, but radiating out from towards the center of the bend, like spokes on a wheel. Glacier routes tend to hug the inside of a bend because this region is generally free of radial crevasses and may actually be subjected to compression as the flow is slowed down here.',NULL,NULL),(29375,902,30,5,'Longitudinal Crevasses','Longitudinal crevasses form parallel to the flow of the glacier. They may form as a glacier passes over a bulge or ridge in line with the glacier, but they usually form near the terminus of the glacier as the ice spreads out laterally and becomes shallower, making it more sensitive to the underlying terrain. Because they form in line with the fall line, they are usually less of a barrier to travel, but it is more difficult to travel safely around them as a roped team.',NULL,NULL),(29376,902,31,5,'Seracs &amp; Icefalls','When a glacier flows off of a cliff or a very steep rise, transverse crevasses become so severe that the ice actually separates from the glacier, forming free-standing  blocks of ice that may be as large as office buildings. These provide barriers to travel when they form in large numbers, often requiring technical ice climbing to pass through them. These areas are called icefalls and are the ice analogy of a waterfall.Seracs pose objective hazards to climbers as they tend to topple, crushing anything in their path, or starting ice avalanches. Serac fall is often unpredictable, although it is more prevalent with faster moving glaciers.<br />In summer as glaciers accelerate, the rate of serac fall may also accelerate, but this isn&#8217;t always the case. Traveling around them at night might not be any safer than traveling around them in the day. However, the rate of collapse tends to be characteristic of a glacier, so the amount of hazard or the timing of serac collapse can be deduced by watching the glacier for a day or so and keeping track of the activity.',NULL,NULL),(29377,902,32,4,'Identifying Crevasses &amp; Icefalls from Topographic Maps','For safety, ease and speed of climbing, it is important to select good routes over glaciers. In general, routes should avoid climbing below or through icefalls, should enter and exit the glacier at strategic places, and to take a path of least resistance through the crevasses. Because of this, it is a good idea to scope out the glacier from a distance on the approach.<br />You can also predict ahead of time where the easy and difficult sections or safe and dangerous sections are. Based on the concepts I discussed in the previous section on crevasses, moats, and bergschrunds, you should be able to draw a rudimentary crevassing pattern on a topographic map. For example, see the figure below of the topo map, how I&#8217;d assume the crevasses are (and therefore where the easiest route goes), and a satellite photograph showing the actual state of the glacier.',NULL,NULL),(29378,902,33,4,'Identifying Buried Crevasses on the Glacier','When crevasses are buried under snow, it is important to spot them as soon as possible to make optimal route adjustments and avoid hazards.

Beyond this, there isn&#8217;t much one can do.',NULL,NULL),(29379,902,34,NULL,NULL,'In later season as the glacier begins to melt out, snow bridges begin to sag. Buried crevasses can be spotted by looking for these sagging snow bridges. Linear undulations in the glacier are a sign, especially if there is cracking in the snow surface. As this layer melts out and drops down, the troughs tend to fill with dirt and dust, darkening them. This can happen in drops too subtle to see without discoloration.<br />However, keep in mind that these may not actually be signs of crevasses. In addition to just being chance features in the glacier, in later seasons melt channels form on the glacier surface, which can be confused with crevasses. Windblown snow can take the form of dunes across the glacier, creating ripples with dips similar to a sagging snow bridge. So how do you tell crevasses apart from these false-positives?<br />If you know where to expect them ahead of time, and what sort of orientation they should have there, then you can more easily discern the appropriate patters. For example, meltwater channels fall down the fall line, so unless you are worried about the formation of longitudinal crevasses, sagging snow in this orientation is probably not an indicator of a crevasse.<br />Whenever the rope team gathers together, for food breaks or for making camp, it is important to ensure that there are no buried crevasses in the area. The lead climber should probe the area around them (ideally with an avalanche probe, as ski poles and ice axes cannot probe very deep) and the campsite then belay the climbers in.

At the time I figured the locking and instability was my rebuilt ACL loosening up. I was not in a sufficient insurance situation to dare get it diagnosed as I knew I couldn\'t afford treatment, and I didn\'t want to have a pre-existing condition once my employment and insurance situation improved. So I wore a brace, stopped jogging and skiing, and over the years saw my abilities to do long days of hiking and scrambling in the mountains slowly diminish. Recovery took longer, and my knee got more sore and stiff on the long rides between Berkeley and the Sierra. However, rock climbing rose to fill the gap . . . until last winter. I was getting strangely sore after climbing, and needed a post-climbing IPA a little too much for pain relief rather than relaxation. In January, climbing at Arch Rock with my good friend, Nic, burnt me out in a day with only a few pitches of 5.10 climbing, and I was left with a lingering background pain that wouldn\'t go away.

The first surgeon said that I was heading straight towards a total knee replacement, and at 29, I was way too young for such a thing.

Since we had no idea how much it would be covered with snow and ice, Joel and I also brought our ice tools in addition to our crampons, helmet, rope, pro etc. and whatever gear we thought we&#8217;d need for two days of snow camping.<br />We had a leisurely start, parking our car along the Whitney Portal road and descending down through the campground to reach the trailhead to Meyson Lakes around 9am. From there we followed the discontinuous trail as it traveled between some cabins, before ascending above them and contouring around the ridge. After some switchbacks we entered Meyson Canyon, following the bare trail as it traversed the north slopes.  I was surprised at how nice the trail really was &#8211; wide, flat, and mostly clear of rocks and roots.<br />As we hiked higher, Lone Pine Peak towered above us to the south, and for entertainment I examined its slopes for possible lines of ascent.

At the top of this, Mt Irvine towered above like a jagged citadel. This was my favorite part of the approach.

They looked very surreal as they were bathed in the cold azure glow of the full moon. We pressed on in the dark without a word, hiking at a pace I could barely sustain, with only the sound of boots clomping along the trail &#8211; time seemed to stand still. Meadows came and went, and in the dark everything looked the same.  Suddenly the stillness of time was broken by the yipping of coyotes somewhere out in one of the meadows &#8211; we were certainly in wild country now.<br><br>Oddly enough it was a relief for me when we reached the first set of switchbacks. My legs were dying from the brutal pace &#8211; I had never hiked so fast for so long in all my life. We slowed down a bit on the hill. In addition to this, my legs were further relieved by pushing upward for a change rather than forward.

There were 13 people signed up for today, making it the largest Sierra Challenge gathering to date, and everyone showed up.

Everyone attempting this route was going to free-solo  it apart from rappelling off the gendarmes, which made me uncomfortable since one would be committed to finishing the route after that point, and I wasn&#8217;t sure how well I would handle the exposure. Luckily Michael Graupe had agreed to join me on the route, giving us the option to set up a roped belay beyond the rappel if needed. He carried the rope, and I carried all of the pro .<br><br>True to the trip reports I read of earlier Sierra Challenges, Bob set off 10 minutes after the starting time. The pace wasn&#8217;t too bad, but then again, we were on a nice, flat trail at the beginning of the day. Michael and I were probably carrying the heaviest packs of the day, but I managed to keep up just fine. Soon we left the main trail and continued along a series of faint use-trails  that wound their way up the boulder-strewn meadows as we climbed higher above tree-line, dropping occasionally into a pristine lake or creek as we ascended.<br><br>For those of us heading to Conness&#8217; North Ridge, Bob had planned to also include North Peak as an extra goodie along the route.

Oddly, there were artificially frosted pine trees lining the road between Mammoth Ski Resort and Minaret Summit. When we reached Minaret Summit, we walked across the open meadow to get a nice view of our climbing objectives before short-cutting down the open slope to the road. We made good progress on the road while keeping at a relaxed yet steady pace. Midway down the road we met two backpackers heading out from Shadow Lake.

I came up with a yummy combination of spreading peanut butter on the cream of an Oreo cookie and putting the cookie back together. As a trail food, it tasted surprisingly good. Sadly, my idea of wrapping a ball of peanut butter in a wad of sandwich meat proved less palatable, even after two days out.<br><br>Our next good view of Banner and Ritter was at Shadow Lake.

After scrambling through a series of cliffs and realizing our error, we backtracked and found a nice campsite under some pine trees and next to a river that was fed by the glacier above.

It was then that I stumbled across Bob Burd&#8217;s trip report on the peak, which was by far the highest quality of info that I had found about the peak on the internet.

Eventually the date of the climb had fallen on March , which was the beginning of  my Spring Break.  By this time the Shasta trip seemed unlikely to happen, and I had opted to join SPer Grandwazoo on his own attempt on the route the following weekend.

I headed back over to check on him when he finally climbed up around the second rock bank and then collapsed like a rag doll.<br><br>&#8220;Oh crap,&#8221; I thought to myself. &#8220;What is wrong here?!&#8221; Guy said he was fine except for his leg, but that the little &#8216;tweak&#8217; had finally caused his leg to give out without any warning. One minute he was walking fine, and the next he was tripping. He could bear weight and move it around, but he couldn&#8217;t raise his left leg higher than an inch or so. We had climbed 8,000 ft so far, and I think the effort had finally broken Guy! I thanked my lucky stars that we had finished traversing through the hard terrain, so at least we weren&#8217;t in any danger. Avalanche Gulch should be straightforward to descend, and glissading should help make up for lost time.<br><br>I suggested we head down immediately, but Guy was feeling pretty pissed off about his leg. He said he definitely couldn&#8217;t make the summit, but he didn&#8217;t want to prevent me from summitting. I didn&#8217;t like the idea of leaving him and suggested we just start descending, but Guy insisted that he was fine, and that maybe a rest would do his leg some good for the descent, and maybe he could even get a head start down. I ruled out his heading down alone as I was concerned about his leg, and the fact that he didn&#8217;t know the route out too well. I conservatively estimated that it would take me 3 hours to make it to the summit and back here, putting us on our descent by 3pm.

Some patchy gray clouds blew in below - nothing too serious, but definitely a sign to get moving in case they got any larger. I lugged myself the final distance across the summit crater and up the summit, which was so chocked with rime that there was no rock to be seen anywhere, just one giant ball of ice.

The slopes were so mild that for the softness of the snow, it was almost impossible to keep up enough momentum to glissade, so we walked down Avalanche Gulch, step by step. Guy would take one slow step at a time, and about every 10 or 12 steps he would trip and fall over. Luckily the snow was so soft that he didn&#8217;t slide anywhere, so the descent was more of a tiring nuisance for us both rather than any real hazard.<br><br>As the sun began to set, I looked at our pace and guesstimated that if things didn&#8217;t speed up, it would probably take us until about 5 am to reach the car. That prospect really sucked. As we had been on the go for nearly 20 hours, and awake for about 35 hours, we were really dragging. Both of us had run out of water and were famished. As I counted the calories of the food I had eaten on the climb, I realized that though I had consumed 800 calories for the climb, that was 800 calories since the night before! I was hitting the wall hard and mild hallucinations were beginning to creep in.<br><br>I had gotten ahead of Guy and as I waited for him to catch up, I saw a person in yellow following closely behind him. That was strange since I hadn&#8217;t seen anyone as I descended. This person followed Guy closely, but sometimes he would get further away or move in different directions. I knew it was a hallucination, probably from the blurred pattern of the color of his jacket seen without my glasses, but I couldn&#8217;t shake the image no matter how much I squinted, closed eyes, or looked away. This was the strongest hallucination that I had experienced out of the 3 trips where I had been driven to this level of exhaustion.<br><br>I talked with Guy about our pace and our worries about what Jonathan was thinking as we were overdue from our last cell phone message and our phones had long since died from the cold. Although I didn&#8217;t like the idea of leaving him, we decided that I should run down ahead and let Jonathan know that we were O.K., and maybe see if we could get the Sherriff to open the gate on the road so that we could pick up Guy to save him from further injury. I donned my snowshoes and took off at a jog.<br><br>Bushwacking through the forest at night can be disorienting. Add to that the high contrast of the headlamp, mist from your breath, and impaired vision from not wearing my glasses (they kept fogging over) and the mild hallucinations, and it was quite a trip through the forest. I kept seeing tents, signs on the trees, etc. out of my peripheral vision, but these always turned back into blotches of snow or other patterns when I looked straight at them.  Eventually my altimeter said I was past the elevation of the trailhead, and I realized that the assumption that following the fall line would at least take me to the road.<br><br>Crap!  At least according to my map and compass, if I turned left and headed due east, I would hit the road or the ridge descending from Green Butte to Bunny Flat. I turned sharply left, hoping that Guy would still follow my tracks, and took off in a new direction. Soon I reached a steep ridge. Up and over I charged, and soon I had found our tracks from the approach! Shortly thereafter I saw Jonathan&#8217;s headlamp as I neared Bunny Flat. He had gotten worried and had headed up here to find us. He had also brought some food and water. What a savior!<br><br>Jonathan and I were just preparing to head down the road when I saw Guy&#8217;s headlamp not too far off. He had suddenly been making excellent time! It just so happened that by breaking trail with my snowshoes, I had created steps that he could walk in better in his Quasimodo gait, so he was finally moving at a good clip. Even better, he could walk nearly normal on the pavement, so the three of us walked at a moderate pace back to the car.

Despite trees getting in the way near the ridge crest, it was easiest to follow the crest or just west of the crest through the trees where the slope was milder and the snow more wind-scoured.

Although we still had a half hour left to sling the summit before continuing on to get down as planned, I was ready to throw in the towel early in frustration.<br><br>Luckily for me, Vitaliy meant what he said in that he doesn&#8217;t give up easily, and that he considered himself a good luck charm on trips. Though my bad luck seemed to be winning overall, we were at the summit with plenty of time, and the weather today was perfect. We tried a lot of ideas, and just as I was about to give up, Vitaliy suggested one last way to try throwing the rope, which worked surprisingly well. There was a tense moment with each throw as the rope almost seemed to sail true, before bouncing and rolling off. At last, as we tossed the rope and held our breath, the rope finally landed cleanly around the summit block &#8211; and stayed!<br><br>I quickly set up the anchors and then spent another good getting over my nervousness in climbing the rope. The more I got on the thing, the more I could see how nasty a fall would be even with a belay and the more easily I could imagine how things could go wrong. It didn&#8217;t help that the rope was slung a little low, but what could you do?<br><br>As in the famous SP photo, I did the &#8220;Bob Burd&#8221; stem across to the summit block, and half-aided on the rope, while using my left hand and foot to pull on and step around the crest to fight the tendency of the rope to pull me to the right across the summit block. Soon I was high enough that I left my attachment to the rope as a backup and scrambled the rest of the way to the top.',27863,NULL),(30125,920,76,NULL,NULL,NULL,27864,NULL),(30126,920,77,3,'Links',NULL,NULL,NULL),(30127,921,0,2,'2004 Sierra Challenge - Day 5: Mt Haeckel &amp; Mt Wallace',NULL,NULL,NULL),(30128,921,1,3,'August 4th, 2004','<font color=\"BLUE\"><u><b>Stats</b></u></font><br /><b>Routes:</b> <a href=\"http://www.summitpost.org/show/route_link.pl/route_id/4185/object_id/1347\">East Ridge</a>, <a href=\"http://www.summitpost.org/show/route_link.pl/route_id/4295/object_id/3981\">South Ridge</a>, <a href=\"http://www.summitpost.org/show/route_link.pl/route_id/4839/object_id/3981\">Southeast Slopes</a><br /><br /><b>Elevation Gained:</b> 4,200\'<br /><br /><b>RT Distance:</b> 16 mi<br /><br /><b>RT Time:</b> 10hr<br /><br /><b>Trailhead:</b> Lake Sabrina<br /><br /><b>Summit Elevs.:</b> Mt.

I was the unfortunate one to be involved in that accident.<br><br>Bob and Michael were ahead of me again as I descended the slopes. I didn&#8217;t know at what point they descended, so I gradually descended as I traversed south along the bowl at the top of the Southeast Slopes. The terrain was an odd mixture of loose sand and scree, with a lot of medium and large rocks scattered about in this shifting matrix.

Suddenly I was sliding down the hill on a cushion of rocks. A patch about 20 ft by 20 ft around me suddenly let loose. Before I knew what was happening several suitcase-size rocks drifted together around my ankle, pinning me into the slide. As I began to accelerate I managed to grab onto a large boulder as I passed and held onto it for my life. Luckily I was pried free from the clutches of the larger rocks in the slide, and it swept past me with a deafening roar. By this point the rocks had picked up enough speed that the large blocks that had imprisoned me were ricocheting off of the walls of the chute below, setting off slide after slide.<br><br>&#8220;Rock!

The rocks just kept pouring and soon I couldn&#8217;t see the valley below as the dust from the rock fall began to rise up. An updraft blew the dust back up the slope and a wall of dust rose past me.

Luckily Bob and Michael had gotten onto some subtle ridges on the slope and were out of the line of fire.<br><br>Needless to say I descended the rest of the slopes much more carefully. Each time a section of the slope began to give way I stopped my movement, paranoid of starting another large rock fall. Near the bottom of the slope I passed a couple of feet away from a rock the size of a hamper, and my disturbance of the soil supporting it caused it to roll toward me. I pushed back in vain as I tried to jump out of the way, and it rolled over my foot. After a few anguished howls, enough feeling returned to my foot to tell whether or not it was broken. Luckily the soil beneath my foot was soft enough to have protected my foot, so I limped on down the slope.<br><br>By the time I reached the safety of flatter ground and was nearing Moonlight Lake I realized that Michael and Bob were far ahead of me. I also realized that I had no idea how far behind me Matthew was, and I really didn&#8217;t like the idea of waiting a long time at the trailhead for him to get down. Food, drinks, and a shower were just too appealing to wait for possibly another hour to have. I HAD to catch up with Bob and Michael before they left me to such a fate! I picked up the pace and once I was back on the trail I began jogging. I jogged on the down hills and some of the flat ground, and I hiked like a madman up the occasional hill. I figured that they were heading downhill at a fast 3 mph and had perhaps a half hour head start on me &#8211; I had my work cut out for me.<br><br>Despite my fatigue I pressed on as fast as I could. As I neared Dingleberry Lake I passed the volunteer trail maintenance crew again and inquired as to whether they had seen Bob and Michael. They said that they had seen the pair about 10 minutes earlier, so that meant that they were still probably another 20 minutes ahead of me &#8211; I&#8217;d better pick up the pace!<br><br>I ran down the trail, moving as fast as my feet would carry me.

I was nearing Lake Sabrina when I had them down to about 10 minutes ahead of me. I had no idea if they would wait one minute for me at the trailhead, so time was running short.

The day&#8217;s challengers for climbing Mt Winchell&#8217;s East Ridge were Bob, Michael, Matthew, Joe, Michelle, and me. Some of the others had planned on having an easier day and were climbing nearby Mt Agassiz from a different trailhead. <br><br>We started out hiking with headlamps, but hardly a half hour went by before we had enough morning glow from the rising sun to dispense with them. We quickly covered the first set of switchbacks climbing into the north fork and were across the following flats and up the tedious broad switchbacks in no time. I was familiar with this approach as I had climbed 14,000 ft Mt Sill nearly a year earlier with Dirk Summers and Joe Wilson. Last time we hauled in heavy packs laden with climbing gear to attempt the 5.8 Swiss Arete, and we spent a full day on the approach, camping in Sam Mack Meadow. This time I was breezing along the trail with barely 25 lbs in my daypack.<br><br>I was amazed at the comparative difference in progress we made. What had before seemed like a long approach was merely a short stroll along a shaded creek, with barely a glimpse of First, Second, and Third Lakes. Bob, Michelle, and Joe had fallen behind and Matthew had disappeared in the lead, while Michael and I hiked together. We left the main trail just above Third Lake and crossed a marsh before hiking up the final set of switchbacks to gain Sam Mack Meadow.<br><br>The meadow was really a ½ mile deep box-shaped notch cut dramatically into the granite cliffs below the Palisade Glacier. The flatness of the lush green ground was a striking contrast to the bare vertical palisades of crystalline granite surrounding the meadow &#8211; it was definitely one of the most beautiful base camps that I had the privilege to stay in when I was last here.<br><br>Matthew had reached the meadow about 10 minutes before me and Michael, and we regrouped and took a short food and water break while we waited for Bob to catch up. About 5 minutes later he arrived, but Joe and Michelle were nowhere to be seen. Apparently Michelle had been suffering on and off from a knee injury during the trip and had to slow down. Joe stayed with her.<br><br>Next was the problem of getting out of the meadow, which unexpectedly turned out to be the crux of the route. A cascade cut through the cliffs on the northwest end, and we scrambled up the talus and boulders along the side of the stream. This drainage had been in shade enough that it was covered in a thick layer of snow undercut by the stream. This large tongue of snow kept us on the right side of the stream. Suddenly we got to a point where the rocks were completely covered in a thin veneer of verglass. They had been drenched from the spraying water and there was not one patch that had not been iced over.<br><br>After searching around for an ice free way, I decided to just climb up the verglass &#8211; I carefully wedged my feet in the interstices of the rocks to prevent them from slipping out and climbed to the left of a large boulder, right into the spray of the stream. Soon I was through the icy section, and my hands were drenched and cold. Luckily I hadn&#8217;t gotten too wet.

Once again I felt like I was in southern Utah again, familiar territory. Rather than give up my lead, I whipped out the topo map that I brought along, referenced it visually with the slabs, ledges, and cliffs all around, and chose a route. After many years scrambling in similar terrain in the southwest, I had an intuitive grasp of how the rock would go, where to go to stay above the rough boulders in the stream bed without getting cliffed out on the slabs above.<br><br>I took off up a ramp to the left. I kept my eyes peeled and found a nice series of slabs that took me over to an unnamed lake at 11,800 ft with little elevation gain or loss. I circled around the south and west sides before scrambling up the unpleasantly loose moraine of the Thunderbolt Glacier. At about this time Bob, Michael, and Matthew reached the outlet of the lake.

The class 1-2 slabs soon turned to mild class 3 as we climbed higher. After ascending about 1,000 feet we reached a large bowl to the left of the ridge. This bowl provided an easier bypass around some of the more rugged parts of the ridge near the top, so we began climbing the stepped ledges contouring the slope.

In later conversation in Big Pine that night we learned that the others summitted about an hour later in the day). As we rested our legs and enjoyed the view I read through the summit register. One entry that got my attention was one made in memory of a climber who had been killed climbing on Mt Winchell a year earlier.

It looked like a rather nice way up the mountain, and since I had planned on climbing it within the next year or so, I mentally filed this route away as I scoped it out from our high vantage point.<br><br>As we headed down Michael soon left me and Matthew behind. As we neared Sam Mack Meadow I wasn&#8217;t too happy about down climbing the icy rock that we had come up, and I had remembered spying a possible break in the cliffs just south of where we exited the meadows, so on our descent we stayed on a ridge to the south of where we had come up. The terrain continued to slope away from beneath us, but we always seemed to find a route down through the ledges. The final 20 ft was a mildly exposed class 3-4 down climb over a couple of ledges before reaching the flat ground of the meadows.

Or perhaps the trips could help me be at ease with scaling down my career ambitions for the sake of the mountains. For June I would spend the month in Alaska, climbing Denali with a group of climbing friends on a self-led expedition. With this trip already set in stone, I decided to take the month of July &#8220;off&#8221; to &#8220;rest&#8221; and recover from Denali and get in good cycling shape for my next big summer objective: cycling across Western Canada.<br><br>Cycling has always been very therapeutic for me, both physical and emotional, so I guess part of the idea of this trip was to be a symbolic therapy for my current angst about my future.',NULL,NULL),(30344,928,5,3,'The Trip','I first got the idea of doing a cycling trip in the Banff/Jasper area in 1999 when I took a road trip through the area with my father.

The region left a strong impression on me &#8211; some details in particular were the great combination of extremely rugged roadside beauty and surprisingly mild road grades through the mountains, perfect conditions for a great cycle touring route.

First, the trip wouldn&#8217;t just be about cycling in the area. I would also hike and scramble up peaks. I was confident that if I paced myself, I could go continuously for many days, and that the effort of doing day hikes in the Canadian Rockies wouldn&#8217;t tire me out too much for such a pace. Also, I theorized that hiking days could be &#8220;rest&#8221; days for my cycling days, and vice-versa, since the activities use slightly different muscles.<br><br>Then I just went off the deep end. I had always wanted to see Vancouver and had been learning more about Whistler and the Vancouver area, so I began to get interested in linking up my cycling trip from Calgary all the way to Vancouver. I had the time, so what the hell &#8211; if only cycled 50 miles a day, taking all day if I wanted to, I would have time to do this. And so the idea for my uber-ambitious mega-cycling-climbing trip was born.',28061,NULL),(30347,928,8,3,'Partners, Planning, and Preparation','Still, the idea was a little crazy since at the time 50 miles was my all-time cycling record for one day, on an unloaded bike, and it left me wasted for a few days after. Also, I wasn&#8217;t about to do this alone just yet. I had never solo-toured before (or done a cycling tour for that matter), and I had done very little soloing in the mountains.<br><br>For the partner problem, I knew just who to call &#8211; my friend Joel Wilson, who had joined me for the <a href=\"http://www.markpthomas.com/mountaineering/trip-reports/wyoming/gannett-peak-the-hard-way-in-one-day\">Gannett Peak day hike sufferfest</a>. He likes these sorts of trips, and he was very interested in the idea. Still, he had research to do that summer, but expected to be able to take at least a week off. So we tentatively planned for him to join me at the very least in the Banff area. This allowed the nice possibility of trying to climb Mt Assiniboine along the way, since we could afford to bring the weight of a rope and light rack on our bikes as Joel wouldn&#8217;t need to carry as much gear for the trip and wouldn&#8217;t be riding as far with it.<br><br>Sadly, in the end Joel couldn&#8217;t take enough time off to do the whole trip, and then he got a girlfriend, so I was left friendless for the trip.

And my newly purchased SPOT Personal Locator Beacon could be used to let family know on a regular basis whether I was making progress on my route, so at least someone could call in a rescue if I needed one.<br><br>I would fly to Calgary with my bike packed up in a box. Then I would assemble it at the airport and begin my ride. In Vancouver I would get another box to pack up my bike, and ride a Greyhound bus to Seattle to meet some friends and visit a prospective employer before shipping my bike back to Salt Lake City flying back to school in Berkeley via Los Angeles (for further job interviews). Busy month! Plus there was still the possibility of my friends in Seattle driving up to meet me in Whistler with extra climbing gear to tackle Mt Garabaldi.',28062,NULL),(30348,928,9,NULL,NULL,'For planning and preparations, I made good use of the month of July staying at home in Salt Lake City. The planning was a major hurdle in and of itself. I had absolutely no idea what I was really getting into, and I couldn&#8217;t find any information readily available for doing such a cycling tour, as far as where to stay, quality of roads, suggested routes, distances to be covered each day, where to restock on food and water, etc.<br><br>That and I needed to learn how to do a multi-day cycling tour. So I designed a custom trip from scratch based on internet searches, point of personal interest, and the joys of Google Maps and Google Earth. A few variations were planned, all of which passed handily through Kamloops, making a figure-8 centered on the town. I was very tempted with a northern route via Jasper and then down the backside of the Canadian Rockies. But then that was a major detour, and I would miss Yoho National Park, which I had yet to see. So I would take Canada Highway 1 from Calgary to Kamloops.<br><br>On the next leg, the more obvious route was to join Highway 5 and take it south and into the river valley that empties into Vancouver. This way is more well-traveled, but from what I read online, the there was a pass that was notorious for cycling tourists for its steepness and elevation gain from either side; plus, the idea of cycling through endless flat land and suburbs to get to Vancouver seemed less appealing to me.<br><br>By looking closely at maps, I picked together a northern route that took me to Cache Creek, over the Pavilion Range to Lillooete, and then over the Coastal Range in 2 hurdles, one from Lillooet to Pemberton, and then another main climb from Pemberton to Whistler. From there it was (mostly) downhill to Vancouver on the vividly-named Sea-to-Sky Highway. The idea of descending from the mountains to the ocean, cycling along a highway like California&#8217;s Highway 1, sandwiched between the mountains and the sea seemed too great to pass up. Plus, this route brought me in to Vancouver from the north, allowing me to get downtown with a minimum of cycling within the city.',28063,NULL),(30349,928,10,NULL,NULL,'There was a big problem with the alternate route, though. Upon closer inspection, the stretch from Lillooet to Pemberton seemed to fade away.  Topographic maps showed a nice valley linking the two towns, but this was filled with a reservoir and I could only find railroad tracks alongside the water. There was a road (that as far as I could tell from satellite photos was paved) that cut across the arc that the valley carved through the mountains, but this shortcut had a significant climb up and over the mountains. In addition to climbing over 3,000 ft in one push, I found the first 1,500 ft to be very steep &#8211; grades as steep as 10% and nothing less than 5%. This would not be pretty with a fully loaded touring bike at the end of a major cycling tour. I had no idea if I could even peddle up such a consistently steep grade with so much weight on my bike. Still, the picturesque descent on the Sea-to-Sky Highway ending with a sudden and dramatic entrance into Vancouver (similar to entering San Francisco via the Golden Gate Bridge) seemed too romantic of an idea to pass up. So it was settled.<br><br>My dad insisted that I was going backwards on the route, since it was against the prevailing wind, but I was set on having Vancouver as the endpoint. It seemed more rewarding and a much nicer way to end the trip by arriving someplace new. Also, research into typical wind weather data for August in the towns I was riding through showed that the winds were primarily directed by the mountains and not the prevailing current. Regardless which way I traveled, I would have headwind about half the time, tail wind the other half, and some cross-wind here and there.',28064,NULL),(30350,928,11,NULL,NULL,'With the route known, I then digitized the route (nerdy, I know, but helpful). Not only could I plan were I should stop based on distance and elevation gain, but I could have a breakdown printed out with me to know how much distance and elevation gain between various points, which proved very helpful in the trip when I had to deviate from my planned stops (which happened a lot!) and I wanted to make informed decisions. Because there were a lot of ways in which I could break up the route, by having the map digitized on a spread sheet, I could intelligently plan stops so that I could start small with elevation gain and distance, and gradually ramp it up.<br><br>As far as climbing, I spent hours poring over guidebooks and Google Earth piecing together potential peaks. Eventually I drew up a list of possible outings (more than I could do, but then allowing for a nice variety of options). One logistic to work out was how I would get to the peaks without a car, so finding routes with reasonable cycling approaches was key. I could cycle out from a &#8220;base camp&#8221;, climb a peak, and then head back. On peaks further out, but along my route, I could cycle over, climb the peak, and continue on to that night&#8217;s destination. The second concern was what I would do with the gear and food on my bike, being left unattended in Bear country.<br><br>Light camo- netting would protect my bike from theft (after it was stashed in the bushes, plus the netting could make &#8216;questionable&#8217; roadside camping easier), but were there any bear boxes at the trailheads, or would I have to bring a bear canister? A call to the ranger office in Banff answered that question &#8211; no bear boxes, and the Canadians don&#8217;t trust bear canisters. My only option would be to hang food. I was also informed that I didn&#8217;t need to make campsite reservations as I should be able to find a site coming in on a bicycle and it being a slow year. When the ranger inquired as to my overall plans and I told him, he warned me that the stretch from around Kamloops all the way to the Coastal Range was a desert that could reach 100<sup>o</sup> F during August. I had seen the barren areas on satellite photos, but just assumed it was barren and cool highlands &#8211; I hadn&#8217;t even considered that rain-drenched British Columbia would have a desert! I would have to get across that section of my route fast &#8211; and carry a lot of water.<br><br>In order to prep myself for the trip while trying to recover from Denali, I tried to cycle at least every other day, if not every day, for the entire month &#8211; and when I went out I aimed to punish myself. The emphasis would be hills galore, and as fast as I could take them. Of course I would also make sure my rides were initially at least 20 miles and then gradually increase the distance to 50 miles or so. The 10-mile 2,000 ft climb in Millcreek Canyon got routine and loops from my house in Holladay to Brighton and Alta ski resorts became reasonable outings.<br><br>Packing went less straightforward. By the time I had amassed all of the gear I thought I needed, it weighed over 90 lbs. After some thoughtful sorting and inventorying to see where the weight was, I managed to trim it down to 82 lbs &#8211; still not a very good number, but it was the best I could do with the unknowns. Spread-sheeting everything, as nerdy as it seemed at the time, was very helpful, since I could make sure the weight was balanced well between my 4 panniers and rear bag. Also, bringing a printout list with me made repacking every day very easy, since everything was packed so tightly and needed to stay balanced throughout the trip.',28065,NULL),(30351,928,12,NULL,NULL,'In the end I decided to go without a trailer (harder to control on downhills, and required more parts to bring for repairs) in favor of front panniers (messes with steering a tad, but otherwise lighter and simpler for airline travel), and going by what apparently is a North American preference of 70% weight on the rear and 30% weight on the front.  Also, I chose my mountain bike, outfitted with slicks, over my lighter and faster road bike. The name of the game on this ride would be comfort, and I needed as low of a gear as possible for the &#8216;death pass&#8217; near Lillooete.',NULL,NULL),(30352,928,13,3,'Day 0 - Test Run','Planning and packing took much longer than expected, and my procrastination for actually loading up my bike and riding with it stretched until the day before my flight to Calgary. I planned to load it up exactly as I would ride, including wearing my climbing daypack carrying a full camelback of water, and then cycle from my house to the top of Immigration Canyon and back.This would give me a nice continuous 1,500 ft climb on grades similar to anything I expected to experience on the route except for the &#8216;death pass&#8217;.<br><br>The first run didn&#8217;t go so well, as it was very difficult controlling the bicycle, with extremely bad fluttering in the rear, especially whenever I turned. Moving weight lower solved this problem, and I was on my way.<br><br>Overall the ride was fine once I got used to the sluggish handling and riding slower. I knew I would need to practice self-discipline in focusing on perceived effort and not speed as my pace metric for the trip so that I wouldn&#8217;t burn myself out. The riding wasn&#8217;t too bad with the weight on my bike as long as I didn&#8217;t try to go fast, and to my surprise, I made the climb without it being that bad. In fact, I still managed to pass some cyclists on the climb.<br><br>Everything went fine until I got home. I hit the driveway a little fast, which has a sudden uphill slope from the road, and this dynamic shock caused my rear pannier rack to shear off the mounting screws. All I felt was a bump, and then there was a sudden snap as it felt like I just started tugging a block of concrete, stopping me cold. I went out for some last minute errands, including getting some stronger metal grade screws, and extra screws and other supplies.<br><br>Because the screw sheared off, half of the screw was still wound into the threads on my bike frame, and only after drilling a griping hole to unscrew this segment with some special tools was the bike mechanic able to free the hole for the replacement screw. There was no way I would be able to carry the tools needed to fix such a breakdown if this happened again on route, so if the screws sheared off while on my ride, I would have no way to remount the rack. I would have to be very careful on my trip to avoid this type of breakdown, especially since hitting holes and bumps at speed would be unavoidable on the trip. I made a note to always check the mounting screws before and after each ride and retighten them if they came loose to avoid subjecting them to an extra dynamic shock from any bumps.<br>As much as I had hoped to be better prepared, I was out of time, and things seemed to barely be ready enough to go through with the trip.

The idea was better in theory than in practice - a whining infant on the flight helped give me a 24-hour sleep deficit before starting my ride.<br><br>I touched down sometime around 5:30 am. I had carried two of my panniers, full, onto the airplane, and everything else was neatly packed inside my bike box or my Andanista Wild Things mountaineering pack, which were picked up without incident at the baggage claim.

I set up shop on the loading/unloading curb of the terminal, unpacking all of my bags and bike frame from the box, and I spent the next hour and a half repacking things for the ride and assembling my bike. Pumping the mountain bike tires with a hand pump was very trying, and something I really hoped I&#8217;d only have to do this once. Assembling the front rack with my small, awkward multi-tools was also tedious. At least I was providing entertainment for the Pakistani taxi drivers that had begun to gather around my scene, taking an interest in the mess. Naturally, they all thought I was crazy.',28067,NULL),(30357,929,3,NULL,NULL,'By 7:30 I was set up and cycling my way out of the airport terminal and on the frontage road towards Calgary. The morning was amazingly clear, and it was surreal and somewhat intimidating to see downtown Calgary in the distance, and the Rocky Mountains, still further away, rising high above the Great Plains. I felt more than a little intimidated. This was my first trip to a foreign country completely alone with no one waiting for me (as foreign as Canada is), and the plans for my first day seemed huge. Biking all the way across Calgary as just a warm up seemed a large task. I felt a tad vulnerable and exposed. Could I really make it all the way to Canmore? What was I getting myself into? Well, I was finally committed, and this added to the suspense.<br><br>Once I got into a good cycling rhythm, I forgot about my worries and began enjoying the experience. I was gradually getting used to handling my bike with its heavy load, which was a good thing since I was about to experience my next challenge - Canada&#8217;s ambiguous freeway system.  My understanding (Canadians, please correct me if I&#8217;m wrong) is that many of the freeways in Canada are distinctly different than U.S. freeways in that they aren&#8217;t limited access. Basically, large boulevards eventually had overpasses, underpasses, and onramps built onto them, and most of these routes still allowed pedestrians and cyclists. Plus, there wasn&#8217;t much of a good alternative route left once these boulevards had been converted.',28068,NULL),(30358,929,4,NULL,NULL,'So with the high rise buildings of Calgary looming large, I found my way onto the &#8220;freeway&#8221;, hugging the right shoulder as much as I could. I could really feel the wind from passing vehicles, not only from their size, velocity, and proximity, but also because with all of my gear, my bike had a lot more surface area to catch the side wind. As I approached the river crossing on my route through the downtown, it appeared I had no option but to go up the highway bridge that arced over the water.  This felt sooo wrong, both because the shoulder got a lot smaller (although I still was able to stay out of the traffic lanes), and also the feeling of cycling on a narrow overpass felt like it should be illegal (anywhere in the U.S. it sure would be). I sprinted on this part to get it over with as fast as possible, and soon I was spit out onto the downtown streets and onto the riverside promenade.',28069,NULL),(30359,929,5,NULL,NULL,'The promenade offered both a very nice way to see some scenic parts of Calgary and a clear through-way through much of the city with no cars to contend with &#8211; only early morning joggers and skaters.

What I hadn&#8217;t counted on was how much the terrain could roll at just a low enough relief that I missed it on my topo-map survey.

Sustainability is key here, not time. If you feel like you are working hard, ease up or lighten the gear. Eventually you will get to where you are going.

On an unloaded bicycle on most roads, these are just intimidating nuisances, but when they are moving at high speeds, the turbulence they kick up really packs a punch, especially on a touring rig. First, a front wave of compressed air being driven forward by the vehicle hits you, knocking you forward and then away from the vehicle as it passes you. Then you enter the low-pressure suction zone behind this wave, which sucks you sideways towards the vehicle.<br><br>Finally, there is the rear suction of the vehicle, which smacks you from behind again as the vehicle passes. This whole dance of wind forces plays out in about 0.5-1 seconds and with a touring rig it was strong enough to cause a crash. You have to counter lean and steer, while controlling the inertia of the touring rig as it inevitable just moving side to side. This was even the case when I was 5 or 6 feet away on the shoulder. Even passing RVs could cause a crash from a moment of carelessness.',28071,NULL),(30361,929,7,NULL,NULL,'Another unexpected hazard is the constant encounter with small cracks, holes, and debris on the shoulder. Such small hazards cannot be seen from far away and are invisible to cars.

Between the road surface hazards, and vehicle hazards, cycling was not something that could be done carelessly. Constant attention had to be paid with lots of reacting.

Today, my first day of the tour, I cycled 97 miles with around 80 lbs on my bike!<br><br>With no campsite reserved, and a desire to avoid the high price for a spot, I cruised the campground looking for some people willing to share a site. One benefit of touring solo is that it is much easier to do this if you&#8217;re alone. In no time I found a campsite that was being jointly shared by a number of solo and paired adventurers who were happy to have me as company. Technically there were too many people on the site, but we agreed I would sleep in my bivvy sack just over the hill crest and pack it up each morning so that it wasn&#8217;t obvious how many people were sleeping at the site.

At one point I stopped in at the ranger station to get some info on a possible day hike. Right before I left on my trip, my dad strongly recommended that I try to find my way into an area in Yoho National Park called Lake O&#8217;Hara. The lake was 10 miles away from the highway, but the road was closed to cars and bikes. The only way to get there was to hike, or take a reserved shuttle. Reservations often needed to be made weeks in advance. Once up there, the only camping available was available only by reservation 6 months in advance, and it usually filled up 6 months in advance. This makes the area relatively inaccessible to most people, but my dad suggested that I still try to find a way to get in there.<br><br>Hiking 20 miles on dirt road just to get to and from the Lake seemed like a raw deal, so I was considering hiking over the continental divide on a 20-30 mile day hike, but which route? My dad was certain that you could hike up to the Abbot Mountain Hut from Lake Louise, but from what I could tell from topo maps and Google Earth, this looked very unlikely. The ranger I spoke with said this way was not advisable since the canyon headwall to gain Abbot Mountain Hut from the East was called &#8220;The Death Trap&#8221;, as it was about 60-degree alpine ice, heavily crevassed, corniced, and within range of the regular rock and snow slides pouring off of Mt Victoria. I had another route in mind via Moraine Lake, but according to the rangers, this also required travel on a glacier that I would not want to do solo.<br><br>However, I was in luck.  While the ranger was trying to discourage me from attempting to day hike to Lake O&#8217;Hara solo, a reservation at the Lake O&#8217;Hara campground was canceled. The ranger came back to me with an offer to take the site, which I did without hesitation. Based on my plans, I wouldn&#8217;t be finished in Lake Louise by then, but I could always come back before continuing West. The rangers in Yoho would even be nice enough to take my bike up in their pickup truck, despite bicycles not being allowed up there. This was for my bike&#8217;s security, and as long as I wasn&#8217;t caught riding it, they were fine with it up there.<br><br>Just to make sure I understood how to store food properly for some of my en route peak bagging, I checked with the ranger on this. It turned out, after explaining my unique bicycle situation, that this ranger was the one I had spoken to on the phone a few weeks earlier when I was planning the trip! I guess he didn&#8217;t think I would actually go through with the trip when he said I could hang food, just out of sight of the trailhead, because all of a sudden he said I couldn&#8217;t do that. The only option would be to leave food at the campground lockers, forcing me to make my peakbagging plans solely on basing out of campgrounds.<br><br>The ranger repeated the warnings about British Columbia&#8217;s desert but was happy to see that I had since prepared for it.

So I decided to hang around, reading and living off of coffee refills. Hanging out there, alone, in my unusual cycling clothes brought some attention. In addition to the lone man I talked with, I caught the attention of Jacquie, a pretty waitress that was serving me coffee. Gradually over the morning I told her about my trip, and also about my Denali climb (which another co-worker of hers took a great interest in). She was familiar with San Francisco after traveling there for some teaching seminars, was from Easter Canada, but spending her summers working in Banff and getting into the outdoors and vibrant art community there. When I finally decided to leave to avoid taking up too much space, she gave me her card to keep in touch. My, Canadians are friendly!<br><br>The rain had stopped and the sun was peeking out, but the clouds still didn&#8217;t look too friendly.

Still, the day wasn&#8217;t without more surprises. One downside to taking the smaller side road to the main highway was that it followed the landscape more &#8211; lots of winding, which was nice, but there were also no road cuts.<br><br>The road would go pretty flat for a while then hit a ridge coming down from the mountains. Here the road would just angle slightly and climb straight up the steeply at 5-8% grades, dropping just as steeply down the backside as soon as the crest was reached.

The station attendant said Castle Mountain still had space, to which I gave him a look, told him about the ranger in Banff, and also pointed out that I had just cycled from Banff in my fully loaded touring rig, the campground was 10 miles back the way I came, and that sunset was in about 30 minutes. Ergo, this information would be helpful to someone driving in a car, but not to me.

I expected an easy, straightforward 19 mile ride today &#8211; no tricky business.

I departed with my feet still torn up, swelling up in my shoes, and an ample supply of gallon ziplock bags (my answer to the rain-soaking problem for my shoes).<br><br>Cresting the pass, I was disappointed to find a very strong headwind blowing up the pass. I had expected a fun fast ride down the steep drop to Field, but the winds were so strong that even on a 5% downgrade, I had to pedal hard downhill to barely sustain a 15 mph speed. Midway down the canyon I stopped at an excellent overlook of one of the more interesting sections of the transcontinental railroad, where two spiral tunnels had been built in a figure-8 linkup into the mountainsides to maintain a lower (but still very steep) grade for the train tracks. Before the spiral tunnels had been built, the grade was so steep (4.5%) that it was a common occurrence for trains to become runaway and crash somewhere down the canyon or into Field.

The front blast of pressure from the semi forced me to lean harder into the wind to avoid getting knocked over into the shoulder. Then the suction came, which with the fast flowing cross wind, was itself exaggerated.  The suction came so fast that I didn&#8217;t have a chance to stop leaning towards the semi when suddenly I was sucked very hard towards it. I jerked hard away from the semi to avoid falling into the road just before the tail-wind turbulence and the resumption of the cross-wind hit me, causing me to swerve left and right as I tried to control the weight of my rig while fighting the cross-wind.

Then I could skip the campground in Glacier and cycle all the way to Revelstoke, with further shifts in my plans beyond that.<br><br>As I prepared to leave the campground, I saw another cyclist sitting in the back of his truck, prepping his bike for a ride. Coincidentally, he was from Golden and had driven out here to cycle back for a good ride. He gave me some helpful beta for the day&#8217;s ride, and for the road beyond Golden &#8211; luckily everything sounded pretty hunky-dory to me. He even gave me an excellent recommendation for breakfast in Field &#8211; the Stuffed Pig.',28205,NULL),(30499,931,9,NULL,NULL,'I found the Stuffed Pig easily enough, and feeling weak and famished (probably not eating enough calories), attempted to stuff myself like a pig while enjoying the breathtaking north face of Mt Stephen rising 6,000 ft nearly straight above the town. While eating brunch, my conspicuous getup sparked another conversation with a fellow traveler. The guy looked like just your run-of-the mill baby-boomer tourist, but apparently the guy had done extensive distance cycling in Europe in his younger years. I told him about my plans, and we had a nice chat about his cycling past. It&#8217;s interesting to see the type of connections you bridge with strangers when traveling alone and conspicuously (e.g. decked out in climbing gear, or cycling gear, etc.) &#8211; experiences that would have been missed in any other circumstance.<br><br>After I could eat no more, I continued on my way down the flat river plains of Yoho. Gradually, the mountains receded behind me, and the temperature began to rise. About an hour into the ride, I reached my first road construction zone, which turned out to be surprisingly pleasant. As traffic was stopped for alternate 1-way travel, I cycled past the long long line of cars and passengers lounging on the roadside until I reached the front of the line (hehe). The roadworker there was very chatty, pointing out various landmarks of the peaks and glaciers nearby. She was even nice enough to give me a few minutes head start through the construction zone before unleashing the rest of the traffic!<br><br>As I left the Rockies behind, my thermometer continued to climb. I kept it shaded, but still I recorded a (very brief) high of 104<sup>o</sup> F that day (perhaps due to the road radiating heat?), and I felt more than a little feint and nauseas at time. Luckily I had plenty of water! Also, today there were still high headwinds that made the net downhill ride harder than expected, but at least it gave me occasional reprieve from the heat.',28206,NULL),(30500,931,10,NULL,NULL,NULL,28207,NULL),(30501,931,11,NULL,NULL,'As I neared Golden the road enters a deep, rugged canyon.

I also checked the latest weather forecast. It didn&#8217;t look good &#8211; a 50% chance of slight rain tomorrow. I wanted to avoid rain, especially when crossing Roger&#8217;s Pass and the avalanche tunnels en route. However, the forecast for Glacier called for only a 50% of scattered showers, with 1-2mm of precipitation &#8211; not too bad. Plus, throughout my time in the Canadian Rockies, nearly every day that rain was forecast turned out to be sunny (and vice-versa), so I had begun to take the forecasts more casually. I decided I would just see how the weather looked tomorrow, and if it wasn&#8217;t too bad, to attempt my 90-mile ride to Revelstoke while keeping a close eye on the weather.<br><br>After deciding what to do the next day, I checked in at the R.V. camp, set up my bivvy next to some interesting Swiss motorcyclists, and rejoiced as I did my first load of laundry for the trip (imagine lasting 11 incredibly sweaty days with only 2 shirts and 2 shorts!).<br><br>With a mind towards packing in more calories to prepare for the much longer day tomorrow (and the first real crux, surmounting Roger&#8217;s Pass), I walked over to a neighboring hotel just as rain started to fall. There I ate steak and drank good tap beer at the hotel bar. While eating, I met two Hollanders (different ones) who were traveling across Western Canada in an R.V. They had remembered me from the road earlier that day, and the Hollanders joked that if they saw me the next day as they drove over Roger&#8217;s Pass, they would tempt me with an offer for a ride over the pass to Revelstoke.<br><br>After a filling dinner, I retired to my freshly rain-soaked bivvy and enjoyed a good book before turning in for the night.',28208,NULL),(30502,931,12,3,'Day 12 &#8211; Bad Decisions &amp; Bad Weather - <b><i>Golden to Revelstoke</i></b>',NULL,28209,NULL),(30503,931,13,NULL,NULL,'<b><u>By Bike:</u></b><br />Distance: 65.7 miles<br /><br />Elevation Gain: 4,050 ft<br />Today I awoke to uncertain weather. Looking to the north the sky was clear. To the south was somewhat mixed, but not too threatening. Meanwhile a valley fog was still rolling in bands across the landscape, but was sure to dissipate soon. Well, the weather wasn&#8217;t wonderful, but it wasn&#8217;t terrible either. I took my time eating an ample breakfast at the motel, and the fog had already started to burn off by the time I hit the road.',28210,NULL),(30504,931,14,NULL,NULL,'I had been experiencing a lingering and growing fatigue since the start of my trip. I hadn&#8217;t experienced any DOMS (delayed onset muscle fatigue), nor or other soreness on most days, and the fatigue didn&#8217;t feel like I was tiring myself out during the day. It was more of an underlying fatigue, occasionally leaving me spacey and lessening morale, but it usually got better whenever I got a chance to gorge myself. I realized that I had absolutely no idea how many calories I should be eating each day, and for the most part had been subsisting off of GU, Cliff Bars, and Peanut butter sandwiches, bagels, and the occasional dinner in town while spending hours a day on a heavily loaded bicycle or hiking for miles and climbing thousands of feet. Also, I wasn&#8217;t eating while on my bicycle.<br><br>I would have to make an effort to consume more calories. Today I strategized two ways to help do this. First, I would pack along Snickers candy bars, since they are much more appetizing and fattening than Cliff Bars. They could also be a good morale booster. Also, both for morale and regular eating, I decided I would experiment with riding the first 30-40 miles of my expected 90-mile ride without break (as usual), but beyond this I would stop every 10 miles to eat a GU or Cliff Bar (ca. every hour), take a good long sip of water from my camelback. Standing and stretching a bit while doing this could help the saddle soreness, back soreness, and hand numbness that inevitably worked up during the long riding days.<br><br>The ride out from Golden was nice and easy, with a short downhill, and then lots of flat terrain with only the occasional small hill. I made excellent time, cruising at a nice fast speed as passed through bands of thick fog and sunny clearings. The first major climbs of the day (and my largest continuous climbs of the trip) passed by fine &#8211; all I had to do was remember to slow down and focus on perceived effort and not on speed or how far I had to go. The fog was finally gone and the weather was mostly clear and sunny, even over the Columbia Range to the West.',28211,NULL),(30505,931,15,NULL,NULL,'I crested the first summit of the day and dropped down the backside into a canyon as I turned south towards Roger&#8217;s Pass.  Just as I passed the entrance to Glacier National Park, storm clouds suddenly began to pour over the crest of the Columbia Range. Rain appeared to be imminent, so when I found a good roadside pullout, I pulled off, wrapped rain covers on my panniers, threw on my rain poncho, and took a beating from the first wave of rain as I stood out in the open, as no meaningful shelter was available. Still, I stayed mostly dry, as did my bike seat and gear. The rain appeared to be a small thunderstorm cell, so I waited for it to pass, and after about 20 minutes the rain had stopped. Another 20 minutes and it was sunny again and the road was dry.<br><br>I had reservations about trying to cycle over Roger&#8217;s Pass now. However, as things stood, I was 40 miles into my ride. Returning to Golden would mean that would have cycled 80 miles that day and would still be a day behind. Plus, I was almost halfway done with the ride, with the crest of Roger&#8217;s Pass only 10 miles away. After that, it would all be downhill from there and a very fast downhill at that.  Plus, base d on the weather forecast, I had received all of the rain I was likely to encounter that day, or at least any more rain should be fairly light. So I decided to go for it.<br><br>So I began the long climb to Roger&#8217;s Pass, which would be my first real test-piece of the cycle tour for how I would handle the dreaded &#8220;death pass&#8221; in the Coastal Range at the end of my trip. From the East, Roger&#8217;s Pass climbs about 2,000 feet continuously over about 8 miles. It got very steep very fast and the grade never let up, but I was insistent on never dropping into my third chain-ring, since I had to reserve that for the &#8220;death pass&#8221; &#8211; if I used if here, I would have much less confidence later.<br><br>About halfway up the pass, the shoulder narrowed and got rough, forcing me to occasionally wander partway over into the road, so I was very attentive with my rear view mirror. The steepness was really getting to me, so after passing a blind turn with a narrow shoulder (yikes!), I pulled across the road to a turnout for a brief break, feeling very glad all the while that I had bothered to mount such a bright and tall safety flag on my bicycle. The grade of the road was so steep that after my brake, I couldn&#8217;t start straight up the road from a standing stop, forcing me to coast downhill and pull a U-turn.<br><br>A bothersome problem was starting to occur that also forced me to resume riding like this. Beginning the day before as I climbed the final headwall into Golden, I noticed that if I stopped on a hill and then attempted to start riding directly up the hill again, my pedals and crankshaft would disengage from chain ring and spin freely until I put my feet down to avoid tipping over. As this started to occur, I could only avoid it on lesser slopes, or if I reduced the starting tension by running the bike uphill first, or coasting downhill first. Then the crankshaft would catch again and I could resume pedaling. If I was lucky, I could get the same effect by briefly slowing my pedaling down, and staring up again slowly before I tipped over. It was a minor but very disturbing irritation that seemed to be getting worse, and was much more noticeable on uphills, making it very troublesome on Roger&#8217;s Pass.',28212,NULL),(30506,931,16,NULL,NULL,'About halfway up the pass, it started raining again, but there was no good place to stop to take cover. It was a light rain, though, and I only had another 5 miles to go until the crest. As soon as I found a slightly wider part of the shoulder, I stopped to put my trusty gallon zip-lock bags over my shoes. With my toes shoved firmly into the toe clips, they stayed on and worked surprisingly well for keeping my feet dry &#8211; at first.  Every now and then I would stop, either from fatigue, or losing my momentum from a swerve around an obstacle on the pavement (the shoulders in B.C. were littered with trash, holes and cracks, as compared to Alberta&#8217;s) or losing my concentration from the one or two cars that honked their horns at me despite me being well off the road at the time and visible plenty far ahead (to me it was obvious that the cars were timing their honks to harass me as this only happened on the straight-aways). Each time it was harder and harder to start again as my pedals disengaged and spun freely, and each time I stopped I managed to lose the zip-locks from one foot or the other, necessitating another stop and using another bag.<br><br>Finally I was nearly at the pass and began to feel relieved. Until I reached my first avalanche shed, that it. Because Roger&#8217;s Pass is so narrow, with steep mountains rising thousands of feet on both sides of the road, the road is extremely vulnerable to avalanches. Also, unlike the canyons in Utah&#8217;s Wasatch Range, no avalanche control work is done out here due to the large distances and small population. Instead, at each avalanche path, a shed is built over the road, creating a tunnel for the road and a bed for the avalanche to slide on, clear of the road.<br><br>The sheds were hundreds of feet long, and on the uphill this took some time to pass through, leaving me unnerved for a while, and pressured to cycle harder than I wanted to in order to speed through them. These sheds had several unanticipated problems for me on a bicycle, too. First, they weren&#8217;t lit. Although I had lots of reflective tape, a reflective flag, and 2 tail lights, I still didn&#8217;t like it. Second, the shoulder got very narrow. And 3rd, the shoulders had small rumble-strips carved into them, making for a bumpy and slow ride. So each tunnel provided a few minutes of hurried cycling and elevated stress before I could slow down and relax. But I only had a handful to pass through before the summit, and I expected no problem breezing through them at 20-25 mph on the downhill.<br><br>At last I reached the pass, where there was a large parking lot and gas station. I ate a full lunch, chugged a Gatorade and wolfed down 2 Snickers Bars, buying more of both for the rest of the ride. By now the rain had stopped, with the clouds clearing again, letting the sun shine brightly down.

And that is when I began to lose control.',28215,NULL),(30509,931,19,NULL,NULL,'As I descended, I rounded a hard corner, and I ran head on into a monster storm that had been lurking out of site behind the turn in the canyon. The sky quickly darkened and I was hit head on by an incredibly strong wind. Despite the slopes at the pass being 5% or greater, I had to cycle as hard as I could to not drop below 10 mph. At some times I was going nearly as slow as 5 mph on the downhill while cranking as hard as I could! As I battled the winds, a downpour started.<br><br>I stopped to put on my zip-lock bags, and had trouble starting again as my pedals spun freely.  I got going, but lost a bag in the process. I realized this a while later and stopped to put on a fresh one. This happened multiple times. The wind blew the rain so hard that despite wearing waterproof shells, the rain was driven through every small opening or lapping of the shell layers, completely soaking me.<br><br>And then I reached the avalanche tunnels. Now they were dark and slick. I discovered on my first tunnel that the shoulder rumble strips, covered with so much water, became very slick, and I began to skid. After nearly crashing into the raised walkway wall, I got off my bike and awkwardly walked on the wall, bending over to walk my bike along the tunnel edge. In the process I lost some more zip-lock bags. After the initial skid, I did this on every tunnel with a raised walkway, often losing zip-locks in the process of walking the bike or attempting to start it again. Eventually I ran out of zip-lock bags and my feet became soaked.<br><br>Now I was soaked from head to toe in freezing rain. Winds were roaring incredibly hard, and I had descended over 5 miles away from and over 500 ft below the pass. Turning around wasn&#8217;t an option. I could have stopped, gotten out my bivvy, and waited out the rain, except the road had few shoulders and rose up or dropped off steeply on both sides. And if I had still been dry this could have seemed more appealing, but as I was already drenched, it seemed a bad idea to stop and let my body cool down in soggy clothes. Also, Revelstoke was all downhill from here, and this rain couldn&#8217;t last that much longer could it? I rationalized that my best bet now was to forge ahead and drop below the worst of the rain as fast as I could rather than digging in for shelter or turning back. This didn&#8217;t work out, but even now it isn&#8217;t clear to me which of the 3 options would have been the most dangerous at that point.<br><br>Finally, about halfway down to Revelstoke from the pass, only 25 miles from safety, I walked my bike through an avalanche shed, only to find that I couldn&#8217;t get the pedals to engage again. I tried and tried, and nothing happened. Now I was stuck on a roadside shoulder between two avalanche tunnels with no shelter and nowhere to go. I began to get really angry, frustrated, and frightened at this point as the bike failed to start. As I began to despair, a van passed by, slowed down, and pulled over onto the shoulder.<br><br>I ran over to the van with my bike as fast as I could.<br><br>&#8220;Hi,&#8221; the driver with an Italian accent said, &#8220;my name is Louie. Do you need a ride?&#8221;<br><br>The timing couldn&#8217;t have been better. I threw my bike into the back of the van and jumped into the warm, dry shelter of the front passenger seat as Louie started down the road again. He was heading to Revelstoke too, for work with an outdoor guiding group. He said he had done a fair share of cycle touring in Tuscany, and having experienced some nasty rainstorms there, and empathizing with my situation, took pity on me when he saw me in my sad state alongside the road.<br><br>As I decompressed from the adrenaline rush and frigid wet cold, I watched the canyon go by. It was disappointing and also strange to suddenly be riding in a vehicle, passing effortlessly and quickly through terrain I had expected to work my way through on two wheels. But still, Louie was a LIFE SAVER.<br><br>Down in Revelstoke, the town was wet from rain, but only mildly so. The clouds were clearing again, and it appeared the town had been going through this cycle all day, but in a much milder form than what I had experienced up higher. Louie was so great that he took me straight to where I planned to stay for the night, the SameSun Hostel.

As Marble Canyon was in a Provincial Park, there was a ranger there, Connie, who showed me to a good campsite and struck up a nice conversation.

I used to be deathly afraid of heights.<br />I still am, sort of, but I&#8217;ve learned to work with it.<br />My father believes it stems from my premature attempt at toddler free-soloing during a trip to Lake Powell, which left me perched on a ledge well below the top of the sandstone escarpment but above a 50-100 ft clean drop into deep water. The exposure was bad enough that he was scared down climbing to me and he had nightmares for a while after the rescue. No one had any idea how I had gotten in such a precarious position, and if it hadn&#8217;t been for luck and a passing motorboat seeing me &amp; reporting me to my parents, who knows what would have happened?<br />As a child I would freak out and cry when we would be driving on a road alongside a steep drop (like the ones along roadsides in Great Basin National Park), though airplanes didn&#8217;t scare me unless we were taking off or landing. Technically it wasn&#8217;t heights that scared me &#8211; it was &#8216;exposure&#8217;. Airplanes were manageable, but nothing was more terrifying to me than the idea of being out on a big open face with a view straight down the fall line. No one would have expected me to get into mountaineering, rock climbing, or, especially, big wall climbing.<br />During a winter descent into a canyon in the San Rafael Swell as a Boy Scout, we had to rappel to get past cliffs and snow covered slabs. It was there that I first realized that when I was connected into a safety system, although I was still frightened, I could take that fear and &#8216;set it aside&#8217;, so to speak, and focus on the task at hand.

First, the entire length of the highway from Whistler to Vancouver was essentially one long construction zone in preparation for the upcoming Winter Olympics. Second, the road before the construction had very tight turns and bad shoulders. Apparently enough cyclists are hit by drivers rushing between Whistler and Vancouver that some people call the highway the &#8220;Sea-to-Die Highway&#8221;. On top of that, the forecast was for rain in 2 days, which could possibly break while I am en route to Vancouver.<br><br>Upon hearing my debate on what to do, one of the guests in the hostel strongly warned me not to do it. He was driving a van for hire and was already taking some clients into the city today. I could play it safe and join him.

Also, it seemed a real shame to have come all this way only to stop short of reaching Vancouver, or even the West Coast.<br><br>M.C. helped me out here, suggesting that I could at least cycle to Squamish, and if the weather got bad or construction was too bad, I could then bus the last stretch along the coast. As to my reservations about the highway, a lot of the judgments I had heard were second-hand and casual observations from drivers and not cyclists. Yes, it could be dangerous, but was it really any worse than many of the miles I had already cycled? Although most cyclists in the area were mountain bikers, M.C. knew of a bike shop in Squamish rid employees that were into road cycling, and a call there confirmed that yes, the road was a little tight, but from the point of view of one guy who cycled it regularly, it was perfectly safe in good weather if you were careful and highly visible (e.g. my tall orange flag would help a lot).

For summer the ski runs had been converted to mountain biking runs, with tight twisting tracks winding through the trees, and various obstacles set up for aerial tricks.

One thing to count on is Murphey&#8217;s Law &#8211; I cycled over 700 miles and never got a single flat, yet I had several major breakdowns despite a pre-trip checkup that would have been impossible to fix on the road.<br><br>I made it to Vancouver the day before the rains started, but rain didn&#8217;t stop me from getting out and enjoying the city. It is an excellent city to spend a rainy day in, especially Stanley Park. The pain in my right leg finally eased up and didn&#8217;t slow down my wandering at all, although the numbness in my hands lasted another 6 weeks (I&#8217;ve always had this problem riding, which has since gone away, I think through better riding form).<br><br>I also had one last little adventure in town as I arranged departure plans of taking a Greyhound to Seattle to see a friend before jetting down to L.A. for a job interview and back to Berkeley to begin my last semester of graduate school coursework. I needed to get another bike box to pack my bicycle in for transport on the bus (and shipping in Seattle), so I biked with my loaded touring rig to a bike shop in Yale Town to pick one up. The problem was the bus station was several miles away next to China Town.<br><br>Now, how to get my loaded bicycle and the bike box over there? I lashed the 3.5\'X4.5&#8217;X1&#8217; cardboard box diagonally across my back with used bicycle tire tubes and cycled along False Creek. Quite the sight since the box looked larger than I was. As I pulled in to the bus station, by bike fully loaded, with the huge box slung across my back, I rode up to a guy waiting out front.

The lower crux was more committing and physical, but straightforward on the moves, while the upper crux is intimidating and requires some thinking, but it can be well protected and is only a couple of moves, although height can play a big role in how hard those moves are.

As you get higher on the ridge, the rock improves, and the spectacular views continue to get better and better.

It has been banned outright off and on in the past.<br><b><u>Pack Strategy:</u></b>This is an important and tricky thing to work out, as the route is so long, and has a lot of wide, that carrying packs is difficult. However, because it is so long and exposed, with need to travel on glaciate terrain and to be prepared for wind and potential bad weather, it is risky to travel too light as well. See the Glacier Travel logistics for what we chose to do with that extra gear.<br>For us, what we tried and seemed to work well was bringing 2 packs: a moderate-sized camelback for the leader, and a larger pack (compressed Andanista Wild Things) for the follower. The leader carried a 3-liter camelback, a light jacket, and a small amount of food. The follower carried 1-2 liters of water to refill, both pair of boots, the glacier travel gear, and the bulkier jackets, in addition to some of the day\'s food, follower\'s light jacket, and first aid kit.<br>Alec only needed to trail the pack for a couple of sections on the wide climbing above the big sandy ledge, and no hauling was needed. As a follower, he was able to stay farther out and stem more on the wide sections. I was able to wear the follower pack on all of the pitches that I followed, with the toughest parts being pulling the 5.9+ lower roof crux, and the 5.10 face traverse near the end.<br><b><u>Approach/Descent Glacier Travel Logistics:</u></b>The descent to the base of the route is more serious than the glacier walk-off after the climb. We didn\'t find the routefindig hard or crevasses worrisome - in the conditions of the terrain (well-trodden path) and snow (not quite freezing) that we traveled in, we could have gotten by leaving our crampons behind and traveling unroped as we never traveled near any crevasses, and the angles rarely got all that steep (note, that nighttime freezing or lack of a path would have made crampons much more useful). Having one ax for the follower might be a good idea for insurance, though.<br>With our 60m doubles, we could easily reach completely flat snow on the last rappel, and you could get pretty close even with a single 60m. There is nothing nearby to slide into if you had to slide the last little bit. From there it is an easy, low-angle walk back to the col. There are a couple of small crevasses that are easy to avoid with proper routefinding, and it was no worse than the walk in from Applebee campground.<br>So in short, for our conditions, bringing 1 pair of crampons and 2 axes was overkill. We could have done just fine with one axe.<br><br>  Time (of day) Time (length) Notes    Leader Rating Left Pigeon Spire Col 3:30 am 2:20 hrs Approach &amp; P1 scramble. cl. 2-3 easy boulders.

I pulled my small fleece blanket a little higher on me and readjusted my head on the reclined drivers seat. I had made an 8hr drive from Salt Lake City, UT to Aspen, CO by myself in order to meet up with some other SPers from across the intermountain west to climb Capitol Peak, reportedly one of Colorado&#8217;s most difficult 14ers based on the class 4 rating of its knife-edge ridge.

The message board thread had received a lot of interest, and ultimately, we had a posse composed of yours truly from Salt Lake City, UT, Scott Patterson from Craig, CO, Brad Snider from Aurora, CO, Casey McCoy from Albuquerque, NM, Joel Schenk from Minnesota, and Kevin Donovan from Fort Worth, TX &#8211; truly a diverse group from all over the intermountain west.<br />I had arrived in Aspen the night before and failed to make contact with Joel and Casey, with whom I had hoped to share a campsite, so I drove around for a while before wandering my way out to the trailhead and going to sleep ca. 3am. Someone else was already camping at the trailhead, and I assumed that the person in the tent must be someone from our group. Finally my watch alarm went off at 6am &#8211; time to get up and head into town to meet the others. But this mysterious tent wasn&#8217;t stirring, and I was curious as to who it could be. I went back to sleep, waiting for them to get up first.<br />Finally I saw some signs of life and walked over to check it out &#8211; it was Casey.

After the convoy finally got moving, I noticed that Joel had been a bit slower to get out, and was actually bringing up the rear! After several horribly dusty miles we reached a pullout where he left his ride.<br />We headed out from the trailhead following the irrigation ditch approach variation. Granted its longer, but the other way lost 400 ft.

I was concerned about this as we would be more likely to be cliffed out by following so close to the base of the cliffs composing K2&#8217;s north ridge. Also, the terrain was steeper, and traversing steep slopes is a pain.

As I enjoyed a snack break, Casey and Kevin scouted a little further ahead and shouted back that the route wasn&#8217;t doable. All they could see was 5th class terrain with lethal exposure along a pinnacle-lined ridge. I was rather surprised as I knew that we were on route according to Roach&#8217;s guide, and my impression was that CO 4th class tended to be easier than the CA 4th class to which I was accustomed.<br />I scrambled up the ridge to have a look, and it didn&#8217;t look good. The ridge narrowed, dropped off, and arose as several pinnacles. Rocky ribs stuck out from the ridge, and it looked like they might drop off on the backside. The limit of my view was blocked by a large headwall that looked quite formidable. This just didn&#8217;t seem right, so while Casey scrambled a little further along the ridge to make his final evaluation, I looked around for an easier way &#8211; bingo. There was a break in the rock rib, so I walked along some class 2 talus, that just happened to be leveled about the width of a sidewalk. At the opening I could see down a moderate class 3 chimney that was some 7 feet high, and then a large class 2 bowl that could be used to easily bypass the pinnacles. This was definitely the way. Still, I wasn&#8217;t sure about the next headwall. I could pick out possible routes, but the steepness of the rock would dictate whether it was class 4 or 5. I would need to get closer.<br />Further reconnaissance would take more time, and we had already spent a good deal of time getting up the ridge, so I shouted my discoveries back to the others to see what they thought. It was a no go. They didn&#8217;t feel comfortable with the loose rock and exposure, and were worried about the extra time it could take. Kevin was a little P.O&#8217;d about why we had come up this way, as it was obviously not the main route (oops! I guess I hadn&#8217;t expressed my intentions clearly enough when leading!).  Since not everyone was used to loose rock, or scrambling with such exposure, I agreed that it would be safest to just reverse course and continue with our earlier traversing.<br />By the time we made it back to the snow we had spent almost 2 hrs on the ridge.

There are several places where you end by free climbing or stepping right. If you do so and don\'t go back to place a directional piece, this is terrible for your follower. Remember that rope drag at the end is not an issue (you\'re not taking in slack), and it sucks to transition from jugging to freeing, as you are making those moves without a belay! Just your jugs on a rope as an iffy self-belay, and if you don\'t move them up with you when you climb over and develop slack in the rope, you risk a rope-severing fall. Keep this in mind on the pitch where you change cracks as well.<br>Chimney is easy for 5.8. If trailing a pack, watch out at the crux, which is a bit bombay.

In a way it is classic, but it is NOT a Type I Fun sort of classic that people are accustomed to in Yosemite. There are some brushy sections, and a lot of the rock is loose or exfoliating. It also lacks the elegance of many of the lines in Yosemite, making the routefinding very difficult and the route much more reminiscent of an alpine climb (I have never climbed such an indirect \'direct\' variation). However, there are some stellar pitches, the views from the route are wonderful, and it is a good looong rock climb. The approach is also not to be underestimated involves a lot of hiking, cross-country travel, and scrambling or simul-climbing just to reach the base of the first pitch, nearly 2,000 ft above the Valley floor.

He saw a nice long ledge system traversing right and gradually up at class 4, but he wanted off the route NOW! Like an angry beast, he attacked the final 15 ft headwall directly. He made grunting noises on this part even louder than the wide pitches below. I could tell he was struggling to take an unnecessary, direct finish. Since he climbs much harder than me, I was a tad concerned. <br>\"Now Nic, don\'t forget that I have to follow that thing!\" I shouted. He backed off a bit to back up some gear, and renewed his attack. A few more grunts, scrapes, and curses later and finally the rope started moving quickly and then stopped. Now it was my turn. The finish Nic took was very tricky, and perhaps 5.10b (his best assessment. All I can say is it was hard!) A very awkward and off-balance corner in rotten rock led to a sandy, sloping ledge, requiring a funny heel hook &amp; body torque to surmount. <br>We topped out just before midnight. There we drank the rest of our water, ate the rest of our food, and took a 20 minute nap before heading down the Yosemite Falls trail, which was a mercifully easy descent.

I read that if you try to haul P3, your pack WILL get stuck in the top of the bombay chimney. The route gets sun all day (hot), but also gets a lot of sudden wind (cold), so bring a jacket (one for climbing OW in might be nice) and a lot of water. A large pack for the follower might be problematic in the wide pitches, so I feel like our strategy of climbing with two small, equal-sized packs worked well. <br />Be familiar with trailing packs on wide and pushing cams for this climb. With the wide, I\'d say you should be solid at Valley 5.8-5.9 wide before tackling this climb. None of it felt quite as hard as the hardest bits of the NE Buttress of Higher Cathedral Rock, but there was more of it here, it was tighter, and trailing a pack on lead makes it difficult in different ways.

Neither of us had enough time to do our Timp ridgeline &#8216;project&#8217; that weekend, but the Everest Ridge (aka. Big Baldy Ridge) on the west side of Mt Timpanogos seemed perfect for a single day climb.       <br />Since New Years eve the mountains had seen sustained high winds from the west, a recent thaw, and currently, an inversion with nighttime temperatures below freezing. This, I reasoned, would result in a hardened snowpack with a frozen crust on the western and southern slopes along that ridge, making for a perfect snow climb. Such conditions would also make our plan of climbing 6,560 ft in a day during the middle of winter feasible.   <br />We had planned on meeting at Joe&#8217;s house at 1:00 am, but a Sundance movie that I was attending ran later than expected.  This left me no time to sleep and no real dinner, both of which became problematic later. Luckily I wasn&#8217;t seriously late and we were soon on our way to Utah (Happy) Valley.   <br />My attempt to make up for lost time on the drive was hampered by the weather. A thick fogbank had rolled into the Salt Lake and Utah Valleys.  Although I had to slow down, we were lucky enough to find our way to the trailhead with only one missed turn and a run-in with some deer wandering the foggy hillside suburbs of Orem. We didn&#8217;t know what to expect at the trailhead due to all of the recent housing developments in the area, but luckily it was easy to find and had a good parking lot.   <br />The fog/smog created by the inversion ended just below the trailhead, leaving us with a crystal clear night sky and a full moon to enjoy.  The metropolitan region below us was nowhere to be seen.',NULL,NULL),(31499,956,4,3,'2:20 am:','With our 30lb daypacks strapped on, we headed up a rough trail that soon dumped us into the riverbed of Dry Canyon.  For a while the trail was clear and easy to follow, but soon the rocks encountered became larger and the brush began to close in.  Joe and I suspected something was wrong but we pressed on ahead anyways since our speed still seemed reasonably fast.  After a while I began to get fed up with our &#8216;trail&#8217; and decided that we must have lost the real trail and that it was probably on the northern end of the canyon above the creek.  I kept a sharp lookout on that end of the creek and soon I saw a wall of boards on the slope above.  That was either the trail or a pipeline &#8211; either way, better check it out.    <br />It was the trail!  Free of rocks, level, and clear of vegetation, this highway allowed us to make significantly better progress up the canyon. Soon we reached a clear meadow. The moonlit form of Timpanogos loomed above us, while the lights of Utah Valley shown below. The clouds obscured most of the detail, making the city lights appear as surreal colored clusters of glowing orbs in the clouds below.  A string of orbs was probably I-15, but beyond that there were no recognizable signs that the surreal night landscape below us was a city.   <br />The trail soon left the meadow and continued along the steep southern slopes of Mt Baldy. We soon encountered some rock hard patches of snow. Luckily the trail was well traveled and there was a cluster of footprints showing us the way to go all the way to the Big Baldy saddle.  Once the trail got into some deeper brush the snow softened (probably due to it receiving less sunlight) and we had to break out our snowshoes.  The trail turned north and steepened considerably. Soon we reached the border of a clearing allowing an uninterrupted view of the snow slopes rising over 3,000 feet straight up above us. The entire length of Everest Ridge was in full view, and the sight of such a long, open, and continuously steep ridge was at the same time intimidating and exhilarating.    <br />Rather than follow the edge of the clearing the rest of the way to the Big Baldy saddle, Joe and I cut across the open slopes and followed a faint ridge that became absorbed in the southern spur of Everest ridge.  The ridge provided some better views of the mountain, as well as some strange hiking over the large contoured cuts in the slope that are common in this part of the Wasatch Mountains.  Due to the overgrazing allowed by the earlier settlers, the hillsides had to have giant contoured steps cut into them to mitigate erosion and to allow the vegetation to grow back.',NULL,NULL),(31500,956,5,3,'4:45 am:','We reached the base of Everest Ridge. We had come 3 miles and 3,000 vertical feet since the trailhead. Now we had 3,500 feet to gain in the last 1.5 miles before the summit.  <br />The moonlight was so bright on the snow that we no longer needed our headlamps, so Joe and I stowed them and our snowshoes and got out our crampons and ice axes.  I headed up the steep headwall of the southern spur on the ridge.  At the steepest point I measured the slope with my inclinometer &#8211; 50<sup>o</sup>!

Rather than leave the ridge to traverse around it, we searched for a way that we could climb up it with our crampons on.  Joe found a nice line a little to the south of the main ridge.  A small rock spire jutted out from the cliff, which provided an excellent stepping stone for getting up the cliff. The rock was mostly solid and very blocky.  There were many small ledges, but almost everything was normal to the cliff or sloped slightly downward. This made the final move onto the snow-covered talus a little awkward with the mantle moves.

The light was still to faint for our digital cameras to capture much, especially since they wouldn&#8217;t let us take timed exposures.  Luckily I got a couple to come out crisp by using my ice axe as a tripod. A gorgeously sculpted bowl of snow stretched out before us, its sinuous crest leading the way up the final headwall before a short flat section and then the crux of the route, known as the &#8216;step&#8217;.  The step is a large cliff band, perhaps some 100 ft thick that extends several hundred feet north and south of the ridgeline before retreating into the slopes of Timpanogos.  This crux in normally bypassed by traversing around to the south, and this is where our problems began.<br />Traversing north or south required traversing on a slope that passed between the &#8216;step&#8217; and another set of large cliffs below. The space between the cliffs was angled back at about 40 degrees and was some 100 ft wide &#8211; a bad place to be caught in an avalanche.  The current cycle of avalanches were comprised of wet slides on southern aspects, and the avalanche danger rose as the snow became heated.  Because of this I was wary of following the standard traverse along the south slope of the ridge, since we would have to come back across this slope later in the day.  I could see the debris of a number of wet slides on the southern aspects surrounding us. Warning bells were going off in my head. The north facing slopes looked OK, there were no slides that I could see breaking off of them &#8211; let&#8217;s take the northern traverse.

I front-pointed partway out on it and then came back. I would have been fine if I had had two ice axes, but since I only had one mountaineering ice axe, I had to balance on my toes when I re-set my axe. I doubted that I could self arrest on this +40<sup>o</sup> slope before I went over the cliffs below me and I was aware that the ice sheet I was on was a thin sun crust.

Joe was still resistant to traversing to the north, so we compromised by going up a sliver of snow that cut straight up the cliffs. I had been checking out that sliver as a possible route from lower down on the ridge, and it looked feasible, apart from it ending about 15-20 feet short of the top of the cliffs. The first section involved ascending a steep section of snow bordering a 20 ft band of cliffs. I front pointed with my left foot while climbing on the rock to my right &#8211; one foot on rock, the other on snow.  A short ascending traverse through mixed snow and rock brought me to the final cliff. It was encrusted in a thick coating of rime. I hacked away at the rime for about 10 minutes. By then I had uncovered enough hand and footholds to climb partway up the cliffs and find a good handhold. I hung there and hacked away at the remaining rime for another good while. <br />Eventually the rock was completely free of rime and my arms were pumped.  I climbed up a bit higher and  could touch the snow above the cliffs. I had made it!  I searched around for a good solid handhold to cling to while I replaced my crampon points and stood up, but all I could find were small flat and sloping blocks with a dusting of snow. The snow above the cliffs was steep and powdering, covering loose scree.  Then I made a mistake &#8211; I looked down. If my hands slipped on the awkward mantle moves required I would free fall about 15 feet and land on the steep hard packed snow below and take off like a rocket for the first 60 feet before flying over another 20 foot cliff band, and then another 100 feet before I went off the big cliff below.

My drive had been adversely affected, but so had my thinking.  Joe was worried about the possibility of a dry avalanche on the north traverse.

Joe and I weren&#8217;t sure if he was Mormon, so we weren&#8217;t sure if he would care, but it was a nice extra boost anyway.  The weather forecast called for cloudy skies and a 20-30% chance for snow &#8211; with me taking the role of the optimist and Joe assuming that of the pessimist, our expectations balanced out nicely.  Also, recent avalanche activity was mimicking that of a spring cycle, with wet slides being the main foe, with the higher dangers now on the southern and southwestern aspects.  Since our last attempt, the Wasatch had seen another light snowstorm so there was a chance that we wouldn&#8217;t have the perfect snowpack like we did last time.  The inversion over the Wasatch Front had broken, so this time we could see the city lights below, which stood in wonderfully for lighting the snow slopes on Mt Timpanogos since our  full moon was now long gone.     <br />Joe and I took off strong from the trailhead, making sure to start out on the trail this time and not repeat our prior mistake of rushing up the creek instead.  Glenn kept up with us for the first few minutes, but eventually he fell further behind. We waited for him to catch up and then tried hiking at a slower pace, but he fell behind again. The next time he caught up I suggested that he hike in the middle to keep us reasonably together, but soon that fell apart.  Joe and I quickly crossed the meadow, me shaking my head disapprovingly at the burning campfire that some campers had left burning in the clearing.      <br />&#8220;Maybe I should pee it out, and punish them with the smell,&#8221; I suggested. Joe wasn&#8217;t as enthusiastic about the idea, so I kept on hiking.     <br />Once we had hiked through enough of the shaded parts of the trail to see that there would likely be no soft snow below the Big Baldy saddle, we agreed to cache our snowshoes and poles in the trees and pick them up on our way down.  Glenn caught up and did the same, and I marked the turnoff from the trail with an evil smiley-face carved in the snow while Joe took the GPS coordinates.      <br />This time I was more insistent on Glenn hiking in front to set the pace, but he declined - he said that he didn&#8217;t want to mess up our summit attempt by making us go at a slower pace.  Although this was very noble of him, I still wanted us to be reasonably close and meet up at the Big Baldy saddle.

No worries &#8211; we both felt refreshed and alert, and the sky was completely clear of clouds. Besides running a little slow everything was going well.  We had cut across the final clearing again and headed up the south ridge spur. As we neared the saddle I noticed a bright light towards where we were headed. Someone was camping at the saddle!  It looked like we would have some company (and competition?) on the route today.  These well-rested fellows donned their ice axes and crampons and headed out of camp about 15 minutes before we reached their point &#8211; if this were to be a competition then Joe and I started out with a handicap.     <br />Our foes took the north spur, and since Joe and I were familiar with the southern spur, we followed pursuit. Joe and I had waited at several points in the clearing to wait for Glenn, but there was no sign of him. He had been hiking his headlamp turned off earlier, so we expected it to be difficult to spot him from far off. Joe expected me to be able to catch up to him, so I waited another 10 minutes while Joe shot up the ridge. Reluctantly I gave up hope of having Glenn join us on the upper slopes of Timp and headed towards the first set of cliffs.     <br />This headwall was definitely steeper than that of the southern spur. I didn&#8217;t check with my inclinometer, but since the south spur rose up to 50<sup>o</sup>, I figured this slope reached 55<sup>o</sup>-60<sup>o</sup>.

I couldn&#8217;t find anyone else interested in climbing it, so I set out alone, leaving my car at 8am. Typical of most Wasatch western approaches, I started out in a Salt Lake City suburb, but quickly found myself isolated from the city. The trail began as a dirt road before fading into a series of branching and merging trails, all of which headed up the narrow mouth of Ferguson canyon. There are many striated granite cliffs here which are very popular for rock climbing, but this morning I was the only one in the canyon. The trail had started out very flat, the switchbacks to come were very flat, and the upper meadow was relatively flat, so most of the elevation gain was isolated into a few steep straight-a-ways on the trail, making it steeper than the average elevation gain would lead one to believe.',29163,NULL),(31553,958,2,NULL,NULL,'The trail was hard to follow since there were so many other use-trails in the area, and the stream, full from spring runoff, filled in much of the main trail. I persisted, walking up a swamped trail, crossing rocks to the north side of the stream, to avoid some cliffs dropping directly into the stream. From there I hiked straight up a very steep hill, missed the next crossing, but forded the stream on some bushes and rocks a little ways farther up the canyon. I crossed to the north side of the stream again on a log and took my first 3 minute break.  I was resolved to rest for three minutes every half hour, and it was now 8:30 am.  A few minutes after my first break I encountered the switchbacks. These were very flat and I made good time on them.  I paid special care to avoid taking the branch to the lookout and found the switchback that continued up the canyon from the more commonly traveled trail. From here the trail became even more overgrown and never got much better - apparently not many people continue up Ferguson Canyon to hike Storm Mountain. After the final switchback I entered a meadow with a nice view of the surrounding canyon, which had begun to broaden as I ascended higher. There were still many scattered cliffs high above me on the ridgelines.',29164,NULL),(31554,958,3,NULL,NULL,'As I hiked on I kept hearing popping sounds that I attributed to some construction project going on in the suburbs below &#8211; now that I had line-of-site with the city I could begin to hear some of its sounds.

As I neared the cliffs above me the faint trail began to ease up on the abuse that the low branches were wreaking on my legs and I entered a dry stream bed. The trail continued straight up the steep stream bed with occasional detours onto the upper sides of the ditch before eventually topping out in a flat meadow above the cliffs on the south side of the canyon. From here I had my first glimpse of the cirque. It was close now and I knew that I would be at the base of the peak in a matter of minutes.  I walked to a joining meadow to the south before cutting through some pine trees and aspens to another meadow to the north. From here I continued cross country on a series of linked meadows along the base of the north slopes of the canyon. Occasionally I followed a faint use trail, but it disappeared often. While the standard route up the peak was to follow the meadows to the end of the cirque and scramble south on the ridge to the peak, I decided to take the alternate route listed by John Veranth in his &#8220;Hiking the Wasatch&#8221; trail guide, which ascends the west ridge of the peak, on the north side of the canyon.',29166,NULL),(31556,958,5,NULL,NULL,'As I neared the base of the peak, keeping close to the north side of the meadows, I saw a twisting chute gouged out of the rocky ridge. It has a lone tall pine tree in it and it appeared to be a good way to access the ridge with a minimum amount of light bush-wacking. The quartzite rocks in the chute were a little loose, but not too bad. Once I got above the pine tree I traversed west on some ledges to gain the ridge. From here it was a nice scramble to the summit. It was mostly class 2 with a few 15-25 ft class 3 walls, and there was only a little bit of brush that was in the way. There was never much exposure, but the views were incredible.  I could hear popping sounds again and this time I realized that it was not hammering at a construction site, but rather, gun shots. I could see a shooting range on a plateau above the mouth of Big Cottonwood canyon 4,000 feet below me.<br><br>I reached the summit at 10:30am and was surprised to find another summit register &#8211; I had only seen registers on a few other Wasatch peaks. It turned out to be a geocache. These are registers left at hidden locations around the US as part of a nationwide treasure hunt &#8211; people would load geocache coordinates from a website into a GPS unit and would hunt for them. The caches contained a register and some odd items &#8211; people who found the caches were encouraged to take something from the cache and leave something behind. Inside the cache was a business card, a membership ID, a plastic Chihuahua form a fast food chain, some currency with Cyrillic writing on it (perhaps its Russian?), and a skier figure made out of soldered screws, a wing-nut, and other metal items.  I called my father from the summit on my cell phone, wrote in the register, had a snack, and took some of the coins from the register. I didn&#8217;t have much to give back, but I left 3 granola bars with my summit date attached for the next discoverers to eat.',29167,NULL),(31557,958,6,NULL,NULL,'I had originally planned to do the mountaineering traverse along a narrow ridge and over several unnamed peaks to reach the Broad Fork Twin Peaks, but the snow was so sloppy that I decided to leave the route for when the snow had fully melted or the following spring.

Luckily I spotted a chute below me that seemed to go all the way down to the meadow, and I headed down it. The chute had a lot of loose rock, but it still seemed a more pleasant descent alternative for me. As I reached the meadow I met a party of 5 people heading up the meadow.

I had spent my last few weeks in California squeezing in as many mountaineering trips as possible, and now that I was back in Salt Lake City, with the mountains so close, I was desperate to get out into the mountains.  Luckily, my friend Alan Stenquist was interested in doing a hike, and we planned to do something in the Wasatch Mountains the first Thursday that I was back in Utah.<br><br>After pondering several options, Alan and I decided to hike Box Elder Peak &#8211; it was one of the few major Wasatch Peaks that I had yet to summit, and it seemed like a nice trip to see how the spring snow conditions were in the Wasatch Range. By default we had originally planned to hike the north ridge. I wanted to approach it via the Dry Creek trail in Alpine, since it gained 3,950 feet to the Dry Creek divide, but Alan talked me into taking the easier Deer Creek trail, which began in American Fork canyon and only gained 2,700 feet to the divide. Since there was still 4,341 feet to be gained by taking that route, I was willing to take the easier route. After looking at a USGS topo for the area and some photos I had taken of the north side of Box Elder Peak from Lone Peak the previous June, I could pick out what looked to be a more exciting and unlisted route heading up the massive cirque on the north side, winding through several cliff bands. As we drove to the trailhead Thursday morning, I tried to convince Alan to do this more adventurous route, but he wouldn&#8217;t budge &#8211; we would hike the north ridge from Dry Creek Divide, and I would return another day to try out my route.<br><br>After a straightforward ½ hour drive to the trailhead, we began hiking shortly after 7 am. We began at a fast pace, but slowed up after the first half hour. Alan kept falling behind because of some lingering knee pains and the vegetation in the canyon was affecting my asthma.  I also realized that we had all day to do this simple hike, and there was no need to hurry. We stopped occasionally to admire the views of the canyon and the north face of Mt Timpanogos.  The trail was well maintained and had a good amount of shade, but views were never obstructed.<br><br>Strangely, the Dry Creek Divide was not the lowest point on the ridge at the end of the canyon, but was instead about ¼ of a mile north and a few hundred feet higher. The trail switch-backed consistently to the east to avoid a large talus slope, and eventually crossed it near the top, just below some cliffs. The rocks here were piled in odd lumps that the trail wound around. As Alan and I wound around these piles of dirt, talus, and scree, I wondered if the slope debris was actually mine tailings rather than a result of natural erosion.<br><br>Soon after crossing the debris field, Alan and I arrived at a beautiful flat meadow at the Dry Creek Divide. We had been hiking for about 2.5 hours and were a little hungry, so we stopped to eat some snacks and take a few photos of Mt Timpanogos.  From here the trail heading south to Box Elder Peak became very faint. It was obvious that few people hiked on this trail since little bits of vegetation were beginning to take root in the middle of the trail.<br><br>The headwall to the north ridge began at 9,400 feet and it still held a lot of snow. The lower part of the ridge offered a fun snow climb with a slope that undulated from as little as a 5<sup>o</sup> incline to over 45<sup>o</sup> within 20 feet of hiking. As we neared the top of the ridge, the snow became noticeably softer and soon we were post-holing with every step. Even though it was only a little after 10pm, the sun had already warmed the snow to a point were it was difficult to travel on it. I debated putting on my long pants and gaitors, but since the summit was so close I didn&#8217;t want to put them on for such a small distance. Since Alan had long pants on, I got him to break trail from this point to minimize the pain of snow crystals scraping my bare legs from post-holing.<br><br>Alan and I arrived on the summit at about 11:30, 4.5 hours since leaving the trailhead. The rocks on the summit seemed to be covered with lots of read algae, but once we got closer we saw that the red color was actually thousands of Lady Bugs swarming over the rocks!<br><br>The summit was marked with a tall pole, and it contained a summit register. I was quite happy to see this since I&#8217;m unaccustomed to seeing registers on Wasatch Peaks, and I&#8217;ve enjoyed their presence on Sierra summits. The log had a lot of coarse language and bitching (more so than in the Sierra summit logs), especially from a Lithuanian who ended his message by stating that he hated everything. I was caught off guard by this since the summit overlooked the Provo metropolitan area, which was surely one of the most conservative cities in the United States &#8211; I was quite amused. Keeping with the odd spirit of the summit log, my friend Alan ranted about how easy the peak was, and that he could have climbed it using a unicycle on a pogo stick. By the time we had eaten some food and signed the summit register I was ready to head down &#8211; the lady bugs had begun to swarm all over my bare legs and they were beginning to tickle me.<br><br>Alan and I decided to head down the south slopes and hike out the Dry Creek trail, and after securing a ride from his girlfriend, Alan and I took off down the west side of the mountain. It was mostly free of snow, suited us since it had become too soft to be enjoyable. Luckily there was a long snow sliver in a gully lower down, and it was just barely hard enough to glissade. Alan and I did a standing glissade for a few hundred feet, and by the time we got to the end of the snow, we were almost to the pack trail that circumvented the peak. It was faint but straightforward to follow back to the Dry Creek trail. A long, straight, steep trail led us down to Alpine. It didn&#8217;t have many opportunities for views, but near the bottom we spotted a gorgeous waterfall, perhaps 50 feet high and flowing strong.<br><br>Eventually we reached the mouth of the canyon and the beginnings of the latest urban sprawl developments. It had taken us about 2.5 hours to get down from the summit. After walking a short ways down the dirt road, Alan&#8217;s girlfriend, &#8216;fish stick&#8217;, arrived, and she shuttled us back to our car at the Deer Creek trailhead. Overall the moderately strenuous hike was very pleasant, with wonderful views, with some very interesting geological features along the route.',NULL,NULL),(31729,960,2,3,'Links',NULL,NULL,NULL),(31730,961,0,2,'Surviving a 1,000 ft Fall on Mt Nebo',NULL,NULL,NULL),(31731,961,1,3,'February 19, 2005','<font color=\"BLUE\"><u>Stats</u></font> <br /><b>Route:</b> <a href=\"http://www.summitpost.org/show/route_link.pl/route_id/2029/object_id/1443\">Cedar Ridge</a> <br /><br /><b>Elevation Gained:</b> TBA  <br /><br /><b>RT Distance:</b> TBA  <br /><br /><b>RT Time:</b> 2 Days  <br /><br /><b>Trailhead:</b> Willow Creek  <br /><br /><b>TH Elevation:</b> 5,695 ft  <br /><br /><b>Elevation of Accident:</b> ca. 11,100&#8217;  <br /><br /><b>Rating:</b> III, Moderate Snow  <br /><br /><b>Climbers:</b> <a href=\"http://www.summitpost.org/mountains/user_link.pl?user_id=13451\">Mark Thomas</a>, <a href=\"http://www.summitpost.org/cgi-bin/user_link.pl?user_id=16537\">Joe Bullough</a>, <a href=\"http://www.summitpost.org/mountains/user_link.pl/user_name/bc44caesar\">Casey</a>',29333,NULL),(31732,961,2,3,'Friday, February 18th','Joe and I pulled to a stop at the mouth of Willow Creek Canyon shortly after 6:45 pm. We had just reached the unmarked trailhead for that weekend&#8217;s outing: a winter ascent of Mt Nebo via Cedar Ridge.  Storms and high winds were moving in that weekend, with 1.5&#8217; of snow forecasted for the mountains that night, but we had decided to go ahead with the trip anyway.  Nebo&#8217;s Cedar Ridge was heavily forested until the last 1,500 ft before the summit, and the route would be on a ridgeline the entire way, rarely reaching a steepness that would have one concerned about avalanches.  Because of the relative ease and safety of the route, we figured that it would be a safe route to do under the conditions, as long as we stayed on the route and avoided any questionable slopes.<br />  As Joe and I got our gear ready, Casey hopped out of his car to greet us.  Casey was a climber on Summitpost whom we had agreed to have along on the trip &#8211; he was heading up to the Wasatch to do some skiing and climbing and had expressed interest on an online thread about climbing Nebo via Cedar Ridge.  After hearing about what sort of trips he had been on and reading about him in Scott Patterson&#8217;s latest trip report on their climb up CO&#8217;s Mt Massive, Joe and I welcomed the extra company.  <br />  We went over the route on the topographic map together and then headed up the steep slopes of Mt Nebo.  We weren&#8217;t sure how far we were going to go up the mountain that night, but we had talked about camping either at 7,724&#8217; or 9,000&#8217;. Casey had seen the mountain in the daylight before Joe and I had arrived and had noticed that there were a lot of cliffs barring access to the main ridge spur, so we headed up a side spur in hopes of regaining the ridge higher up.  <br />  The detour turned out to be a mistake &#8211; the clear terrain became brushy as we headed higher. Since Scott had reported on Summitpost that he never encountered much bushwhacking we suspected that we were off route, but continued on in hopes of regaining Cedar Ridge higher up. Joe began to express concerns about getting cliffed out as he reached a narrow point in the ridge. I looked down to the left and saw a large snowy clearing below that led to a long silvery tongue of snow that seemed to stretch from the valley all the way up to the camps we were hoping to reach. There was too much of a drop below to make descending to the flats safe, so I continued along the ridge to see if there was a better way to descend. Just as I reached a large cliff I saw that I could get down to the snow slopes below by down climbing some snow free rock just a short ways back from the cliff.  The landing looked good, sloping away from the cliff, so in case I fell or needed to jump I was safe from falling off.  <br />  The scrambling was more difficult than expected &#8211; the rock was very steep and sharp. It was also a little slick lower down since there was a little snow on it. I grabbed a large flake and lie-backed as I moved down. Once I reached the end of the flake I found some knobby rock to grip on the underside, but beyond that there were no more handholds.  I gripped the rock, lowered myself as far as I could, and failing to find any secure footholds, dropped the last 2 feet onto the snow slope. I called for the others to follow me down and then continued to break trail down the slope to a saddle joining Cedar Ridge to the spur that we were on.  <br />  &#8220;Oh my god!&#8221; Casey exclaimed once he reached the saddle. I had directed his attention back to where we had down climbed &#8211; he hadn&#8217;t seen the cliff earlier. The highpoint of the ridge and the cliff on the back side was large enough that I was able to identify it on the topo map. Our route had taken us to the brink of a sheer drop off. After a brief water break we headed toward the snow tongue only to find that the tongue was an old avalanche debris field &#8211; the snow was hard-packed and packed full of stones and snapped pine trees. The debris was very old and the current unstable slopes were on the north and east aspects at the time, rather than the south facing slope we were ascending, so I decided that a night-time ascent of the sliver was safe.   <br />  The snow provided a fast easy way up the slope, since the rest of the hillside was covered with thick scrub oak.  Casey hadn&#8217;t expected such tough terrain on the first 3,000 feet of the route and had chosen to wear his lighter shoes at the time, and this made the going tough for him.  Since he knew that we were close to a camping place by then, he chose to take off through the scrub oak toward a hopefully clear ridge rather than changing into his stiffer boots.  Joe and I headed higher, taking occasional GPS readings as we ascended to keep track of our progress. Casey was tired from his long drive up from New Mexico and wanted to camp at the lowest camp, so we were going to have to leave the snowfield at some point to traverse over to the ridge.  <br />  I was a little overzealous in making progress up the hill, and suddenly we were at 8,100 ft.  OOPS! Casey was too far away to hear us through the winds, so we bashed our way through the brush over to the ridge to explain the situation.  Joe and I regretfully informed him that we had passed the first camp, but then I tried to talk him into climbing higher. I really didn&#8217;t want to lose and regain 400 ft, and by heading up to the next camp we would have that much less distance to cover tomorrow. Casey agreed to give it a try, with the understanding that we would head back down if the going got too tough. Luckily the ridge was clear and we made fast progress up the ridge.    <br />  At 8,400&#8217; Joe and Casey found a nice campsite sheltered by some trees and the slope, so we dug our platforms for the tents and settled down for the night sometime around 11pm. Joe and I stayed up to have dinner and melt water, and by the time we went to sleep it was 2am.',29334,NULL),(31733,961,3,3,'Saturday, February 19th',NULL,NULL,NULL),(31734,961,4,3,'6:00 am - Breaking Camp','The howling winds had kept us awake last night, and occasionally a spindrift blew into the tent and onto my face. Still, we were well-rested enough to make a good summit attempt that day. As luck would have it the 1.5 ft of snow never appeared, so all that we had to look forward to was snow that was for the most part hard-packed. The wind scouring from the night before would make things even easier &#8211; our chances at making the summit looked good.  <br />  By about 8:00 am we had camp broken down and cached on the platforms to protect it from the wind. After marking a GPS coordinate to locate the cache upon our return, we headed up the ridge. We could see Mona far below, but soon we climbed above the cloud deck and were in a completely different world. The wind blew constantly at round 15mph with gusts up to 30mph, sometimes flinging stinging graupel into our faces.  As the temperature dropped ice began to form on my eyelashes. The going was tough, but it was also exciting!  <br />  At 10,400&#8217; we stopped for a brief snack. Tree line was finally making itself apparent and the more rugged parts of the ridge were beginning to appear.  There were some small cornices overhanging about a foot and we took notice of these.  Although visibility had deteriorated to a milky white after about 100 ft, we could still see some of the ridgeline ahead. By looking ahead we could see if there were cornices on the stretch ahead and how far back to stay. None of the cornices were very large.  <br />  Although we kept on eye on what we could see, we mostly trudged along mindlessly in the tracks of whoever was breaking trail at the moment. The air was thin, dry and cold, the graupel stung our eyes, and we were very tired. Since Joe and I weren&#8217;t as concerned about this route as we had been on others we had climbed earlier in the winter, we fell into a false sense of complacency.',NULL,NULL),(31735,961,5,3,'11:00 am - Falling','The ridgeline had become more open as the trees disappeared, but the slope was still very gradual, so everyone was still hiking with trekking poles &#8211; there was no need for ice axes.  As the slope began veering further to the right we could no longer see the left side of the ridge ahead. This was the side that the cornices were forming on.  <br />  As I plodded up the slope I casually lifted my head up to take in what view I could when I noticed that we were walking parallel to the ridge, about 5 feet back from the edge. I also saw that the edge ended sharply &#8211; it was likely corniced.

My arms were outstretched but there was nothing to grab on to &#8211; I slipped back and suddenly I was airborne.  The slope below was so steep that I don&#8217;t recall feeling any impact. One moment I was falling and the next I was sliding, standing vertically on my toes as I tried to dig them into the slope.

I was still frantic at the thought that I might accelerate again off of a cliff or down another steeper pitch in the slope, so I made the best of this deceleration and tried to swim up and out of the snow as I kicked my feet into the slope.  <br />  Suddenly it was all over. I was no longer sliding. I brushed off a few inches of snow that was still covered me and stood up to take account of the situation. I was alive! Miraculously my only injuries seemed to be a slightly sore left quad, side and Latissimus Dorsi which were probably strained as I tried to keep myself upright and close to the hill as I fell. Then the severity of the accident hit me &#8211; I was in the middle of a gigantic avalanche debris field. Chunks of snow stretched away from me as far as I could see. I looked at my topo map to get my bearings &#8211; I had fallen around 1,000 vertical feet! Through the ghostly clouds and wind I faintly heard some shouting from above.  Joe and Casey were all right!  I couldn&#8217;t make out what they were saying and I was still out of breath, so all I could manage was a single loud yelp &#8211; &#8220;YEAH!&#8221;',29338,NULL),(31739,961,9,NULL,NULL,'I thought about where I was and realized that I was still NOT in a safe place to be. Rather than being on the safe wind-scoured southern slopes of Cedar Ridge, I was now at the bottom of a large, open snow bowl. Based on the aspect of the slopes above me, I knew that the side of the bowl closest to me was north-facing, corniced, and had had heavy wind-loading from the past 24 hours.  Other avalanches could easy be washing down into the bowl.<br />  The safest option I could think of at the time was to climb back up the way I had slid down. That slope had already avalanched, so it should be relatively safe compared to the rest of the slopes.  Besides, I was still a little delusional in thinking that I could just climb back out.  Sure it was about 1,000&#8217;, but I had all day, and maybe the upper slopes weren&#8217;t as steep as they looked on the topo.<br />  I climbed up the ridge, but I was so pumped full of adrenaline and fear of further avalanching that I couldn&#8217;t keep a sustained pace. I kept getting exhausted and would stop every couple of minutes to rest. During these stops I tried to make contact with Joe and Casey. I was still rattled enough that I forgot about the emergency whistle in my pack, so I wasted breath shouting as loudly as I could.  Because of the winds I didn&#8217;t know if Joe and Casey had heard my earlier response &#8211; I was worried that they thought I was dead! Throughout my time climbing back up the chute I never got a response.',29339,NULL),(31740,961,10,NULL,NULL,'My shouting echoed strangely, and as I ascended I saw why. Alongside the slope I slid down was a HUGE cliff! I let out a slew of exasperated cursing and kept climbing up the hill. The debris field seemed like it would never end. Finally I reached the scoured bed surface and encountered another surprise &#8211; a large gash in the slope, perhaps 15 feet wide and about 2 feet deep. Whatever had avalanched had ripped out this gouge clear down to the underlying talus! This was probably one of the parts of the slope that sent me airborne. For some reason I got out my camera to photograph it &#8211; perhaps it was an over learned reaction. About 50 feet higher I saw another gouge.   Then I reached a continuous crown that was a few inches thick.  The chute had a slight convexity in the center, so the crown had extended to the convexity, and shot straight up the slope for quite some ways before finishing its release to the other side. Just in case anything else came down the chute I stayed on this convexity in hopes than any further slides would wash to the sides.<br />  The slope steepened and the bed surface became harder as I passed two more crowns. The slope seemed to be around 40 degrees now and I could barely kick steps, so I switched from my snowshoes to my crampons and got out my ice axe. As I front-pointed up the slope the ground got steeper and I became more concerned &#8211; if the snow was really getting as hard and steep as it seemed, then I probably couldn&#8217;t climb out!  <br />  Suddenly I saw a dark line in the clouds &#8211; was this a rockband?  As I got closer I could see the wall with greater clarity. It too was a crown, but this one was almost as deep as I was tall!! I guessed that it was around 4.5 ft deep since it was about as high as my shoulders. It was monstrous, snaking like some evil serpent as it wound its way up the convexity like the earlier crowns, disappearing into the clouds above me. To the side of me I saw a foot-thick slab within the crown that had slid partway out beneath the snowpack, but friction had held it suspended. HANGFIRE!  Now I was really nervous. I climbed a little higher and saw that the thick crown at fractured into some thinner crowns on the other side of the convexity, allowing me to wind my way between the slabs.  At this point I lost my nerve to climb out this way. I had been climbing up the chute for an hour, but by now I didn&#8217;t care about making that wasted time.',29340,NULL),(31741,961,11,NULL,NULL,'I carefully but quickly backed down the slope and within about 20 minutes of continuous movement I reached the end of the cliffs beside the chute.

It looked like there was a possibility of it cliffing out, and I would end up a long ways north of Willow Creek. I doubted that I would be out before nightfall if I went that way.  Also, I was worried that Joe and Casey were heading out, and I was anguished at the thought of the news of my likely death reaching my family &#8211; I HAD to get out and get in touch with them before something like that happened!<br />  Finally I spotted a route that seemed safe and possible. About half a mile down the canyon the slopes were heavily forested and they also looked less steep than the slopes surrounding the bowl that I was in. There was a slight ridge on that slope and it met up with Cedar Ridge at about 10,400 ft. I remembered that point on the ridge! The terrain on that part of the ridge looked thickly forested and didn&#8217;t appear too steep. I traversed down the canyon, praying all the while that I didn&#8217;t set off any slides above me. I stayed a little high near the base of the cliffs but on a low angled slope. Every now and then I had to cross a break in the cliffs, and I did so quickly.',29342,NULL),(31743,961,13,NULL,NULL,'As I hiked down through the swirling white, graupel began to rain down. As it fell, the graupel didn&#8217;t stick to the slopes like snowflakes would. Instead, the balls of snow just rolled down the slopes, piling up in depressions and on flatter inclines. So much graupel was rolling down from above that the air was alive with a hissing sound.  Every now and then I ran into a thick patch of graupel, and although I was now hiking in my snowshoes, I sank in up to my waist in these little ball bearings. It was like wading through an exploded beanbag.   <br />  Finally trees emerged from the clouds and my hopes began to rise. The forest became thicker, but the snow became softer. I had to face into the hill on some traverses to keep from sliding down through the deep powder, but at least I was safer! As I looked up the slope I could make out rocky ribs rising above the treetops &#8211; definitely not the place to head back up. I could tell that it would be difficult to tell when I should start climbing back up.  <br />  Eventually I reached deep and narrow chute cutting down the slopes. I couldn&#8217;t get into the chute because it was lined with cliffs, making the last 10-20 feet or so quite impassable. On the other side was a heavily forested ridge that rose as high as I could see. This might be the way out!  I followed the cliffs down a ways until I could find a drop that looked safe enough to descend. The snow was too steep to get purchase, so I stepped onto small pines lining the chute. I would hang onto the tree as I lowered/slid down to the next small pine, and repeated the process until I could slide the last few feet into the bottom of the chute. Then I ran across and tried to climb out the other side. Once again the snow kept sluffing off, so I had to pull myself up the slope by grabbing some of the small pines sticking out of the snow. Finally I was out of the chute and on the ridge!  <br />  The ridge was very steep and the snow was very loose. I tried to snowshoe up, but as I pulled snow down I soon ended up chest deep in the stuff without having made any upward progress &#8211; I was only digging myself deeper into the hill.  Through a combination of jumping and swimming with my forearms and poles, I was able to get through the easier parts. In the more difficult snow I had to pack down as much snow as I could, kick a step as deep as I could and as high as I could, plunge both poles into the snow above as deep as the handles. Then, as I pulled and then pushed down on the poles, I slowly raised myself on one leg, careful not to collapse the step. Once my leg was extended I replaced my poles higher, one at a time, and began working on placing the next foot.  <br />  Progress was agonizingly slow, and sometimes it took several minutes to cover a few feet. The snow was so unstable that any rushing caused footholds to collapse, and it was a total body workout to make any progress up the hill.  Finally I got a rhythm down, and occasionally I reached short patches of snow stable enough to just walk on.  My heart had been beating furiously since I had fallen and I never seemed to be able to catch my breath - I always felt like I was about to be exhausted, but after a short break I always seemed to find the strength to move on. Picking resting points at landmarks every 20 feet or so seemed to help make the climb more psychologically manageable.  <br />  Finally the sky above the trees turned lighter and I caught a glimpse of the ridge above. I was going to get out!  I pushed extra hard during the last bit and soon I was back at our tracks on Cedar Ridge ridge.',NULL,NULL),(31744,961,14,3,'4:40pm - Calling off the Search','I reached the ridge at 4:40. By then I had remembered my whistle, so I blew on it in hopes that Joe and Casey were somewhere on the ridge where they could hear it.  I hadn&#8217;t drunk any water since the fall, so I forced myself to drink some before racing down to camp. Once I got there I saw that everything had been cleared out &#8211; they guys were on their way down. From my vantage point I could see our cars 3,000 ft below. There were a lot of other vehicles there too. Since we hadn&#8217;t parked at a real trailhead I doubted that these vehicles were those of other hikers &#8211; it was SAR (Search and Rescue)!  <br />  Finally I had cell reception back, so I called my father. I got the voicemail, so I said something to the tune of   <br />  &#8220;Hi Dad. It&#8217;s about 5:00 and I&#8217;m calling to let you know that we&#8217;ve been delayed a little bit on getting down the mountain, so we won&#8217;t be getting home by late afternoon like I said we would. We&#8217;ll probably be home sometime late evening. I love you, bye!&#8221; I admit that was a vague message, but at the time I didn&#8217;t want to scare him since I was fine, and I figured that if he then heard about the accident he would know that I was all right since I gave the late time that I had called.  <br />  I knew that Joe didn&#8217;t have his cell phone on him, and I didn&#8217;t have Casey&#8217;s number, so next I called Shelley, Joe&#8217;s wife.    <br />  &#8220;Hey Shelley, have you spoken to Joe lately?&#8221; She was well aware of the situation and was thrilled to hear my voice. I told her that I was all right and to tell everyone to call off the search. Then I raced down the ridge.  <br />  A few minutes later Casey called me on my cell phone.  I answered as I hiked down the mountain. He was relieved as I told him that I was racing down the mountain, nearing the 7,724&#8217; flats and to call off the search.

A little embarrassed, I hoped that I was high enough that the rescuers in the parking lot didn&#8217;t see me tripping over myself.  <br />  I was heading down a wash about a quarter-mile from the trailhead when I saw searchers heading up through the brush. I hopped onto a rock and waved my poles in the air to get their attention.  I hurried down to them and was immediately inundated with questions.  <br />  &#8220;Do you have any aches or pains?&#8221;  <br />  &#8220;Just a little soreness in my back and right side.&#8221;  <br />  &#8220;We saw you falling down a few times up higher, are you all right?&#8221;  <br />  &#8220;Umm, yeah.&#8221;  <br />  &#8220;Did you have any loss of consciousness?&#8221;  <br />  &#8220;No. But I&#8217;m very dehydrated. Can we get some water out of my pack?&#8221;  <br />  Everyone rushed around me and they were almost overbearing in their care as they &#8216;assisted&#8217; me in sitting down and taking off my wet outer layers of clothing. I was getting hot on the way down and had opened them to ventilate, so I was a little irritated when they replaced my hot clothes with a warm jacket, but at least it was dry. The mood was quite light as we strolled down to the car. The rescuers talked about some nice hunts they had had in the Willow Creek area as we walked down the hill.

My heart rate was very high and I had a lot of adrenaline in my system, as was expected. My left foot turned grey and went numb as the adrenaline subsided. My feet were re-heated but because my big toenail was black and took longer to recover, there was a concern of frostbite, so I was taken to a hospital in Nephi for a follow up examination before being released.  <br />  The news media had caught wind of the rescue and were on the scene at the trailhead. Channel 4 followed me to the hospital and tried to pressure me into an interview as I hurried to the getaway car that Joe was driving, but I managed to escape.

None of them had all of the information correct, but all of them were using my full name. As I drove home with Joe I thought that everything was over and I could put it behind me, but I couldn&#8217;t get any relief.

After checking with Joe and Casey on how much anonymity they wanted, I went ahead and sat for an interview with ABC. Apparently even though they advertised the interview on the evening news broadcast, the interview was never broadcasted on Good Morning America.

They also couldn&#8217;t try to reach me on my phone to determine my condition. I had brought 2 Motorola T5950 radios on the trip, but the intent was to practice with them for better communication on climbs where we would be traveling further apart. I had left them in the tent. In the future ideally everyone should have a radio and a cell phone if at all possible (in this instance we all could have brought a cell phone and a radio). For a more lightweight and reliable means of emergency communication, we all should have had emergency whistles and a predetermined set of codes by which to communicate with them (e.g. 2 blows for I&#8217;m OK, frantic blowing for HELP ME!!). I had a whistle, but that only limited me to blowing like a madman with no ability to communicate any better with others.    <br /><br /><b>Complacency:</b> Ultimately, what caused the accident was that Joe and I were too complacent on the route.  Our largest concern on winter outings had been avalanches, and since the route was safe from such a danger (or we could recognize a danger if one did exist based on obvious terrain criteria) we let our guard down in just following the tracks of whoever was leading. On trips where we have been more nervous we&#8217;ve always looked around for ourselves, rather than just following the leader. In this instance that would have prevented us all from getting on the cornice as Joe and I would have made our observations of the danger BEFORE we were within 5 feet of the edge.

The largest linkup I had dreamed up was to traverse from our base camp at the Lower Saddle over to Valhalla Canyon. There we could gain the Grandstand via the classic Serendipity Arete on Mt. Owen and a traverse from that summit (although one could directly climb the Grandstand from Valhalla Canyon). The Grandstand would serve as our launching point for climbing our main objective of the carryover - the North Ridge of the Grand Teton, from which we could then return to our remaining gear cache at the Lower Saddle. <br>The Valhalla Traverse was the key to us achieving this ambitious linkup as we could make a complete loop from the Lower Saddle without any need to hike back out. It was a wonderful idea, but it was also ambitious. We had originally planned to do the Valhalla Traverse the same day as the Complete Exum Ridge (the guidebook said we only needed 3-4 hrs to do the traverse), then climb Serendipity Arete to the Grandstand in a long day, and then finish climbing over the North Ridge. This would mean we would spend 2.5 days and 2 nights doing the linkup.<br>However, conditions on the Exum slowed us up enough that we decided not to tempt fate with the Valhalla Traverse that day, so we left an entire day for it, on the worst weather day forecast for our trip. Since I was wary about any additional weather slowing us up, we decided to pack for 4 full days and 3 nights\' worth of food and fuel just in case we were delayed a day.

Joe Bullough and I had come on a tight itinerary to climb the Grand Teton via the Exum ridge car-to-car. This decision was made mostly for practical purposes (Joe had to take advantage of the bi-annual landscaping waste service that would be in his neighborhood Sunday), but also in the spirit of our recent habits of making <i>EVERYTHING</i> a &#8216;day hike&#8217;. We had hoped to get here earlier for a few hours of sleep, but unfortunately we had some problems leaving as early as we had hoped, so we were doing this climb with a sleep handicap.<br />  We quickly packed up our gear amidst the other climbers sleeping in their vehicles and stole away into the night. It was very still and cooler than expected, and we made a good pace up the trail. Joe was very worried about running into a bear in the dark, and every few minutes he&#8217;d call out, just in case. I joined in the fun by making loud &#8220;beeeeooowhooop!&#8221; calls, hoping this JarJar Binx call would help scare any bears away. This constant lookout for bears made things a little more tense, especially when we thought we saw eyes ahead of us on the trail (turned out to be city lights, duh!).  <br />  Soon we reached the dreaded mega-switchbacks that lead up to Surprise and Amphitheater lakes. I&#8217;d been up these two times too many (i.e. twice), but luckily I counted the switchbacks on the topo before reaching them, so I could count them down until we reached the Garnet Canyon trail junction.  The 5 switchbacks passed by shortly and soon I was in new country, heading up Garnet Canyon.   <br />  Suddenly Joe stopped and pointed up the hill. Two glowing eyes peered down at us, and blinked. We were still concerned about bears, but we couldn&#8217;t see what it was. It wouldn&#8217;t respond to our calls, so we slowly walked by beneath the orbs. At one point I thought I saw tall ears above the eyes, so perhaps it was a deer?  <br />  Everything went smoothly until we got ourselves lost on the approach for the first time. This happened when we reached the beginning of \'Boulder Central\' along the trail.  No trail seemed to appear down by the river, and I thought the trail went higher up the side of the canyon at that point, so we wasted time climbing the hillside to the base of some cliffs. After descending we quickly found the trail again and soon we reached the Meadows Camping area. Some climbers were just starting to stir, so we picked up the pace &#8211; we wanted to be the first ones on the mountain!   <br />  After passing a log bridge, the trail began heading up and right. For some reason Joe thought that this was the Middle Teton trail and that we had missed the turnoff, so he charged cross country off the trail and up the hill. I was regretting doing the approach in my stiff mountaineering boots at this time, and my blisters weren&#8217;t happy with the detour. I finally convinced him that we left the correct trail, so we scrambled up and left to intersect the switchbacks that headed over 1,000 feet up the moraine headwall for the Middle Teton Glacier. Below us the headlamps from other climbers bobbed, but soon they were out of site as we charged up the hill.  <br />  Soon the hill relented a bit as we began hiking through the moraine, stumbling across yet more hikers just waking up. From here we could see that climbers at the lower saddle were breaking camp &#8211; we&#8217;d better hurry. Soon we reached the snowfield, whipped out our ice axes, and charged across the snowy headwall, and then straight up to reach the saddle.  <br />  Sadly, the climbers at the lower saddle had beaten us up the mountain, as two groups were already beginning to pass the black dike.

A group of 3 climbers had already climbed the Lower Exum and were passing us! They took off up the chute to the right as Joe set up a belay and I took off up a fun crack. The terrain started out as a wide broken chimney, with more crack climbing higher up.

The guidebooks mentioned heading slightly west and ascending a left-leaning crack with an awkward lieback. The only cracks we could see looked much harder than 5.5. Perhaps if we walked up to them they wouldn&#8217;t have been so steep, but in our fatigue I guess the thought never occurred to us.  At this point the wind was blowing hard enough that we decided to head straight for the rappel to the Upper Saddle unless we could quickly find a way to the summit &#8211; we were almost 2 hrs behind schedule, as it was about 1:40pm.<br />  At this point Joe suggested we traverse around to the easier slopes on the east side of the summit. Below us was a friction slab and a short snowfield with footprints that led to a notch in the rock step. I looked at the snowfield- it was steep and disappeared over a convexity about 20 feet further down, certainly emptying into the Beckey Couloir. I didn&#8217;t like the fall consequences, so I suggested we belay each other across the friction slab and 10ft long snow crossing. Joe secured my rope in his belay device and braced himself behind a boulder as I walked down to the snow.  <br />  When I reached the snow I saw that the footprints were fairly old &#8211; this certainly wasn&#8217;t where the three climbers ahead of us went. I carefully stepped onto one of the footprints, only to have it disintegrate into a hissing stream of wet snow pouring down and over the edge below. The snow was superheated. Underneath was a very hard layer of ice, which was expected since I was at the interface of snow and rock. Still, things didn&#8217;t seem right, but I decided to try walking in the footprints anyways, stepping on the top of the ice where it terminated into rock.  As I carefully stepped forward, each footprint disintegrated into a larger slide. Suddenly my feet flew out from underneath me and I was rocketing down a solid sheet of ice toward the Beckey Couloir and a several thousand-foot plummet.  <br />  &#8220;Take! Take! Take!&#8221; I shouted frantically. It felt like I slid for eternity, but I actually stopped about 10 feet below where I fell. Still my heart was pounding, and my bare hands were dug into the snow. The ice sheet was so steep and slick that I was seriously weighting the rope, and I couldn&#8217;t stand up. I tried to tension traverse to some rock on my left, but the sheet was too slick. I coiled the rope hand over hand to climb back up, but progress was agonizingly slow. I then tried traversing on my shins and bare forearms in slush that kept sliding away beneath me, while Joe held the tension. After a few minutes of this I was back on rock, panting in fear and surprise, and moaning and groaning from the intense pain in my bare hands from the prolonged contact with ice and snow.  <br />  After I finished warming my hands we decided to look for the rappel. By this point I was completely sketched out and I didn&#8217;t feel like looking much more for a way up the summit block. We traversed down and to the west to the large ledge with the rappel. I was expecting to see a large boulder with colored slings wrapped around it at the rappel, but no such luck. It was nowhere in sight! Joe and I spent the next 20 minutes or so looking around for it to no avail. Finally, I thought I saw some white slings blowing against the cliff-side of a large boulder to the north. As we headed around to get a better look, we crossed beneath Sergeants Chimney and saw two ropes hanging down &#8211; the three climbers were descending from the summit!  <br />  This made me feel better, as our plan for rapping seemed less palatable now that the winds were really howling. Joe and I had brought one 60m rope and a 220 ft long retrieval cord, and we knew what to do with it, but we had never had a chance to practice with it. The idea of rapping on one rope, with the rope and retrieval cord possibly being blowing into a stuck position didn&#8217;t seem too appealing. We waited for the climbers to come down and then we told them where the rapp station was as we all carefully walked down the loose talus.  <br />  &#8220;Don&#8217;t worry about getting out your rope, guys. You might as well use ours,&#8221; one of the climbers said as Joe and I were preparing to stow the rope coiled around our bodies. Great! We could mooch a two-rope rappel line without the embarrassment of asking :-D  <br />  As we came around to the rap station we saw that it was composed of some thick cordalettes attached to bolts on the backside of a large stone &#8211; extra secure but nearly impossible to find from higher up! We all perched in line on a narrow ledge as the rap was set up. The wind kept getting stronger, and we all had to hold on. The first climber went down. He seemed to stumble as a gust hit him when he stepped below the first lip, and then he was out of sight. The line moved up and those closest to the rap anchor clipped into it for security.  <br />  After a while the first climber radioed that he was down. It took a while to establish this as the wind was blowing so hard that we had trouble hearing the radios! The next climber went down, almost at a run and then stumbling and nearly falling over on his side as the wind buffeted him, and then he was gone. A few minutes later a radio call came in and the third climber descended. Then it was Joe&#8217;s turn. The intense exposure and high winds had me very nervous and anxious to get down while also dreading the impending rappel &#8211; I imagined the wind spinning me around on the free rappel like a marionette, slamming me into the rock.  <br />   Soon Joe was off. Later on he told me that he had had a miserable rappel. He was blown around a lot, and as he was free-hanging in front of a slab, the wind dragged him over and into a wet chimney.  <br />  Finally it was my turn. I had never considered the tension the rope would be under when so much of it was free-hanging. I had to struggle for several minutes to get the ropes through my belay device. I had to struggle several minutes more to pull enough rope through to get a locking &#8216;biner in. I really wanted extra friction, given the conditions, so I spent several more minutes lugging on the rope to get a second locker through the rope and ATC. The extra friction was a nice comfort to have, as the wind got worse while I rappelled. At a major ledge the wind knocked me over and pinned me down for a short while. As I continued on I saw the rope disappear into a chimney &#8211; odd. Rather than work against the rop onto the face, I followed it into a chimney. The walls were slick and dripping with water, and gusts slammed me back and forth into the walls.  <br />  Once I was down Joe and I organized our gear while the others pulled down their rope. Sadly, when the knot was about 50 ft above them, the end of the rope got stuck. With the rope jammed and the winds getting worse, the climbers gave up their two ropes for lost and headed down.  <br />  Joe and I followed. The exposed move to get onto the upper saddle was a little spooky with the gusts, especially after I looked down into the Black Ice Couloir beneath my feet as I climbed over. Next we had to descend another 1,000 ft over rugged class 3-4 terrain. It was slow going, but the wind seemed to die down a bit. Finally we scrambled through the \'eye\' of The Needle, down some sketchy class 4 terrain, and we were home free on the climbers trail heading down the scree slopes &#8211; or so I thought.',NULL,NULL),(32350,975,24,3,'The Whirlwind','The wind got even worse around the Black Dike. Dust, grit, and gravel blew into my face and ears. When the wind blew on one side of my head, the pressure differential really made my eardrums ache. The sustained gusts picked up and were so strong that I had to seriously squat, scrunch my abs, and drag my arms and legs forward to step down &#8211; it was like walking through a river. Then the wind would reverse direction and hurl me to the ground. My legs were constantly getting torqued, and because of my fatigue, the wind knocked me down a lot. In some cases I just stayed low until the gust let up. At several points the wind dragged me along the scree as I was standing, and I had to grab boulders to stop myself. When the wind was really bad, I had to squat down and grab boulders as I walked along to steady my torso.<br />  This wind was driving me crazy. I was very tired and looking forward to an easier descent, but the wind made the descent harder than the ascent! For no rational reason I cursed the wind, flipped off the general direction it came from, and then it would reverse direction and spin me around. My wind shirt vibrated so hard that it made a loud humming noise as it turned into a blur of blue. At one point a gust blew both legs out from underneath me. On one moderate gust I let my limbs hang limp &#8211; the arm blew up about 85 degrees and my leg blew up about 35 degrees! The wind seemed to alternate between a 20-30 second gust and a 10 second break. It seemed to come from everywhere &#8211; even when I got behind large boulders it didn&#8217;t make a difference.  <br />  After what seemed like an eternity, I finally caught up to Joe at our cache on the Lower Saddle. We could barely hear each other over the wind as we packed out gear. Meanwhile, Exum guides were frantically trying to secure the shelters, which hummed like a roaring river. We prayed that the wind would die down once we got off the saddle before reaching the steep snow traverse.  <br />  As we descended the wind lessened slightly, but it still had plenty of punch. This made the snow traverse rather tiring and sketchy &#8211; about all I could do was squat down on my axe as the gusts came down the slope. I was completely exhausted physically and mentally at this point, and all the twisting of my legs had really done a number on my knees. I moved slowly as Joe rushed on.   <br />  I met up with Joe at the Lower Moraine Camp. The winds were still blowing hard enough to knock me down, and occasionally we&#8217;d get sprayed from the waterfalls pouring off of the Teepee Pillar and Disappointment Peak, several thousand feet above us. It was quite surreal to actually see the waterfalls stream <big><i>UP</i></big> the cliffs as the wind picked up!  <br />  I continued to limp down the trail, but the wind continued its pursuit. Even at the meadows we&#8217;d occasionally get knocked around and sprayed with grit. As we neared the Meadow Camp I though I saw a lot of people standing around some of the boulders. It seemed rather odd, and then I noticed that they weren&#8217;t moving &#8211; I was beginning to hallucinate.   <br />  Joe and I pressed on down the hill. He had taken the wind better than I, and would race ahead and then wait around until I caught up, and then he&#8217;d be off again. I prodded along in a stoic daze, knees sore, feet aching, vertigo gnawing. The hallucinations continued. Usually when I get exhausted enough on a climb I experience this &#8211; I&#8217;ll see patterns of color or texture that look like a person, tent, robot, etc. Rather than seeing a pattern that looks like an object, my mind seems to interpret it as the object first, and only after closer inspection would I realize that I wasn&#8217;t seeing what I thought I was. It did make the hike down more entertaining, though, as I tried to guess what was a hallucination and what wasn&#8217;t &#8211; and if it was a hallucination, what was I really looking at?  <br />  As the sun set this only got worse as the clarity of my vision became more muddled. The sun set just as we finished our last switchback, but rather than stop to get out the headlamps, I continued on with car fever. Joe and I hiked along in the darkness without speaking, focused on the one goal of reaching the car, following a trail that was only faintly illuminated by the moon.  As we neared the car I thought about our hike up in the dark earlier in the day and how worried Joe was about bears. For some reason he didn&#8217;t seem as worried now, even though we weren&#8217;t even hiking with headlamps turned on!   <br />  &#8220;Joe, why aren&#8217;t you worried about the bears coming down like you were this morning?&#8221; I queried.  <br />  &#8220;I&#8217;m just too tired to care,&#8221; he mumbled. It had been a long day and we both were ready for it to end. Finally, around 10:30 pm we reached the car. We had been on the move for over 21 hours, and I had been awake since 6:30 am Friday morning &#8211; some 40 hours.  <br />  We were exhausted, dehydrated, bloody, burned, covered in grit, and yet I felt like it was a great trip. Strangely, we finished the Upper Exum route and yet failed to summit.

We could see a direct snow couloir splitting the south east face of Gannett Peak and assumed this was our line &#8211; yet there was no bergschrund in sight. <br><br>A few hundred feet later, though, we could see that our snow climb was to our left, directly behind the Gooseneck, and there was indeed a gaping bergschrund blocking passage to all of the snow lines leading above the Goosneck Glacier.  As we approached the steep snow chute I looked at the supposed 5.1 rock to the left of the &#8216;schrund &#8211; it didn&#8217;t look like 5.1 to me!<br><br>I carefully walked up to the edge of the bergschrund and looked around. To my left the snow dropped about 5 feet down until the glacier pinched back into the rock, where the bypass was located. To my right there was a snow bridge about 8 feet above me, with a huge cavern beneath, dark blue and lined with sinister icicles. Above the bridge there was a wall of snow some 10 feet high that looked rather impassable. Ahead of me was a drop of about 4 feet to a snow bridge of unknown thickness with a few imbedded boulders. About 10 feet away was a rock wall covered with a veneer of ice several inches thick and a sliver of a snow ledge draping down from the snow chute to the ice wall.',30254,NULL),(32738,982,12,NULL,NULL,'After some debating as to whether we should try the crossing, Joel gingerly poked at the snow bridge and started across. So far so good. Upon reaching the ice wall he hacking the pick of his axe into the ice and proceeded to kick steps into the ice. A few minutes later he was at the snow sliver, staying off of it as much as possible as he traversed up and left onto the snow slopes above. Once he was through I followed. I held my breath and walked quickly and lightly across the bridge and sank my ice tool into the veneer. The ice was pleasantly plastic and secure. I gingerly sidestepped over, moving my tool with me in the ice, hacking away with pleasure, and before I knew it I was on the snow. The crux was over, but now we were worried about getting down &#8211; how solid would the snowbridge be after a few more hours of sunlight?',30255,NULL),(32739,982,13,NULL,NULL,'Anyways, onward we went, climbing up a nice sun-cupped snow slope some 45 degrees steep.

Our trip should be a success if only we could keep ourselves moving.<br><br>Partway along the summit ridge we met the lone climber. He had come from the east, but after talking with several parties that had been deterred by the bergschrund, he had somehow climbed the Dinwoody Glacier to the south of the Goosneck Pinnacle and ascended a chute to the north of Glacier Pass! He reported that the chute was steep enough that he didn&#8217;t want to downclimb it and was eager to learn how we got past the &#8216;schrund. After a brief chat (we learned that this was his 49th highpoint), he continued on the summit and we picked up the pace on our descent.<br><br>The snow slope above the &#8216;schrund was soft but not too bad, and soon we were back to the class 3 slabs beneath the Gooseneck Pinnacle. By this time both Joel and I were crashing. Occasionally a GU would recharge the system, but we were constantly slowing down and speeding up.<br><br>We reached the Dinwoody Glacier at 1:30 pm, and already thunderheads were building in the sky. Occasional rockfall could be heard in the distance, but the unmistakable sound of thunder had me psyched to get across the glacier and over Bonney Pass as soon as possible. Joel fell behind as I raced across the glacier. My pace was still slow, but constant, and I made it all the way across the glacier without stopping. After a brief break at the base of the talus slope, Joel caught up and by 3pm we were at Bonney Pass. Luckily by this time the thunderheads had begun to dissipate, but it was getting late in the day and we still had a long way to go.<br><br>Amazingly the descent into Titcomb Basin took longer than the climb out of it as the rock turned out to be a major pain to scramble down.

The terrain whizzed by as we began jogging the downhill portions to make better time.

A few minutes later another compass bearing led only to confusion. Worried about continuing on but not wanting to turn back, I laid to do decide what I was to do, as time was running out.

This isn&#8217;t the way to go! I need to downclimb!&#8221;<br><br>I thought this was strange. I had recalled from Bob Burd&#8217;s photo of the crux that he stayed very high on this part, traversing on ledges just beneath the vertical wall of the gendarme fin. It appeared that Kevin was unable to find a way to this section and was descending about 60 feet to an alternate traverse.<br><br>A short while later I heard &#8220;Uuu! Max! Watch me here! I might fall!&#8221;<br><br>Some more less comforting sounds followed, a light appeared then disappeared, and I sat in the dark, wondering. Shane and Vitaliy had both reached me by now, but I wasn&#8217;t going to start until Max left his belay. Kevin was still on lead. He was on lead for a lonnnng time, which made me wonder what exactly I was getting into on this next pitch. We began to get cold, but finally I saw Max switch his head lamp back on as he started climbing.<br><br><i><font color=\"green\">&#8220;Watching Maxim follow Kevin\'s lead was not much encouraging - I have not seen him ask for so much tension, and slack on one pitch, ever.&#8221;</font></i>',NULL,NULL),(33113,992,66,5,'Pitch 12 &#8211; Look, Ma! No Hands!','This next pitch was on very steep snow. I wouldn&#8217;t have minded the steepness of the snow so much if it had been deep enough to plunge my tool into, but whenever I tried it would always ram into a &#8216;thunk&#8217; of granite slab about 4-6&#8221; down. I looked to my right and saw the snow plunge off into darkness at about a 50<sup>o</sup> angle. Some of the steps moved as I stepped on them. Sometimes I could get a bit of aid with my axe, but overall I had to just walk very carefully on my feet with no hands. At the very best, I could jam both hands into the snow like Max &amp; Kevin did (I assume from the gaping holes they left) and use this as a very mild handhold. Occasionally I would strike gold and find a crack or crimper on rock inside the holes as I traversed out.<br><br>This lasted for maybe 60 ft before I reached rock where I could put in a piece of pro. I climbed up the steep corner to Max &amp; Kevin&#8217;s belay. It was indeed too small for more than even one person. I made a 3 piece gear anchor then climbed above it to make room for Vitaliy. There was a fixed cam in a crack, so I clipped into that. Feeling that Vitaliy wouldn&#8217;t  be able to make room for Shane, I resumed climbing up the next step, plugged in one cam, braced my stance, and clipped myself to it as a backup from the last two anchors. I belayed Vitaliy up, and he clipped into the equalized anchor and belayed Shane up, who climbed between us and clipped into the fixed cam. This was getting awkward!',NULL,NULL),(33114,992,67,5,'Pitch 13 &#8211; The Good Luck Pitch','As I racked up for what I expected to be our final pitch, we could see the headlamps of Max &amp; Kevin as they ascended the final couloir. It was an eerie sight in the dark &#8211; it made the couloir somehow seem more large and brooding. It also looked pretty steep. The speedsters announced that they were going to bivy in the notch at top. Vitaliy and Shane said they felt too beat to do the long snow climb and wanted to belay lower. Remembering a photo that showed a nice notch at the base of the couloir, we agreed to bivy there and relayed our plans to the others.<br><br>I started out on steep, insecure snow slopes like the last ones. I traversed another 40 feet or so and reached the point where Kevin had backtracked. I looked down to see where he downclimbed and saw a muddle of tracked snow going down steepening snow and around a large block. Most of what I could see was blackness, so I knew the slope dropped off real fast. I tested the first few footholds and found them to be very unpredictable in quality, and the steps seemed to disintegrate into granite slab beneath. If I fell here, there was no way I could self arrest and I would come into a big swing onto the anchor.<br><br>So I spent the next 10-15 minutes making my first truly needed Deadman snow anchor. The snow went about 2 ft before I hit slab, but it was very unconsolidated. I made the T of the T-trench right against the slab so that I could make it as deep as possible. I did some practice pulls on the webbing to see how the picket would drag in the snow. At first it was popping up, but with some adjustments of how the webbing was tied to the picket and how the picket was angled, I was able to get itself to (seemingly) burrow down into the snow when loaded. A pretty worthless piece, if you&#8217;d ask me, but I at least hoped that it could take a relatively static fall as a top rope anchor as I downclimbed to the block where I hoped to find more pro.<br><br>I downclimbed very slowly, sometimes purposefully collapsing steps as I stomped them down to make sure they&#8217;d hold. It was like aid testing in snow! At last I reached the block and . . . no pro. As I traversed beneath it I refused to accept this situation and spent some time digging in the snow before I found a crack. I happily plugged in my first real piece of the climb about 70 ft into it and began another snow traverse that was no better than the previous ones.<br><br>In the beam of my headlamp I could see rocks ahead and I approached these eagerly as if they were an island of safety. At first they were, but still no pro. I dug out more snow but wherever the rock planes met the cracks were either choked with ice or too thin to take nuts.<br><br><b>But aha! I had brought pins and a tool with a hammer!</b><br><br><b>But oh no! I couldn&#8217;t place them here! Crap!</b><br><br>I was on my tippy toes, barely balanced on the thin edges on the rock. While I have practiced placing pins, I hadn&#8217;t practiced placing them with one hand. The cracks were too shallow to set a pin and let go to grab the hammer, and I was more worried about falling off while trying to place the pin than I was in being unable to find a piece of pro at the next corner. So I kept traversing as the rock got steeper and the climbing got thinner.<br><br>After another 15-20 ft of traversing (maybe another 40 ft out from my one cam for the pitch), the &#8216;ledge&#8217; I was on just ended. I was stepping on two thumb-sized edges at the time, neither one big enough for more than one boot tip, spaced about 4 ft apart. I looked down with my headlamp, and the rock beneath my feet dropped away so steeply that the only rock I could see was very feint in the light.<br><br><b><i>Note to self &#8211; falling here will result in a big and unpleasant pendulum flight into space. DO NOT FALL HERE.</i></b><br><br>To my right the rock was featureless. I looked around for a long time for hand holds and footholds but I couldn&#8217;t find anything. I was at a corner in the rock, but it seemed scarcely more feasible. The corner didn&#8217;t have anything to grab or jam in it. On the left there was a 5 ft wall that topped out with a steep slab, but it had a lot of snow on it and as I swept my hand around to clean it off, I couldn&#8217;t find any cracks or features to crimp.<br><br>I tried cleaning out the corner crack some more and found a shallow groove. Too thin to get in a finger jam, too high to really be able to stick my finger into it, and frankly I&#8217;d rather have pro here instead. At least I could alpine aid off of it if I got desperate! As I reached up with a microcam my left foot popped off of the thin edge I was standing on.<br><br>&#8220;Guuuuuuh!&#8221; I blurted as I tensioned my body and pressed my outstretched hand into the corner to prevent from barndooring off the rock.  &#8220;Baaaah!&#8221;<br><br>Luckily most of my weight was already on my right foot, so once I caught the swing I shoved in the cam, grasped it with one hand in case anything else popped off, and clipped the rope to it with my other hand.<br><br>&#8220;Whew!&#8221;<br><br>Still, it was a micro-cam in a snow-choked crack. I set in a nut and gave it a good yanking with the greater confidence of my current top-rope, equalized the pieces, then again weighed my options.<br><br>I refused to give in so easily to yanking up on the pro. Besides, I didn&#8217;t see where else I could go with climbing or additional pro once I did so as all of the rock that had cleared off above it was devoid of any more cracks. With the greater security of the pro, I stood up higher and swept away snow with my axe higher on the slab, feeling around . . . and . . . hook!<br><br>The slab ended cleanly in another step above me, but with patient searching I managed to find a small pocket that opened into the corner! It was not very secure for my tool, but just large enough for a decent one handed crimp. Still no other handholds, no footholds to assist getting onto the slab, and I didn&#8217;t know whether I could get my feet to stick onto the slab once there. But if my feet held, I could probably reach out enough to a potential mantel higher in the corner with my free hand, hike my feet up, move the other hand up, and . . . freedom!<br><br>I crimped <i>hard</i>, yanked up hard on my right arm as I gave a little hop and shoved my left knee onto the slab and my right boot onto the corner to my right. I grunted a few more times as I hiked my legs up before I lost my grip and found some purchase! Up and over the mantel I went, and another 2-3 more between ledge traverses before I ran out of rope.<br><br>I can only imagine how I would have done this pitch without following Kevin &#8211; both in knowing that the snow could hold, and having a general idea of a route and that one would go through. If had could have done it without this assistance, I sure would have been MUCH slower! Kudos to Kevin for his badass lead!<br><br><i><font color=\"green\">&#8220;On this particular pitch I climbed last on rope, and psychological crux was a down-climb after a brief climb up to remove a picket (which protected the leader and first follower). As soon as I took out the picket I was [a ways away] over the next piece of pro with a difficult task - a crumbling layer (12cm or so) of snow over steep hold-less slab I had to down-climb. I placed my right foot on a previously made step, and it collapsed under my weight. I quickly regained my balance and watched the snow fall into the void. I regained my concentration - this is a no fall zone.Somehow I made my way down the slope to Shane, who was belaying me from the rock, and we continue to climb up towards Mark. On the last part we encountered a rock crux of the route - perhaps a poorly protected 5.7, that felt a lot harder in mountaineering boots.

The couloir looked a lot narrower than I had expected. Also, the notch I had promised Vitaliy and Shane was nowhere in sight. I believed that maybe I would climb about 60 ft or so up the snow couloir and find the notch on my left, so I started out with this idea in mind.<br><br>180 ft out the couloir was only getting steeper and the rock walls only hemmed me in more securely. There was no notch that I could see to my left. Oops. (It turned out from looking at photos later that it was there, but didn&#8217;t cut all the way through the ridge. It was small enough that the flat area was probably buried by snow in the couloir).<br><br>I shouted to Shane and Vitaliy to just start climbing. I put in a piece of pro for good measure and kept on climbing. The couloir kept getting steeper, but compared to the earlier climbing it was a breeze.

One more single rope rappel (or possibly some downclimbing) places you into a good chute for downclimbing. Basically, a single 60m rope and some downclimbing should easily get you down. From there, downclimb to Amphitheater Lake and traverse around Ken Minaret to South Notch where one more short rappel places you onto easy snow slopes for the remainder of the walk back to Cecile Lake.<br><br>The descent takes a while and would not be fun in the dark, especially if you haven\'t done it before, as it is exposed and would be hard to make sense of by headlamp. So make sure you aim to finish the route with at least enough daylight to get through the first two rappels. Otherwise you are in for an epic night descent or a likely summit bivy.<b>Bailing:</b>The route has a number of fixed pieces and bail gear everywhere. Nearly every pitch had some rappel setup, so with two ropes you can rappel the route, although be prepared to make some new rapp stations or leave a bit of gear.<b>Route Topo:</b><br><br>I brought copies of three different topos and have this to say:<br><br>1. The topo on Mtn Project was utter junk. We rarely were on anything like that topo.<br><br>2. The topo from Moynier &amp; Fiddler is pretty good, but a little vague and misleading at some critical junctions.<br><br>3. We had no trouble finding our way following the route description on SummitPost and using Peter Croft\'s topo in \"The Good, the Great, and the Awesome\". Bring these along!<br><br><b>Miscellany:</b><br><br>For the most part, all of the pitches were very long and sustained, though there were many rest along the way. We only were able to link some pitches with a minumum of simul-climbing and not too much drag because we climbed with 70m doubles, so we trimmed the route to 10 pitches and could have trimmed it to 9 if I had set up the belay before the 5.8 traverse at a better spot to reduce drag. Be prepared to do the route as 12 pitches if you bring a 60m or a single rope!<br><br>Also, the route is long and fairly sustained, and some of the moves higher up are arguably as hard as any on the direct start. So if you think you climb hard and fast enough to do the route, you certainly can handle the 5.9+ start and absolutely should do it this way for two of the best pitches on the route! I have heard this route (without the direct start) described as a good 5.8 route for the solid 5.9 leader, and I\'d agree.<br><br>The route sucks up gear, and nearly all of the moves can be well protected.<br><br>The face looks butt ugly and dirty in the shade, but in the sun it looks glorious.

Luckily I had a scrap of cardboard to use as padding, so I was at least a little comfortable and didn&#8217;t lose as much body heat to the ground from conduction. Besides reeking of BO from several days of being unable to shower, I was a little malnourished and extremely sleep deprived, having only gotten a few brief hours of sleep over the last few days, and sometimes it was hard to tell if I was awake or asleep as I was in a continuous dream-state. I wasn&#8217;t the only one sorely in need of rest, and as I nursed my callused hands there was a yelp as someone near me gushed blood &#8211; apparently they had an accident with their exacto knife.    <br />No, I wasn&#8217;t on some thrilling climb in the Sierras, although sometimes fantasizing about this made the nights easier. I was working my way through a summer architecture studio at UC Berkeley during the summer of 2003. I had joined Summitpost a few months earlier after Bob Burd had referred me to it over the previous winter as I was searching online for information about climbing Round Top.  Since then the site had mainly been an interesting curiosity for me, as well as a very useful resource for planning climbs.      <br />Then, one dreary night in Wurster Hall I got a mysterious e-mail from Dirk Summers. Who? I had no idea who this person was, but apparently he was a Summitpost member interested in climbing Mt Sill, one of the CA 14ers that I wanted to climb.  Great!  I had been having much better luck finding partners for my mountain adventures at Berkeley than I ever did in Utah, and this new possible partner was just what I needed since I had really wanted to begin climbing some technical alpine routes.  Up to this point I had only done crag climbing and all of my mountaineering consisted of class 3-4 scrambles. SummitPost had become more than just a reference for me, and from this point on it became an integral part of my climbing trips.    <br />Before climbing Mt Sill, Dirk wanted to do an easier climb with me over the summer so that we could get a better feel for each other. I couldn&#8217;t get enough time off from studio to take weekends off, so I missed out on a trip to Bear Creek Spire.  Finally my studio ended and Dirk suggested I join him on an easier climb near Yosemite with an American Alpine Club group. I still had never met this guy, but from the types of climbs he suggested and what insight I could glean from his SP profile, I felt like I would do fine seconding on a climb and that Dirk was well qualified to do a safe job leading.

Sadly his car wasn&#8217;t much larger, and fitting in was a squeeze.<br />Next we spent nearly an hour picking up our second passenger (I can&#8217;t remember her name). Every inch of the inside of her Berkeley apartment was covered with random colorful knickknacks - I could have sworn that she was a gypsy.  This lady had more stuff to bring than Paul and me combined, and every time we thought that we were about ready to leave she remembered something else that we needed to shove into the trunk and back seat. Near the end, Paul was beginning to get peeved, which made the situation all the more amusing. To top it all off, because she had been having some back problems, we lined the back seat of the car with pillows so that she could lie down for the drive.<br />Needless to say, when I arrived at the campground and met Dirk, he wasn&#8217;t nearly as strange as my car companions, which was quite a relief.',NULL,NULL),(33314,996,4,3,'August 16th: The Approach','It was a clear sunny morning as Dirk and I left the trailhead with two other members of the American Alpine Club.

Dirk and I would be climbing the West Ridge of Mt Conness, which required that we practically climb the goddamn thing via the East Ridge before losing 1,800 ft to reach the <i>START</i> of the route.  Dirk had had a number of ideas for what to climb on this trip, and we decided on this climb at the last minute, although I didn&#8217;t really have any idea what it was like apart from the 5.6 rating.

Seeing the mountain from this vantage point had me wondering what to expect on the other side!    <br />Soon the scenic ridge ended and we grunted through some sandy class 2 scrambling before reaching the large plateau above.

The rock was a little loose in places, but still great! After an awkward ascending traverse, I was at the first belay ledge, with an awesome view of the valley below. I tied in and Dirk took off on the next pitch.    <br />As I belayed Dirk I noticed a lone figure boulder-hopping far below - they were making really good time!

As we climbed along the razor-sharp arete, the fiery-orange light of the sunset illuminated the ridge.

I had thought that this would be a climb easily completed in a day, and due to inexperience, I only had jeans and a t-shirt to wear. No warm layers or a windbreaker, and this exposed ridge was windy! Since the climbing wasn&#8217;t very hard, and we both had headlamps, we decided to just keep climbing in order to stay warm, and hopefully, finish the route and descend.<br />Darkness was a two-fold handicap. First of course, was the obvious problem that climbing by headlamp is more difficult, and hence, the route finding slower. Another problem was that by climbing in the dark, it seemed too dangerous to free-climb the class 4. I myself certainly wasn&#8217;t ready to try something like that, so we ended up belaying the entire 1,800 ft route.    <br />Climbing on the ridge by headlamp was a surreal experience. Although there was a full moon out, Mt Conness blocked our route from its illumination. As a result, we could see the valley below quite clearly. In fact, at one of our belay stations we could actually pick out Half Dome! In the distance we could see the sparkling lights of Oakdale, and Roosevelt Lake shimmered below, yet we were in total darkness. While we could see the landscape around us just fine, when it came to our route, our worldview was limited to whatever the headlamp illuminated. Climbing became a much more enclosed experience, each of us seemingly alone except for when shouting commands.  At one point there were some headlamps down in the valley. They kept flashing, on and off. Were they hikers trying to signal us? Obviously, if we could see their lights in the valley, they could see our lights on the mountain. We couldn&#8217;t decipher what, if anything, the people were saying, so we climbed on, and eventually the blinking ceased.  A while later the air was filled with the echoing sound of coyotes howling. Still, we climbed on in our little bubbles of light high on the mountain.    <br />It seemed cruel that as the full moon came out, Mt Conness kept us in the dark, but the mountain wasn&#8217;t through with me yet. At one point I reached a belay that was on a small, steeply sloping slab that I could tell was dropping me toward the huge abyss on the south side of the ridge. Although the belay was secure, and I was still <i>sitting</i> on a slab, I am also a wuss when it comes to exposure. I muttered my displeasure with the airy belay as Dirk climbed around a roof and out of site.  Luckily I was in the dark, so at least I couldn&#8217;t see the drop off below. Then Conness finally let the moon out. As I sat on my windy perch, I watched with increasing discomfort as the moonlight illuminated the chasm below.  I was more than ready to climb on when Dirk shouted back.    <br />Dirk traverse left into the class 4 gully in order to save time on the next pitch. He was irritated that we didn&#8217;t do the route as purely as he wanted, but I was fine with the idea of moving to less exposed terrain - at this point I felt that staying on the ridge for 90% of the route was good enough! We had one more pitch of 4th class climbing and then we unroped. The climbing was suddenly easy class 2-3, with no exposure, so we dispensed with the belay and hurried up to the summit. As we scrambled the last few hundred feet, I asked Dirk how many pitched we had climbed. Neither of us could remember, having lost count somewhere over 10 pitches, so we figured we had done about 14 roped pitches on the route.   <br />Reaching the summit was a glorious occasion.

It looked like a blast and I was anxious to try it.  This time I seconded, trailing the thin cord beneath me. The final pitch was every bit as fun and interesting as I had hoped.  There were few places where I was able to solely jam in the crack. Usually I was in some combination of a hand and foot jamb, a foot smear, and a hand holding onto a small nub on the side, mostly for balance.  Dirk had left his pack at the off-width chimney to avoid getting it stuck, and he lowered a portion of the rope back down to me to tie onto our packs.  He hauled them up and then I followed.

Frankly, after traversing this ridge, I think the Thunderbolt-Sill traverse pales in comparison. This crest is far more varied, and it is far more sustained in difficulty, exposure, and commitment. I would say that the rock is also comparable if not better.<br>One thing that makes the crest fun is how rarely it is traversed. When I first attempted a traverse in 2010, as far as register entries indicated, no one else had visited the summit for several years. Dating back to the beginning of the original register, the southern summit seemed to only see climbers once every 3-5 years, and few were attempting a traverse of the crest, and of those, most were attempting the full Palisade Traverse.  I\'m not too worried about highlighting this climb making it crowded. Since 2010, it has seen more traffic, but more like one signed ascent a year. It is tough enough of an approach compared to the other sexier peaks in the Palisades that I doubt it will ever be nearly as crowded unless access were dramatically improved. Not that it is all that hard to access, but just hard enough, and probably mostly spared a lot of traffic due to that phenomena of 90% of climbers crowding onto 10 % of the routes (see Temple Crag, Mt Sill, N Pal, etc.).',31133,NULL),(33728,1006,1,NULL,NULL,'I first saw the Palisade Crest on a <a href=\"http://www.markpthomas.com/mountaineering/trip-reports/california/mt-jepson-palisade-crest\">Sierra Challenge outing to climb Gandalf Peak in 2004</a>.

I figured if I were roped I\'d be OK, so that was a perfect excuse to come back and do the full traverse, where a rope is more required anyways. From this earlier outing I had seen that the crest was amazing, and I had gotten familiar with the standard approach, which is via a convoluted cross-country approach up the South Fork of Big Pine to Scimitar Pass, one of the most unlikely passes in the Sierra.<br>Lastly, I want to point out that one of the things that made this climb so great was knowing so little about it, and the joy we experienced in working out the route, seeing it unfold, with the drama of uncertainty as to if we could find out way.

There was a 10 ft 5.5 crux that involved surmounting an awkward crack, but otherwise the scrambling was easy. About 40 ft from the summit Dirk unroped and scrambled up.

Once the rope was loose, we took off down the bowling alley.',31238,NULL),(33843,1007,25,NULL,NULL,'The sun set on us while we were about halfway down the chute, and our progress slowed considerably. The dust made it very hard to see, and there were some tricky sections that required care down climbing in the dark. Eventually we reached the bottom and began our long slog back to camp. Despite our attempts to ration water throughout the day, we had run out by this time, which would add to the difficulty of getting back to camp since we were very dehydrated.<br />  I was exhausted at this point &#8211; it had been a long and physically demanding day. Also, school had left me sleep-deprived before the trip yet again, and I was longing for a bed. My body slowed down and I stumbled along in a trance-like state. Every now and then I talked Dirk into taking a break, upon which I&#8217;d immediately shed my pack, lie down, and nearly fall asleep from exhaustion and dehydration. I was out of water and sorely thirsty.<br />  After what seemed like eternity, Dirk&#8217;s prodding me along got us up and over Thunderbolt Pass. Some lakes shimmered faintly below us, but apart from that, it was so dark that we couldn&#8217;t get any bearings apart from what Dirk could decipher from his altimeter.<br />  At one point we were thrilled when we heard the gurgle of running water beneath the talus. After some desperate searching we realized that the rocks blocked nearly all access to the water. I could barely splash some trickles into my water bottle, and then I gave in and tried to slurp some of the water out from a dirty hole.  That only increased my thirst and we quickly moved on.<br />  In the dark the large talus made travel very slow going, and on one of our breaks, Dirk accidentally dropped his new headlamp between some car-sized boulders. We couldn&#8217;t fish it out of the hole, so once again we were traveling with only one headlamp.<br />  As the night wore on I became more exhausted and at each break I had a harder time getting back up. Finally we could tell that we were nearing our camp. We determined this by matching up the faint lakes with what was on the topo to tell at what angle we were viewing them, and therefore, where we were along Dusy Basin&#8217;s upper slopes. Finally we reached a rushing stream beneath the talus and gratefully restocked our water rations.<br />  I was certain that this stream was the one that we had camped by, and soon I was following it up the slope. Dirk was skeptical &#8211; he didn&#8217;t remember the slopes around our campsite being so steep. Although his altimeter indicated that we were within 200 vertical feet of our camp&#8217;s elevation, it was nowhere to be seen. Since Dirk wasn&#8217;t convinced that this was the right place, I led the way, first up the stream to a lake that fed it (obviously too far) and then back down until we could tell that we were too close to the lakes.  <br />  No sign of the campsite!<br />  Dirk thought that it might be just over the next rise or so, so we continued on. At this point he was tired and lingered behind. I had a second burst of energy with the thought of being near camp and led the way up onto the ridge. We headed toward Bishop Pass, up and down the slopes, but to no avail. The search was exhausting and seemed to take forever. After a full day of climbing, and then traveling 2 miles over rugged talus to get back to camp, we just didn&#8217;t have the energy to keep going. Every bit of searching uphill was arduous, and our resulting frustration from &#8216;realizing&#8217; camp just wasn&#8217;t where we thought it should be weakened our morale.  <br />  After another hour of fruitless searching (ca. 4am) we gave up &#8211; the Bacardi would have to wait for another night.<br />  With each passing trip that I have had with Dirk I brought more clothing with me, and by this trip I had my fleece jacket and hooded ski jacket. After finding a rock slab somewhat protected by the wind, I set up my pack as a wind break and laid down for bed. With all of these layers, I was reasonably comfortable for a night at 12,000 ft out in the wind.

Needless to say, we felt like fools, but the humor of the situation didn&#8217;t escape us either.  Once again, the night that we DID have a camping permit we had to bivouac!<br />  In retrospect, we decided that either the tent was just barely out of my headlamp&#8217;s illumination when I was following the stream, or that its dome shape, with a yellow rain fly, had looked like a granite boulder when illuminated by my blue hued LED headlamp.  <br />  Despite the fact that we had to hike out and drive back to Oakland in time to return our rental car that evening, we hopped into the tent for a few hours of napping and some hard core Bacardi.',NULL,NULL),(33846,1007,28,3,'<font color=\"gray\"><b>Postscript: </b></font>','<i>Since this last episode Dirk and I have had a much better track record for avoiding bivouacs.

The campsites here are great, but sadly, all of the spots were taken by the time we had finished backpacking in from the Big Pine trailhead. This probably had to do with the fact that we had only managed to get a permit for the following night but headed up anyways. After some scouting across the stream, we had found a flat spot amid the jumble of trees and large boulders to pitch a tent, and now we were making the best of our cramped quarters.<br />This was my second trip with Dirk, and our aim was to climb the Swiss Arête on Mt Sill, a classic Sierra route. Joel was a graduate student at Berkeley who had joined me on some earlier climbs, and I invited him along for some more company. He would solo the North Couloir while Dirk and I were on the arête.<br />As we were settling in for the night, I noticed that I couldn&#8217;t find my headlamp. Crap! I must have lost it when we slept out at Tioga Pass! Ah well, the route wasn&#8217;t nearly as long as the West Ridge of Mt Conness and the approach was much shorter.

Joe, Dirk, and I were on our way up the remainder of the trail by 7am.<br />The trail switch-backed steeply up the rugged hillside before traversing back out onto the eastern flanks.  It was difficult to see our progress as boulders often obstructed our line-of-sight - the slope was covered with hundreds of large rocks that had probably fallen down from the glacial moraine above.  Just as we reached the end of the trail, we stumbled upon another camp. There was no water here, and the site was rocky and exposed to wind, but it was flat and was much closer to the Palisade Glacier.  The campers were part of a Mountain Search and Rescue Team that had come up to practice some rescue drills around the glacier. As we said our hellos I joked that it was nice that they were around in case we get in trouble. Little did I know that our struggle to come would provide them with some night time entertainment as they watched us descend in the dark from the warmth of their campsite.<br />Above the MSAR camp we followed ducks across a long series of granite slabs. Eventually the solid rock gave way to the Palisade glacial moraine, and our pace really slowed down. The rock was very loose, and many of the boulders were large enough to require some class 3 scrambling or some careful leaping (trusting that the boulder you&#8217;re landing on won&#8217;t roll, of course).<br />As we passed beneath Mt Gayley we finally had to begin walking on the glacier to gain the chute we needed to climb to reach the Glacier Notch. Just as our sources in Bishop had warned, the glacier was nothing but bullet-proof ice. Walking on the ice was very odd since you&#8217;d step up on your crampon spikes, and there&#8217;d be a half-second delay before the ice popped and the teeth dug in. The delay between these little drops as the crampons bit in was unnerving, and I made sure to wait for the pop&#8217;n drop on each step before moving up. Sometimes the surface would crack like a spider web as the ice popped.<br />I had been foolish enough to leave my ice axe at home on this trip. Although you couldn&#8217;t get enough purchase with the spike for a self-belay, it would have been nice to have for balance. Oh well, nothing to do but walk up and practice on my footwork! As I lamely chased Dirk and Joel up the slopes, Dirk would occasionally offer support and some suggestions on how to place my feet.<br />&#8220;Try to walk in the bottoms of the snow cups!&#8221;    <br />Nice &#8211; its almost like walking on stairs now!  As I hurried up the black ice I stumbled across an energy gel pack frozen into the ice.<br />Free food!<br />The wrapper was intact, so I freed this treat from the freezer and stuffed it in a pocket for later.<br />Soon we were at the chute, which was nothing more than a steep class 2-3 pile of loose rubble.  After some careful climbing we reached the Glacier Notch. With Mt Gayley to our left, the monolithic block of Mt Sill jutting up to our right, and the gorgeous Palisade Glacier lined by a vertical granite wall over 1,000 ft high, I felt exhilarated. This was some awesome mountain country!<br /><a href=\"http://www.markpthomas.com/mountaineering/trip-reports/california/mark-n-dirk-s-bivouac-trilogy---part-2-mt-sill\"></a>',31328,NULL),(33940,1010,8,NULL,NULL,NULL,31329,NULL),(33941,1010,9,NULL,NULL,NULL,31330,NULL),(33942,1010,10,3,'The Swiss Arête','At this point we parted ways and Joel took off up the North Couloir while Dirk and I donned our climbing gear.

This first part of the climb, although very fun, also seemed very lame.

I was surprised to see that as we climbed higher on the route, this figure summitted, descended, and then began free-soloing the rocky bulge lining the north side of the North Couloir. Joel later reported that the guy had summitted Mt Sill and beat him down the mountain.<br />Although the exposure was exciting, it also had me stressed. I&#8217;ve always been a wuss when it comes to exposed heights, but through climbing I&#8217;ve been beating back this fear. Still, it is always somewhat psychologically draining to be in a confined position on a cliff face for most of a day, and as we neared the final pitches of the route I was beginning to look forward to some reprieve.',31332,NULL),(33944,1010,12,NULL,NULL,NULL,31333,NULL),(33945,1010,13,NULL,NULL,'I knew that the next pitch would be trouble when Dirk began climbing very slowly, and some loud grunts and groans could be heard over the wind. We had been looking out for the reach-around move for a while and had yet to come across it. Perhaps this was the crux?  Once it was my turn, I quickly climbed up the rock and came to a narrow ledge on the south side of the arête, just below a chimney. The chimney was steep, and slightly overhanging on the first 5 feet. It angled a bit to the left for another 10 feet before shooting strait up the rock.  &#8220;Hmmm . . . this doesn&#8217;t look right,&#8221; I thought to myself. I also realized that while I have climbed plenty of cracks on sandstone in the southwest, none of it required entire reliance on hand and foot-jamming.  I looked at the 1,000 foot drop off below the ledge, back to the chimney, and back to the drop off again.<br />Crap.<br />I racked the first piece of pro and started up the crack. Then I began flailing about like some deranged lunatic. This crack climbing had me very sketched &#8211; I couldn&#8217;t tell if I could trust my hand jams, so I was afraid to pull up much in the crack. After climbing all afternoon with a large 30lb pack, a large pack that was now trying to pull me backward into the void and upside down, my arms burned out after struggling about 4 feet up the crack.<br />&#8220;Take!&#8221; I shouted, and the rope went tight. I hung on the end for a rest and tried again. I began popping out of the crack. After wasting some more time trying to climb the thing, Dirk and I communicated that I would try to haul myself up the rope just a little bit get past this short section. I tried to pull on the rope for aid, but that didn&#8217;t work very well. Next I pulled out a cordalette and tied a prussick. I couldn&#8217;t find a second cordalette, so I tried climbing up the rope with one prussick. I got about 2 feet further, cursing all the way. Just as Dirk was beginning to shout out directions for a Texas Prussick, I found another cordalette, tied a second prussick to stand up in, and I was off, up cliff face and over the headwall. After dispensing with the dignity of climbing the full pitch, I dispensed with the prussicks and quickly climbed the easy remainder of the crack.  <b><i>NOTE TO SELF: Next time I&#8217;m at the gym, I must learn crack climbing!</i></b>',31334,NULL),(33946,1010,14,NULL,NULL,'By the time I reached Dirk&#8217;s belay the sky was beginning to darken.

The terrain was getting steeper, which was a concern, so Dirk climbed off to scout out a route while I sat alone in the dark.<br />After what seemed like an eternity sitting in the wind, Dirk reappeared. He had found a way out! It required some tricky down climbing with one headlamp, and some occasional verglass on some of the narrower traverses to spice things up. Finally we reached the notch between Mt Sill and its subpeak. All that we had left was to descend the straightforward North Couloir to Glacier Notch, and down to the Glacier, and we&#8217;d be home free!<br />WRONG!<br />The chute was complete and utter crap. Every step resulted in a miniature landslide of talus, scree, sand, and climber. So much dust was kicked up that visibility with the headlamp became difficult.  Progress was painfully slow, and after descending about halfway down the chute, we stopped for a break.<br />Here I decided to make use of the energy gel pack that I had found frozen in the Palisade Glacier.

I found a 2-in-1 solution for this by climbing up into the rock on the side of the couloir. There was an angled slab, steep enough to slide off of, that made a nice bed and offered some protection from the wind. After wedging my thigh in a space between the slab and some other rock to hold me in place, I laid down for a nap.<br />All too soon Dirk had us rallied and we continued down the poop-chute. Finally we reached a point where we couldn&#8217;t help but walk on the icy neve. Luckily someone had placed some slings in the solid rock, providing us with a good anchor to rapp off. Dirk set up the rope and I was the first down, walking down the icy slope while hanging on the rope for control.<br />Yes! We were at the Glacier Notch! Now the rest of the way back was familiar and we&#8217;d certainly make it down!<br />WRONG!<br />We looked over the cliffs that dropped down to the glacier, looking for the right chute.

The rugged silhouettes of Mt Gayley and Mt Sill towered above, framing a starry night sky. After watching a few shooting stars, we each climbed into whatever shelter we could find from the wind.

I had occasionally heard the &#8220;Challenge&#8221; mentioned on the internet over the past 2 years that I had been in California, but I didn&#8217;t think that I had the stamina to participate.  After I climbed the 9,600 ft West Ridge of White Mountain earlier that spring, Bob suggested I try my hand at the Challenge. With this validation of ability, I decided to go for it.<br><br>Even though I had the strength and stamina to ascend over 8,000 ft in a day and climb for multiple days in a row, I still knew that at the time that I couldn&#8217;t keep up with the brutal pace of the Sierra Challenge, which lasts for 10 uninterrupted days, covering about 15-20 miles of hiking/climbing with an average of 5,500ft of elevation gain for each day. According to Bob, each day of the Challenge was &#8220;Not unlike climbing Half Dome, but more off-trail, more technically demanding, and at higher elevation&#8221;. In fact, the peaks all ranged from 12,500 ft to 13,700 ft in height, so acclimatization was an additional obstacle.<br><br>In June I moved back to Salt Lake City in order to earn enough money to finish my schooling at UC Berkeley, and this proved to be very beneficial to my training.  Since I was working about half the week, I made sure to get out hiking in the Wasatch Mountains for the other half. By the time I headed to California I had hiked around 95 miles and ascended some 40,000 feet since June. The day to day hiking on steep trails and cross country above 8,000 ft whipped me into shape and had me well acclimatized. I knew that I at least had a chance of completing most of the event.',NULL,NULL),(34287,1018,3,3,'July 30th','Here I was, sitting outside of the Fremont BART station on a warm Friday morning, wearing a pack larger than my torso and towing an equally large suitcase. I also had an additional daypack with me stuffed full of gear, and with all of the luggage I really stood out from the crowd of typical commuters carrying purses and briefcases. Like in earlier trips, people probably wondered what sort mischief I was up to, or whether or not I was crazy, or homeless, or both!<br><br>I didn&#8217;t have a car in California, but through an exchange of e-mails I managed to secure a ride with Dave Wright, one of the Sierra Challenge participants.  I had gotten familiar with Dave prior to our meeting by reading Bob&#8217;s trip reports, since Dave had joined him on all of the previous Challenges. Dave was an ultra-marathon runner, with a full beard and a quiet manner that made him easy to recognize when he arrived at the BART station to pick me up. From there we stopped by his place to get a few last minute items and then we were off to Yosemite.<br><br>On the drive to Yosemite I got to know Dave quite a bit more. He haled from Illinois, working as a university researcher in chemistry.  Later on he moved to California (why, I cannot recall), and after taking some classes from UC Berkeley, landed a job with a computer company in Silicon Valley. He was really into is running, jogging over 10 miles a day over his lunch break, but in recent years his knees had given him trouble. Partly because of this, and also because of his less-than-fanatical manner, Dave rarely kept up with Bob on the earlier Challenges. Usually he would get uncomfortable on the scrambling, or just couldn&#8217;t keep up the pace. Although Dave had summited few of the peaks, he would still enjoy himself on the trail at an easier pace. I expected the same from him this year as well, which helped relieve some of my anxiety as I knew that I would at least have some company on the trail if I got left behind.<br><br>Once we reached Yosemite, we stopped briefly for some stretching and a little scrambling on Lembert Dome, one of many granite roche moutonnées  in Yosemite. It was a steep friction walk up an ever-increasing incline of smooth granite as we arced around the mound. Luckily, Dave knew of a class 3 route that passed through territory that would otherwise be low 5th class rock.<br><br>Upon reaching the top some 500 vertical feet above where we had begun, we were treated to a panoramic view of Toulomne Meadows, with tiny Pothole Dome to the west, Mt Dana to the east, and Mt Maclure and Lyell seemingly floating in the horizon above their glaciers far to the south. These last two peaks would be our day hike objective on the second day of the challenge and they looked impossibly distant for such an endeavor.<br><br>After savoring the views and sharing some food with some adventurous tourists, we descended the steeper north side of the dome, descending a depression beginning at a cleft in the rock that continues through the cliffs to the forest below. This route was steeper then the other one, and the few loose rocks kicked splattered on the trees below &#8211; best to be careful here, even though the climbing was class 3.<br><br>About 15 minutes later we reached the car and drove across the Yosemite Border to some free camping on the far side of Tioga Pass &#8211; the famed Camp 9 that I had heard so much about. An aptly named camp at 9,000 ft just off the road descending from the pass, Camp 9 is a lightly maintained campground with picnic tables located about 100 yards down a trail from a locked gate at one of the switchbacks of the paved highway. It is a walk-in campsite used mostly by climbers, and it is the perfect place for cheap lodging and a night&#8217;s acclimatization before any hike or climb in the area. There I filled my water bottles,  organized my climbing rack , reviewed Mountaineering: Freedom of the Hills on rappels and gear placement, and then turned in early for the night so as to be well rested for our 6am departure time at the trailhead the next day.',NULL,NULL),(34288,1018,4,3,'Links','<a href=\"http://www.markpthomas.com/mountaineering/trip-reports/california/my-first-sierra-challenge-2004\">2004 Sierra Challenge</a><br><br><a href=\"http://www.markpthomas.com/mountaineering/trip-reports/california/nw-ridge-of-n-pk-and-n-ridge-of-mt-conness\">Day 1: North Peak &amp; Mt Conness</a><br><br><a href=\"http://www.markpthomas.com/mountaineering/trip-reports/california/mt-lyell-mt-maclure\">Day 2: Mt Lyell &amp; Mt Maclure</a><br><br><a href=\"http://www.markpthomas.com/mountaineering/trip-reports/california/basin-mtn-e-chute\">Day 4: Basin Mtn - Four Gables Traverse</a><br><br><a href=\"http://www.markpthomas.com/mountaineering/trip-reports/california/mt-haeckel-mt-wallace\">Day 5: Mt Haeckel &amp; Mt Wallace</a><br><br><a href=\"http://www.markpthomas.com/mountaineering/trip-reports/california/mt-winchell-e-arete\">Day 6: Mt Winchell</a><br><br><a href=\"http://www.markpthomas.com/mountaineering/trip-reports/california/mt-jepson-palisade-crest\">Day 7: Palisade Crest &amp; Mt Jepson</a>',NULL,NULL),(34289,1019,0,2,'Pine Creek',NULL,NULL,NULL),(34290,1019,1,3,'2013-08-24 - Pratt\'s Crack &amp; Sheila w Sean Hermany','Sean Hermany and I had braved the Rim Fire to drive to the Eastern Sierra in hopes of climbing the Red Dihedral on the Incredible Hulk.

How does one know when they are appropriately ready for such a long climb?<br><br>I usually go about goals in a meticulous and organized way, and in climbing I try to balance being conservative while pushing myself to improve.

So I asked people who had done the route what sort of less committing routes I should do as a progression to and benchmark for knowing when I was ready to tackle the route.
