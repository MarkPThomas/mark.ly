Consider adding the following validations/defaults later
Interoperability Considerations

Default precision:
   For geographic
   coordinates with units of degrees, 6 decimal places (a default common
   in, e.g., sprintf) amounts to about 10 centimeters, a precision well
   within that of current GPS systems.

Antimeridian Cutting

   In representing Features that cross the antimeridian,
   interoperability is improved by modifying their geometry.  Any
   geometry that crosses the antimeridian SHOULD be represented by
   cutting it in two such that neither part's representation crosses the
   antimeridian.

Polygon Validation

Polygon rings MUST follow the right-hand rule for orientation
      (counterclockwise external rings, clockwise internal rings).

(Not required, but also consider disallowing crossing line segments)
