# mark.ly
Personal website app and supporting app projects, with a focus on GIS, outdoor activities & trip reports.

My main Mark.ly project that contains these apps is in a multi-project single repo structure, with the idea that I may build it out as a [monolith-to-microservices](https://www.atlassian.com/microservices/microservices-architecture/microservices-vs-monolith) hybrid.

See my [Wiki](https://markpthomas.github.io/wiki/Apps_819631.html) for more more information.
